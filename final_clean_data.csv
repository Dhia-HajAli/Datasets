0,Exclusive–Watch: Cruz Torches Sanders and AOC's Bill to Ban Fracking,['Sean Moran'],"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) released a video on Tuesday that denounces Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s (D-NY) legislation to ban fracking, which Breitbart News has obtained exclusively. Cruz contends in the video that banning fracking would devastate the American economy.

Cruz released the video after Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez, Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR), and Rep. Darren Soto (D-FL) introduced legislation that would ban fracking nationwide.

“We are currently experiencing an American energy renaissance with the United States having now become the number one producer of oil and the number one producer of natural gas on the planet,” Cruz says in the video.

The Texas conservative warns that the climate movement “has become an emotional, primal scream rather being driven by science.”

The video continues, showing a clip of presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) discussing how by 2030, there will be “no more cars,” by 2035 “no more production of electricity.”

“The political leaders who are advocating for this are also advocating for massive government control of the economy and socialism,” Cruz added.

“Climate is a good excuse to say, ‘You’ve got to have socialism, or else humanity is going to die,’” Cruz said. The video then features a clip of Ocasio-Cortez saying that the world will end in 12 years if we do not enact the Green New Deal.

“Policies to ban fracking would cost 14 million jobs nationally and in the state of Texas would cost one and a half million jobs. It is hard to find something that would be more economically devastating,” Cruz said.

Cruz cited a study from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that found that a national fracking ban would eliminate 14 million jobs, as well as raise energy prices for Americans and increase American dependence on foreign energy.

The Texas conservative explained last year that fracking has worked to reduce American carbon emissions far more than the Paris climate accord or other environmental regulations, saying:

Fracking has become demonized. But fracking unlocked massive shale deposits of both natural gas and oils. Totally transformed the geo-political world. And in particular has resulted in an incredible shift from coal powered production to natural gas-powered production. Nothing – no socialist regulator, no Paris deal – nothing has had anywhere close to having an impact on carbon emissions as has a Texas oil man innovating fracking and moving away from coal to natural gas. I think that’s how we should address the environment through innovation that also produces jobs.

America’s use of hydraulic fracturing has allowed America to use more of its natural gas resources, which the International Energy Agency (IEA) said has helped reduce America’s carbon dioxide emissions.

The IEA wrote in a recent report:

A 15% reduction in the use of coal for power generation underpinned the decline in overall US emissions in 2019. Coal-fired power plants faced even stronger competition from natural gas-fired generation, with benchmark gas prices an average of 45% lower than 2018 levels. As a result, gas increased its share in electricity generation to a record high of 37%. Overall electricity demand declined because demand for air-conditioning and heating was lower as a result of milder summer and winter weather.

Cruz wrote in response to the report last week, “FACT you will NEVER see on the 6 o’clock news: U.S. emissions FELL 2.9%, or by 140 million tons, continuing the trend of the United States LEADING THE WORLD IN TOTAL EMISSIONS DECLINE since 2000.”

In contrast to Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders, Cruz has sponsored legislation such as the American Energy Renaissance Act (AERA) and the Natural Gas Export Expansion Act, which would remove burdensome regulations that inhibit America’s continued dominance in oil and natural gas production.

With Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders pursuing policies that experts say would hurt American jobs, it was unsurprising when one New Hampshire constituent said that Sanders’ “whole ideology would be destructive to the country. It’s anti-growth; it’s anti-family, anti-American.”",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/18/exclusive-watch-ted-cruz-torches-bernie-sanders-ocasio-cortezs-bill-to-ban-fracking/
1,Queen bans Harry and Meghan using 'Sussex Royal' brand,"['Rebecca English', 'Rebecca English Royal Correspondent For The Daily Mail']","The Duke and Duchess of Sussex must drop their 'Sussex Royal' label after deciding to step down as working royals.

Following lengthy and complex talks, the Queen and senior officials are believed to have agreed it is no longer tenable for the couple to keep the word 'royal' in their 'branding'.

Harry and Meghan have spent tens of thousands of pounds on a new Sussex Royal website to complement their hugely popular Instagram feed.

They have also sought to register Sussex Royal as a global trademark for a range of items and activities, including clothing, stationery, books and teaching materials.

In addition, they have taken steps to set up a new charitable organisation: Sussex Royal, The Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.

It has now been made clear that they will need to 're-brand'.

The Mail understands that, amid what has been described as a 'complex' situation, the 'fine detail' is still being thrashed out.

However, it is understood the couple have accepted that, as part of their new working arrangements, they will not be able to use the Sussex Royal name as they had hoped.

Harry and Meghan have spent tens of thousands of pounds on a new Sussex Royal website, sussexroyal.com, to complement their hugely popular Instagram feed. It has now been made clear that they will need to 're-brand'

The development is thought to represent a major blow to the Sussexes, who now face starting again and re-registering everything from their website to their charity under a new label.

Harry and Meghan first began using the Sussex Royal branding this time last year, after they split their household from that of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge – known as Kensington Royal.

The Sussexes' Instagram page, @sussexroyal, has amassed 11.2million followers – the same number of fans as William and Kate's account.

It was a natural progression, therefore, for Harry and Meghan to use the moniker for their new charitable foundation, due to be launched this year with the support of Buckingham Palace.

And as they secretly prepared for a new life in Canada, it was clear that Sussex Royal was at the forefront of Harry and Meghan's plans.

Dozens of trademark applications were made for everything from bandanas to notebooks – although sources have always stressed that these were preventative measures to protect the trademark from others, and never intended for commercial use.

The couple also privately commissioned a new website. It went live last month to coincide with their bombshell announcement, with the introduction: 'Welcome to the Sussex Royal community, your source for information on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.'

The couple's decision to step down as senior working royals and pursue 'financial independence' put a spanner in the Sussex Royal works and placed the Queen in an invidious position

The couple's decision to step down as senior working royals and pursue 'financial independence' put a spanner in the Sussex Royal works.

It placed the Queen in an invidious position, given her long-held conviction of refusing to allow working members of the family to profit from their positions.

Announcing Her Majesty's decision to allow her grandson and his wife to pursue a new life abroad, officials made clear that the Sussex Royal title would still need to be re-evaluated.

All members of the family – including Harry and Meghan – were involved in the discussions, and it is understood they all agreed that, in light of the Sussexes' decision to step back, their use of the word 'royal' would come into question.

Now, as well as giving up their HRH titles for work purposes and abandoning official appointments and patronages – including Harry's military roles – the Sussex Royal brand will have to be abandoned.

Such is the sensitivity around the issue, Buckingham Palace officials would not discuss the developments last night.

A source told the Mail: 'In many ways this is inevitable given their decision to step down, but it must surely come as a blow to the couple as they have invested everything into the Sussex Royal brand The Queen would have had little choice, however.

'The Sussexes' original plan – of being half-in, half-out working royals – was never going to work. Obviously, as the Queen has made clear, they are still much-loved members of her family.

National Theatre's artistic director says it will be 'business as usual' for patron Meghan despite Megxit Meghan Markle is thought to have told the National Theatre that her role as a patron will be 'business as usual' despite now living in Canada. Artistic director Rufus Norris explained that although bosses were not told of the Duchess of Sussex's plans to move, they are confident she will remain 'engaged' and are looking forward to working with her and her 'star reach'. Mr Norris was seen with Meghan shortly before her move to Canada was announced and she is set to meet with theatre bosses during a short trip to the UK in March. Mr Norris told The Telegraph: 'There has been no indication at all from her that her engagement with us would be anything other than business as usual. 'She has proven to be a very engaged patron and we look forward to working with her. She has star reach, she understands the nature of what we’re trying to do.' He added that despite reports theatre bosses were 'fuming' after Meghan and Harry announced they would be leaving the UK, this was a 'total fiction', reports The Times. Meghan was made a patron of the National Theatre in January 2019.

The couple are reported to have 'no regrets' about their decision to step down.

Discussions about their charitable foundation took them to the pre stigious Stanford University in California last week.

The foundation had been expected to launch in April, with the couple believed to be modelling the non-profit on those run by Barack and Michelle Obama, Bill and Hilary Clinton and Bill and Melinda Gates.

The Sussexes also recently appeared at a conference in Miami organised by banking giant JP Morgan.

They reportedly dined with Jennifer Lopez after flying in on the firm's private jet from Vancouver – despite previously calling for the world to embrace more eco-friendly ways to travel.

The appearance at the invitation-only summit is said to have earned the Sussexes up to £775,000. Local media reported that Harry appeared on stage with his wife and Gayle King, a TV host who attended Meghan's baby shower last year.

A source told the New York Post that the duke 'opened up to the wealthy crowd about the childhood trauma of losing his mother', adding: 'Harry also touched on Megxit, saying while it has been very difficult on him and Meghan, he does not regret their decision to step down as senior royals because he wants to protect his family.

'He does not want Meghan and their son Archie to go through what he did as a child.'

ROBERT HARDMAN: The Queen loves Harry and Meghan...but she has to stand firm

ByRobert Hardman for the Daily Mail

From the moment that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their intention to renounce royal duties for a more 'progressive role' overseas, one thing was never in doubt: that 'Sussex Royal' brand would have to go.

It might have sounded just fine and dandy to the team of super-slick US rights agents, intellectual property lawyers and digital marketing experts flocking to advise the couple on their new modus operandi.

But it was never going to meet with the approval of the ultimate arbiter on all things royal – the Queen.

The only surprising thing is that this may have come as a surprise to the Sussexes themselves.

From the earliest age, Harry has been raised on the sanctity of the 'brand' which has come to define his existence.

Almost no one else on Earth has grown up thinking it perfectly normal that both parents should have their own individual standards to be flown above whichever residence or vehicle they happened to occupy at any given moment.

Whenever his grandmother undertakes the most important of all her constitutional duties – the State Opening of Parliament – she is preceded by the heralds of the College of Arms, custodians of all things heraldic (from coats of arms to flags).

Meghan Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry attending a Creative Industries and Business Reception the garden of her High Commissioner's Residence, Johannesburg, South Africa, last October

The very thought of labelling the monarchy as a brand may appal staunch royalists. However, in this case, the analogy is not just relevant but crucial to the argument.

For the definition of what is and what is not 'royal' is not just a matter of regal whim. The Queen is actually governed by several pieces of legislation, including the Trade Marks Act 1994 and even the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property of 1883.

The Sussexes have not picked a fight with the Queen but with the law of the land.

Since time immemorial, people have attempted to trade on royal connections, which is why there have long been strict rules governing everything from the use of the Royal Arms to the use of crowns on cereal packets.

It is not a case of monarchs jealously guarding the perks of office, it is about protecting the public from fraud and misrepresentation.

No monarch wants someone buying faulty goods or being taken for a ride by some huckster claiming some sort of bogus royal provenance.

It was for precisely that reason that the Royal Warrant Holders Association came in to being in the 19th century.

To this day, royal warrants are granted to companies which must have supplied the Royal Household over a period of several years. If royal custom ceases, then so does the warrant. They are not bought or sold.

Nor are they a company asset – they are registered to an individual at the company.

Now, Harry and Meghan may have, very understandably, assumed that their own 'royal' credentials are beyond reproach, as indeed they are. After all, they retain the style of HRH, even if they will not use it.

But what applies personally to a member of the family does not apply to what is very clearly a commercial enterprise.

The Sussexes 'get' the importance of brand protection, which is why they have been so busy registering 'Sussex Royal' for every sort of potential commercial use (including, we are told, pyjamas).

So they can hardly object when the Queen and her officials, representing an institution which has been protecting its own brand for centuries, lay down what is very well-established law to protect their own 'intellectual property'.

Perhaps Harry and Meghan should switch their attention from their own elegantly constructed website to the rather more arcane recesses of the official Royal Household website.

There, they will find exhaustive guidance from the Lord Chamberlain's Office on how businesses can lay claim to any sort of 'royal' status. Much of it, in any case, is governed not by the Palace but by the Cabinet Office.

In other words, Harry and Meghan are going to have to square their plans with Michael Gove as well as Granny.

The official royal website might not have the beautiful arty shots like those on sussexroyal.com, but it is pretty precise.

Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex and their baby son Archie Mountbatten-Windsor meeting Archbishop Desmond Tutu in Cape Town last September

For example: 'Sections 55 and 1047 of the Companies Act 2006 and Regulation 8 of the Limited Liability Partnerships (Application of Companies Act 2006) Regulations 2009 prohibits companies (including overseas companies)… from being registered under a name which includes any of the sensitive words specified in the Company, Limited Liability Partnership and Business Names (Sensitive Words and Expressions) Regulations 2014, unless the approval of the Secretary of State has been obtained.'

The sensitive words specified in the 2014 Regulations include Royal, Queen, King…

Hours before leaving for his new life in Vancouver last month, the Duke of Sussex made that downcast speech at a dinner for his charity, Sentebale.

In it, he spoke of his 'sadness' at the rejection of his plans to carve out a new, privately funded semi-royal existence.

It was his reply to the statement from the Queen the previous day in which she had voiced her love and support for the couple in their attempts to create 'a happy and peaceful new life'.

It was widely seen as a rather churlish riposte, particularly given the generosity of the Queen's words at such a delicate time.

Let there be no more such grumbling. The Queen's love for her grandson and his wife has not changed one jot.

The Sussexes' Instagram page, @sussexroyal, has amassed 11.2million followers – the same number of fans as William and Kate's account

This issue, however, is just business. Clamping down on 'Sussex Royal' comes under the heading of 'duty' not 'family'.

The Queen's father had to make some very difficult decisions when his brother, the former Edward VIII, abandoned ship in 1936. This situation is nothing like the Abdication Crisis, of course, but it is every monarch's duty, first and foremost, to protect the Crown.

The Queen is not completely immovable with regard to her 'brand'. She is very sensible and often very generous.

Come the big royal moments such as jubilees, for example, she will announce an amnesty on use of the royal arms, allowing souvenir manufacturers a free run in producing all manner of commemorative tat – from biscuit tins to loo roll – for a specific period.

But that certainly does not mean a permanent free-for-all.

Of course, Harry and Meghan should be given time to reconfigure their new ventures.

And, of course, there will be a few grey areas and misunderstandings in the years ahead.

But the overarching rule remains the same: the royal imprimatur – and all that it entails – must always remain exclusively in the hands of the Sovereign.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8018043/Queen-BANS-Prince-Harry-Meghan-Markle-using-Sussex-Royal-brand-cost-thousands.html
2,Lindsey Graham slams critics calling for Barr resignation: 'We know your agenda',['Charles Creitz'],"Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham said Monday that critics who calling for Attorney General William Barr to resign have a political agenda separate from upholding the rule of law they claim to cherish.

Graham, R-S.C., told ""Hannity"" that Barr was doing his job when his office stepped in to soften a sentencing recommendation from four now-resigned federal prosecutors in the case of Republican consultant Roger Stone.

Stone has been convicted of witness tampering and lying to Congress in relation to the Russia investigation. The prosecutors recommended up to nine years in prison -- but Barr balked at the suggestion.

""Bill Barr stepped in and stopped what I thought was an unjust sentence enhancement - and to the people who want Barr to resign, we know your agenda,"" he said.

BARR UNDER FIRE AS DEMS VOW TO INVESTIGATE AG, CALL FOR IMPEACHMENT

""You are not trying to uphold the rule of law. You're trying to take a good man down because you hate"" President Trump.

Graham added that the counterintelligence investigation into potential links between Trump campaign figures and Russia -- dubbed ""Crossfire Hurricane"" -- was a ""danger to democracy.""

""I think it should never happen again. I think it was set up to destroy the Trump campaign, not protect it from Russian influence,"" he said.

""I think [former Mueller team prosecutor] Andrew Weissmann needs to tell the country why it took two years to do the Mueller investigation when he should've figured it out in the first week there was nothing there.""

Regarding Barr's action, which came around the same time as a tweet from President Trump slamming the initial Stone recommendation, several Democrats had expressed outrage.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said Barr ""ought to be ashamed and embarrassed and resign as a result of this action directly interfering in the independent prosecution of Roger Stone."" He also said the controversy served as yet another example of ""political interference by the president to alter the independent decisions of the Department of Justice.""

Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., didn't answer a question on whether Barr should resign, but said: ""I think the behavior is extremely egregious.""

Barr, speaking to ABC News last Thursday, pushed back on Trump's tweet while also defending his handling of the Stone case.

He Previously Held National-Security Jobs With The Cia', 'The Dia', 'The Department Of State', 'The House Intelligence Committee Staff. Twitter']","“Tune in to see Fred’s exclusive interview with Laura Ingraham on ‘The Ingraham Angle’ at 10 PM ET on Fox News Channel.”

It was crushing to read weekend press reports that my friend and former boss John Bolton plans to publish a tell-all book on his time as President Trump’s National Security Adviser. The book reportedly will be published in March 2020. Given the importance of protecting a president’s confidential discussions with his senior advisers, I strongly disagree with Bolton’s decision to release the book before the November presidential election and call on him to withdraw it from the publisher immediately.

I have known John Bolton for 30 years and served as his chief of staff twice, at the State Department from 2001-2005 and at the White House National Security Council in 2018. He is an exceptional national security expert and a man of great integrity. President Trump’s choice of Bolton was one of his best personnel decisions and was I very sorry when the courageous and visionary national security adviser left the White House after the relationship broke down.

Bolton played an important role in some of President Trump’s most successful foreign policy decisions, including withdrawing from the nuclear deal with Iran, moving the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, and the 2018 Counterterrorism Strategy. While there was some criticism of Bolton’s performance as National Security Adviser, most of it was unfair and reflected the difficulty of overseeing President Trump’s national security policies when careerists and Obama holdovers in other government agencies, especially the State Department, were actively working to obstruct and defeat the president’s policies.

CHRIS WALLACE: BOMBSHELL CLAIM BY JOHN BOLTON HAS TRUMP DEFENDERS 'SPINNING LIKE CRAZY'

Presidents must be able to candidly consult with their advisers without worrying they will leak these discussions to the press or obtain high-dollar book contracts to publish them. A book by a former national security adviser ahead of a president’s reelection bid may set a dangerous precedent since it could discourage future presidents from seeking advice from expert advisers on sensitive national security matters.

This is why executive privilege exists: to allow the president and other senior officials to keep certain communications and internal deliberations private if disclosing them would disrupt the functions or decision-making processes of the executive branch.

I haven’t seen Bolton’s book manuscript and I don’t know what’s in it. I take Bolton and his staff at their word that they did not leak the manuscript to the New York Times. But I believe they are still responsible for this leak since Bolton’s explosive book was sent to the leak-prone National Security Council for a security review in December 2019 so the book could be published in the spring of 2020. It also is inexplicable how such a sensitive manuscript could be sent to the NSC in the middle of the impeachment process. Under such circumstances, a leak of the manuscript was all but certain.

If a manuscript of this sensitivity was to be published at all, this should happen after the election, not in the spring of 2020. I don’t understand the need for a former National Security Adviser to publish a tell-all book critical of a president he served, especially during a presidential reelection campaign that will determine the fate of the country. There will be a time for Bolton to speak out without appearing to try to tip a presidential election.

Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, who stepped down in June 2011, published a devastating book titled “Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War” that detailed the incompetence of Vice President Joe Biden and the Obama National Security Council staff. But because he did not want his internal knowledge of the workings of the Obama administration and his interactions with President Obama to affect the outcome of the 2012 presidential election, Gates did not publish his book until January 2014.

Gates established a principled precedent on how senior advisers to presidents should write about their experiences. Given Ambassador Bolton’s long and distinguished record of government service, I believe it is vital that he follow this precedent.

Hynde, the lead singer of The Pretenders, wrote an open letter to President Trump on Twitter Monday in which she says her late father Melville would have 'enjoyed' his presidency.

She said Melville, known as 'Bud', was a huge fan of Limbaugh, who was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor after he announced he had advanced lung cancer.

But she admitted that she 'didn't always see eye-to-eye' with her father and that they 'argued a lot.'

Chrissie Hynde and The Pretenders: From Ohio to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame The Pretenders were formed in 1978 in London, five years after Chrissie Hynde moved there from her home town of Akron, Ohio. She first worked at the weekly music paper NME and later worked at punk pioneer Malcolm McLaren and fashion designer Vivienne Westwood's iconic clothes boutique on the King's Road, in Chelsea. The original band was made up of Hynde as lead singer, songwriter and rhythm guitarist, James Honeyman-Scott on lead guitar and keyboards, Pete Farndon on bass and drummer Martin Chambers. The band went on to have a series of hits including Brass in Pocket (1979), Talk of the Town (1980), Message of Love (1981), Back on the Chain Gang (1982), Middle of the Road (1983), 2000 Miles (1983), Don't Get Me Wrong (1986), My Baby (1986) and I'll Stand by You (1994). The Pretenders were hit by a double tragedy in the 80s when Honeyman-Scott died of heart failure as a result of cocaine intolerance in 1982 and then Farndon, who was sacked for excessive drug use, was found dead the following year after taking heroin and passing out in his bathtub and drowning. Hynde continued the band with several personnel changes over the years. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005. The Pretenders' most recent album, Alone, was released in 2016 but Hynde was the only band member involved and was backed up by session musicians.

She goes on to say her father 'would be mortified' that she was joining the Assange protest, but added that she feels 'strongly enough' to go.

She added: 'What I believe is the right thing; to protest further punishment of a man who sought to defend Freedom, albeit in a way you rightly disagree with.

'I know Mr. Assange broke the law (as i have done defending the treatment of animals) but I believe he has been duly punished and should now be set free.

'Please consider my plea. Yours truly, Chrissie Hynde of @ThePretendersHQ (@MrsC_Assange).'

Her tweets received a mixed response with many praising her honesty and otyhers criticising her stance.

'Your approach is civil and respectful. We need more dialogue like that. Both sides could learn from this approach,' one Twitter user wrote.

Another wrote: 'Thanks for being honest and real! I respect any position you take.

'I love the honesty about your dad and your ability to take the high road! We can all get along even if we don’t always agree! God Bless!!'

Others said they were 'disappointed' with one saying: 'I always wondered how he got permission to use your song.

""You’re talking about tens of thousands of victims. This will be the largest bankruptcy the country has ever seen, and likely one of the largest corporate bankruptcies.”

The national organization said they made the move to fairly compensate victims harmed during their time in scouting and to keep the 100-year-old nonprofit running for years to come.

A Victims Compensation Trust will reportedly be set up during the bankruptcy process, which the organization says will provide ""equitable compensation to victims.""

We are outraged that there have been times when individuals took advantage of our programs to harm innocent children,"" said Roger Mosby, president and chief executive officer of the BSA.

""While we know nothing can undo the tragic abuse that victims suffered, we believe the Chapter 11 process – with the proposed Trust structure – will provide equitable compensation to all victims while maintaining the BSA's important mission,"" he added.

6,Roger Stone jury foreperson's anti-Trump social media posts surface after she defends DOJ prosecutors,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']","Former Memphis City Schools Board President Tomeka Hart revealed Wednesday that she was the foreperson of the jury that convicted former Trump adviser Roger Stone on obstruction charges last year -- and soon afterward, her history of Democratic activism and a string of her anti-Trump, left-wing social media posts came to light.

Hart even posted specifically about the Stone case before she was selected to sit on the jury, as she retweeted an argument mocking those who considered Stone's dramatic arrest in a predawn raid by a federal tactical team to be excessive force. She also suggested President Trump and his supporters are racist and praised the investigation conducted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, which ultimately led to Stone's prosecution.

Meanwhile, it emerged that U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson had denied a defense request to strike a potential juror who was Obama-era press official with admitted anti-Trump views -- and whose husband worked at the same Justice Department division that handled the probe leading to Stone's arrest. And, another Stone juror, Seth Cousins, donated to former Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke and other progressive causes, federal election records reviewed by Fox News show.

The revelations came as Trump has called the handling of Stone's prosecution ""ridiculous"" and a demonstrably unfair ""insult to our country."" They raised the prospect that Stone's team could again seek a new trial, especially if Hart provided inaccurate responses under oath on her pretrial questionnaires concerning social media activity.

The drama began when Hart confirmed to CNN and other media organizations Wednesday that she had written a Facebook post supporting the Justice Department prosecutors in the Stone case who abruptly stepped down from their posts on Tuesday, saying she ""can't keep quiet any longer."" The prosecutors apparently objected after senior DOJ officials overrode their recommendation to Jackson that Stone face up to 9 years in prison.

DOJ PROSECUTORS QUIT EN MASSE; TRUMP SAYS STONE CASE A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE

""I want to stand up for Aaron Zelinsky, Adam Jed, Michael Marando, and Jonathan Kravis -- the prosecutors on the Roger Stone trial,"" Hart wrote in the post. ""It pains me to see the DOJ now interfere with the hard work of the prosecutors. They acted with the utmost intelligence, integrity, and respect for our system of justice.""

Hart added: ""As foreperson [of the jury], I made sure we went through every element, of every charge, matching the evidence presented in the case that led us to return a conviction of guilty on all 7 counts.""

Independent journalist Mike Cernovich, not CNN, then first reported that a slew of Hart's other publicly available Twitter and Facebook posts readily suggested a strong political bias. Some of Hart's posts were written as Stone's trial was in progress.

Hart, who unsuccessfully ran for Congress as a Democrat in 2012, quoted someone in an August 2017 tweet referring to Trump as a member of the KKK.

In January 2019, she retweeted a post by pundit Bakari Sellers, who noted that ""Roger Stone has y'all talking about reviewing use of force guidelines,"" before suggesting that racism was the reason for all the attention Stone's arrest had received from conservatives.

In August 2019, Hart called all Trump supporters ""racist.""

""Gotta love it!"" Hart wrote on Jan. 13, 2018, in response to a news report that a vulgarity had been projected onto the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.

A week later, on Jan. 21, 2018, she shared an opinion piece entitled, ""What’s so extremely, uniquely wrong about Trump’s presidency.""

On March 24, 2019, Hart shared a Facebook post saying that Republicans who complained about Mueller's probe were deliberately ""ignoring the numerous indictments, guilty pleas, and convictions of people in 45’s inner-circle,"" referring to Trump.

Most of Hart's posts were from before she was selected to sit on the Stone jury late 2019. But, on Nov. 15, 2019 -- the day she voted to convict Stone on seven counts of obstruction, witness tampering and making false statements to Congress -- Hart tweeted two ""heart"" emojis, followed by two pump-fist emojis.

(None of Stone's charges accused him of engaging in a criminal conspiracy with Russia or any other actors concerning election interference; instead, his offenses related to his statements concerning his contacts with WikiLeaks and others.)

Hart's tweet linked to a Facebook post that has since been taken down from public view.

If Hart have provided misleading answers on her jury form concerning her political or social media activity, her views on Trump and the Russia probe, or other related matters, there could be grounds for Stone's team to seek a new trial, legal experts told Fox News.

FLASHBACK: FORMER FBI DIRECTOR MCCABE ADMITS LYING TO INVESTIGATORS, STILL NO CHARGES

Hart did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment. The Memphis Commercial Appeal noted that she was a native of the city and had served a term as the president of its school board.

Hart's posts surfaced the same day that Jackson, who oversaw the Stone case, unsealed her order from earlier this month denying Stone's request for a new trial.

Stone's team argued that an unnamed juror had misled the court concerning his or her exposure to the media during the case, and also had some potential bias because of his or her work with the IRS, which sometimes has interfaced with the DOJ on criminal matters.

But, Jackson shot down the motion for a new trial, saying the juror's potential bias was not demonstrated -- and even if it were, it wasn't significant enough to warrant the drastic step of calling for a new trial.

Courts allow for a new trial, Jackson noted, when ""a serious miscarriage of justice may have occured."" Bias is a permissible reason to remove a juror or call for a new trial only in ""extreme situations where the relationship between a prospective juror and some aspect of the litigation is such that it is highly unlikely that the average person could remain impartial in his deliberations under the circumstances.""

READ JACKSON'S ORDER SHUTTING DOWN MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL

Jackson, who was appointed to the bench by President Barack Obama, also took a shot at Stone's team for failing to uncover the information sooner.

""The defense could have easily conducted the same Internet search included in the instant motion and could have raised concerns at that time,"" Jackson wrote.

Fox News reported earlier Tuesday that top brass at the DOJ were ""shocked"" that prosecutors handling the Stone case had recommended Monday night that Jackson sentence the 67-year-old Stone to between 87 and 108 months in prison. The prosecutors asserted in the Monday filing that Stone's conduct post-indictment -- including violating the judge's social media gag orders -- merited a sentence much longer than the 15 to 21 months that the defense said was actually advisable under the federal sentencing guidelines.

In a new, amended filing Tuesday afternoon, the DOJ told Jackson that the government ""respectfully submits that a sentence of incarceration far less than 87 to 108 months' imprisonment would be reasonable under the circumstances,"" but that the government ""ultimately defers to the court as to the specific sentence to be imposed.""

Government officials wrote in the amended filing that while it was ""technically"" possible to argue that Stone deserved the severe federal sentencing enhancement for threatening physical harm to a witness, such a move would violate the spirit of the federal guidelines.

It would place Stone in a category of the guidelines that ""typically applies in cases involving violent offenses, such as armed robbery, not obstruction cases,"" the government argued, noting that Stone's ""advanced age, health, personal circumstances, and lack of criminal history"" also counseled against the harsh penalty.

Specifically, prosecutors said that although Stone allegedly had threatened witness Randy Credico's therapy dog, Bianca -- saying he was ""going to take that dog away from you"" -- it was important to recognize that Credico, a New York radio host, has acknowledged that he ""never in any way felt that Stone himself posed a direct physical threat to me or my dog.""

The government continued, ""If the court were not to apply the eight-level enhancement for threatening a witness with physical injury, it would result in the defendant receiving an advisory guidelines range of 37 to 46 months, which as explained below is more in line with the typical sentences imposed in obstruction cases.""

READ THE DOJ'S NEW FILING ; READ THE ORIGINAL FILING REQUESTING A LONGER SENTENCE

A senior DOJ official confirmed to Fox News that senior leadership officials there made the call to reverse the initial sentencing recommendation, saying the filing on Monday evening was not only extreme, but also substantially inconsistent with how the prosecutors had briefed DOJ leadership they would proceed on the case. The ""general communication"" between the U.S. Attorney's Office and the main DOJ had led senior officials to expect a more moderate sentence, the official told Fox News.

“It's surprising that would be the line in the sand -- an amended filing,"" a senior DOJ official told Fox News, adding that the problem with the original sentencing recommendation was it told the judge that the only way to serve justice was a lengthy sentence.

“We're backing off from, 'It has to be this,'"" the DOJ source told Fox News. “The amended filing says it's a serious crime, and prison time is appropriate; we're just saying it doesn't have to be 87 to 108 months.""

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Trump said he stayed out of internal DOJ deliberations, but strongly opposed their initial sentencing recommendation.

""I stay out of things to a degree that people wouldn't believe,"" Trump said. He added that the initial recommendation was ""ridiculous"" and called it ""an insult to our country.""

Later, Trump took a shot at Jackson, writing on Twitter: ""Is this the Judge that put Paul Manafort in SOLITARY CONFINEMENT, something that not even mobster Al Capone had to endure? How did she treat Crooked Hillary Clinton? Just asking!""

7,"Bloomberg says many 'black and Latino males' don't 'know how to behave in the workplace,' in newly uncovered 2011 video","['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']","While promoting a $127 million, three-year initiative to help minorities in the workplace in 2011, then-New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg declared that there's ""this enormous cohort of black and Latino males"" who ""don't know how to behave in the workplace"" and ""don't have any prospects.""

The head-turning comments in a resurfaced interview were just the latest headache for the multibillionaire's campaign. In the past week, Bloomberg has been confronted with his previous claims that farming doesn't take much intelligence and that ""anybody"" could do it, as well as his insistence that the way to get guns ""out of the kids' hands is to throw them up against the wall and frisk them."" Additionally, Bloomberg has taken heat for suggesting that a functioning health care system must let the elderly die.

Speaking to PBS in the 2011 interview, Bloomberg noted that he had donated $30 million from his foundation to Open Society Foundations, the network established by liberal billionaire financier Goerge Soros, toward the new plan to enhance employment among minorities.

'THROW THEM UP AGAINST THE WALL AND FRISK THEM': BLOOMBERG DEFENDS STOP AND FRISK IN NEW AUDIO

Taxpayers and Soros himself contributed to the jobs initiative, which set up job recruitment centers in public housing projects, placed probation centers in ""high-risk"" areas, and linked black and Latino success in schools to Department of Education ""progress reports.""

“Well, for a long time, people have said there's nothing you can do about it, but blacks and Latinos score terribly in school testing compared to whites and Asians. If you look at our jails, it’s predominantly minorities,” Bloomberg said in the interview.

He added: “If you look at where crime takes place, it’s in minority neighborhoods. If you look at who the victims and the perpetrators are, it’s virtually all minorities. This is something that has gone on for a long time. I assume it’s prevalent elsewhere but it’s certainly true in New York City. And for many, many years, people said there's just nothing you can do about it.""



In the past 10 years, Bloomberg said, the city had made some progress and diversified its police force – but troubles remained.

'ANYBODY' CAN LEARN TO FARM VERY QUICKLY, BLOOMBERG ANNOUNCES

“Nevertheless, there's this enormous cohort of black and Latino males, age, let’s say, 16 to 25,” Bloomberg said, “that don't have jobs, don't have any prospects, don't know how to find jobs, don't know what their skill sets are, don't know how to behave in the workplace where they have to work collaboratively and collectively.”

Some possible solutions, Bloomberg suggested, might be reuniting some at-risk youths with their fathers.

""There will be jobs, if we can get these kids – uh, get their families together, even if their fathers don't live with their mothers, or have never been married, or even they're in jail, get the fathers engaged,"" Bloomberg added. ""Lot of statistics show that if the father is engaged, it gives the kid some understanding that he's heading down the wrong path – and assign mentors to them.""

He went on: ""A lot of these kids – it isn't that they're bad kids – it's that once they've made a mistake, it's very difficult to recover from that. But we have an obligation to them – if not for compassionate reasons, just for selfish reasons. Three-quarters of all kids in New York City that go to jail serve a period and come out, go right back to jail. Three-quarters of them. ... We've just got to break that cycle.""

The comments drew the ire of both conservatives and some progressive activists, who have cautioned that Bloomberg might effectively buy his way to the nomination – and then fail catastrophically in a general election.

""For Bloomberg supporters (or those of you who, deep down, know you will be but aren't prepared to come out of the closet yet), a genuine question: Do you disbelieve that a huge portion of the left will refuse to vote for him, or do you believe he can win despite that?"" asked journalist Glenn Greenwald.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bloomberg-says-many-black-and-latino-males-dont-know-how-to-behave-in-the-workplace
8,Bloomberg implied farming doesn't take intelligence in 2016 comments,"['Tyler Olson', 'Tyler Olson Covers Politics For Foxnews.Com. You Can Contact Him At Tyler.Olson Foxnews.Com', 'Follow Him On Twitter At']","Presidential candidate and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg appeared to belittle both farmers and factory workers in 2016 comments made at a university forum, continuing a trend of old remarks resurfacing to plague the billionaire's bid for the Democratic nomination.

Joining the Distinguished Speakers Series at the University of Oxford Saïd Business School, Bloomberg was responding to a question about whether it is possible to unite people in middle America and the coasts. One of the issues standing in the way of that, Bloomberg said, was the inability of blue-collar workers to adapt to the information economy even if they have their education subsidized.

""The agrarian society lasted 3,000 years and we could teach processes. I could teach anybody, even people in this room, no offense intended, to be a farmer,"" Bloomberg said. ""It's a process. You dig a hole, you put a seed in, you put dirt on top, add water, up comes the corn. You could learn that. Then we had 300 years of the industrial society. You put the piece of metal on the lathe, you turn the crank in the direction of the arrow and you can have a job. And we created a lot of jobs. At one point, 98 percent of the world worked in agriculture, now it's 2 percent in the United States.""

BERNIE SANDERS TEARS INTO MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, SAYS DEM BILLIONAIRE CAN'T BEAT TRUMP

Bloomberg continued: ""Now comes the information economy and the information economy is fundamentally different because it's built around replacing people with technology and the skill sets that you have to learn are how to think and analyze, and that is a whole degree level different. You have to have a different skill set, you have to have a lot more gray matter. It's not clear the teachers can teach or the students can learn, and so the challenge of society of finding jobs for these people, who we can take care of giving them a roof over their head and a meal in their stomach and a cell phone and a car and that sort of thing. But the thing that is the most important, that will stop them from setting up a guillotine someday, is the dignity of a job""

Bloomberg, who has faced a litany of negative stories in the past week about his past comments regarding women, African-Americans and others, concluded his point, saying, ""the problem is not the redistribution of wealth, it is the job where you go in every day.""

TOM STEYER: KEY TO NEVADA. SOUTH CAROLINA SUCCESS IS SPENDING TIME THERE, NOT JUST MONEY

The former mayor's comments drew the ire of many on Twitter, including the organization ""People for Bernie,"" which is dedicated to boosting Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. and began before the senator announced his candidacy.

""Time and again we see Bloomberg insulting the middle class and the working class, union members and not yet union members,"" the organization tweeted. ""Maybe it's time for pundits to stop pretending he's just another candidate. Bloomberg is an oligarch spending his play money to buy the White House.""

In a statement on the video, Bloomberg campaign spokesman Stu Loeser accused Trump allies of taking the video out of context. While shorter clips of the speech were circulating on social media, Fox News reflected the full context of the video in this report and the full talk is embedded above.

""The Trump team cut off the first part of Mike's sentence where he said 'if you think about the agrarian society [that] lasted 3000 years, we could teach processes,'"" he said. ""Mike wasn't talking about today's farmers at all, and Team Trump is deliberately misleading Americans because Donald Trump’s erratic policies have devastated American farms, including a 20% increase in US Farm bankruptcies last year.""

The Bloomberg campaign's statement, however, does not mention that he was talking about educating modern farmers for a modern economy in the video and does not address his comment on farmers and factory workers needing more ""gray matter"" to do jobs in the information economy.

Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh also denied circulating edited clips of the remarks, saying in a statement: “No, but it’s enlightening to know how much disdain he holds for farmers and factory workers. He’s flattering himself if he thinks we’re paying that much attention to him. He’s got a bunch of other Democrats to worry about, and besides that, his worst enemies are himself and his public record.”

Rep. Fred Keller, R-Pa., who represents a very large, rural district with over 10,500 farms, condemned Bloomberg's comments in a Monday morning statement.

""I bet Mike Bloomberg could not even change a tire on his car, let alone deal with the myriad of issues farmers deal with on a daily basis. Bloomberg's comments about the intelligence of farmers are ignorant, derogatory, and small-minded,"" Keller said. ""Unlike Mike Bloomberg, President Donald Trump has stood up for Pennsylvania's farmers and hardworking individuals across our nation. Thanks to President Trump's Administration, 17,000 Pennsylvania agricultural jobs will benefit as a result of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and better trade deals with countries like China.""

In another moment during his Oxford remarks, Bloomberg implied that more intelligent people are more likely to believe in individual rights.

""We, the intelligentsia, the people who could make it in this room,"" Bloomberg told the Oxford crowd, ""We believe in a lot of things in terms of equality and protecting individual rights that make no sense to the vast bulk of people. They're not opposed to the idea of you having some rights, but there's a fundamental disconnect between us believing the rights of the individual come first and the general belief around the world, I think it's fair to say, that the rights of society come first.""

Bloomberg, who has made clear he is willing to spend $1 billion or more on his presidential campaign, is counting on his advertising advantage to put him over the top in Super Tuesday states after deciding to skip Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.

That strategy appears to be making at least some progress, as Bloomberg registered at 10 percent in the latest national Fox News poll after entering the presidential race late and missing every debate so far. And he has appeared to make even more progress since that poll's late-January release, checking in at third place nationally with 14.2 percent in the RealClearPolitics national average of polls.

9,Christians the most persecuted group in world for second year: Study,"['Perry Chiaramonte', ""Perry Chiaramonte Is A Producer With Fox News Channel'S Investigative Unit. Follow Him On Twitter At""]","Christians continued to be the most persecuted group across the globe in 2016, according to a study.

The upcoming report from Italian-based Center for Studies on New Religions, determined that 90,000 Christians were killed for their beliefs worldwide last year and nearly a third were at the hands of Islamic extremists like ISIS. Others were killed by state and non-state persecution, including in places like North Korea.

“U.S. policy has not had a strategy for specifically addressing the persecution of Christians,” Ryan Mauro, national security analyst for the Clarion Project, told FoxNews.com “For example, very few people are even aware that Iraqi Christians began organizing to defend themselves and needed our help.""

The study also found that as many as 600 million Christians were prevented from practicing their faith in 2016.

The findings continue a disturbing trend from the previous year in which Christians around the world endured horrific acts of persecution, including imprisonment and beheadings.

“These numbers underscore what we already know,"" Robert Nicholson of the Philos Project said to Foxnews.com.""There are many places on earth where being a Christian is the most dangerous thing you can be.

""Those who think of Christianity as a religion of the powerful need to see that in many places it’s a religion of the powerless. And the powerless deserve to be protected.”

While the situation is most dire in the Middle East, Christianity is under assault in Africa and Asia, too, according to an Aid to the Church in Need study of incidents in 2015. It cited persecution at the hands of Islamist terror groups such as Boko Haram in Nigeria and other extremists in Sudan, Kenya, Tanzania and other parts of the continent.

Asia's Christians have been targeted by nationalist religious movements -- Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist -- in such countries as Pakistan, India and Myanmar. Many of these groups increasingly view Christianity as a foreign, ""colonial"" import, and believe its practitioners are doing the bidding of the West, say experts.

While Christians continue to be under siege from ISIS radicals in Syria and Iraq, the religion is being targeted throughout the region with members of the faith also under increasing pressure in Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations.

The Christian population in Iraq alone has plummeted from 1.5 million in 2003 to current estimates of 275,000 and could be gone for good within just a few years, according to activists. The dwindling numbers are due to genocide, refugees fleeing to other countries, those who are internally displaced, and others hiding in plain sight and not allowing their faith to be publicly known.

Despite these issues, experts like Mauro say that the faith has continued to flourish despite growing opposition.

“The persecution of Christians has failed to suppress the faith,” he said to FoxNews.com. “On the contrary, Christianity appears to be rapidly growing beneath the surface. Persecution will increase as Islamists see Christianity as an increasing problem for them.”

10,Trump fires back after Obama claims credit for economic boom: 'Con job',"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']","President Trump fired back Monday after former President Barack Obama, in a subtle swipe at the commander in chief, claimed credit for the economic gains in both their terms.

Obama tweeted Monday morning to note the anniversary of his signing the 2009 economic stimulus package.

“Eleven years ago today, near the bottom of the worst recession in generations, I signed the Recovery Act, paving the way for more than a decade of economic growth and the longest streak of job creation in American history,” Obama tweeted, alongside a photo of his signature on the bill.

But, the Trump campaign, in a statement to Fox News, countered that the economy was recovering only because of the actions Trump took to undo his predecessor's policies.

“President Trump reversed every single failed Obama-era economic policy, and with it, reversed the floundering Obama/Biden economy,” Trump campaign national press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said. “Obama and Biden orchestrated the worst economic recovery in modern history.”

She added: “By contrast, though, deregulating, lowering taxes, and supporting free-market policies, President Trump has created the hottest economy on record, with unemployment hitting generational lows and all-time lows for African Americans, Hispanics, the disabled, veterans and many other hard-working Americans.”

“Paychecks are growing at the fastest pace in a decade and twice as fast for low- and middle-income Americans,” she continued. “It’s no wonder Democrats seek to take credit for the Trump economy after eight years of betraying blue-collar workers and inflicting pain upon the middle class as Americans everywhere suffered. But the failed days of Democrat stagnation are over, and the soaring Trump economy is here to stay.”

Trump tweeted Monday night: “Did you hear the latest con job? President Obama is now trying to take credit for the Economic Boom taking place under the Trump Administration. He had the WEAKEST recovery since the Great Depression, despite Zero Fed Rate & MASSIVE quantitative easing. NOW, best jobs numbers ever. Had to rebuild our military, which was totally depleted. Fed Rate UP, taxes and regulations WAY DOWN. If Dems won in 2016, the USA would be in big economic (Depression?) & military trouble right now. THE BEST IS YET TO COME. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!”

Obama and his allies have long touted the impact of the $787 billion economic stimulus package, also known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The measure was passed and signed in February 2009 — about 14 months after the recession began in December 2007 and about eight months before the national unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent in October 2009.

TRUMP ECONOMY, THREE YEARS IN: WHAT THE NUMBERS SAY

The stimulus package was controversial at the time considering the size and scope of it, and its impact remains a matter of dispute. Obama officials, though, routinely credited the legislation with helping set the economy back on track following the historic recession, and claim it established the groundwork for economic gains under Trump.

Under the Obama administration, the unemployment rate fell steadily after reaching a high of 10 percent early in his first term, but it has continued to fall under Trump. The unemployment rate is currently at the lowest it's been in the last 50 years.

Meanwhile, the stock market has surged under Trump. According to a Fox Business analysis, the stock market grew 31 percent in the 807 trading days before Trump's election, but grew by 56 percent in the 807 trading days after it, up through the third anniversary of Trump's inauguration this January.

Also under the Trump administration, workers' wages rose, but according to the Fox Business analysis, had been rising slightly faster prior to Trump's first term.

His Email Is Frank.Miles Foxnews.Com.']","Ryan Newman has endured many terrifying crashes over his 20-year NASCAR career.

His ghastly crash on the final lap of the Daytona 500 on Monday night caused the sport to pause.

The 42-year-old Newman slid across the finish line in a crumpled heap of metal, sparks flying as his car skidded to a halt with fuel pouring onto the track frighteningly close to open flames.

Viewers gasped as track workers placed large black screens around his car and worked to get him out. They had to wait two excruciating hours to finally exhale.

DENNY HAMLIN WINS THIRD DAYTONA 500; RYAN NEWMAN HOSPITALIZED IN FIERY WRECK AT FINISH

It took two long hours before NASCAR announced Newman had non-life threatening injuries and was in serious condition at nearby Halifax Medical Center.

Tuesday afternoon, it was announced via Twitter that Newman was awake and speaking to his doctors and family.

Roush Fenway Racing President Steve Newmark released an updated statement Tuesday morning via Twitter saying Newman, who was racing for the organization, is still hospitalized.

“On behalf of Roush Fenway Racing and Ryan Newman’s family, we’d like to thank the NASCAR community for the incredible outpouring of support and compassion for Ryan. Your thoughts and prayers have comforted us all,” Newmark said. “Ryan remains at Halifax Medical Center and we will provide further updates on his condition as they become available.”

Safety crews rushed to Newman’s No. 6 Ford and worked to get the “Rocketman” out of his seat. The car was on fire as it skidded to a stop and had to be turned onto its tires before he could be unstrapped.

Ryan Blaney, who locked bumpers with Newman and turned him sideways, sounded crestfallen afterward. Corey LaJoie, who slammed into Newman’s sideways car at full speed, watched a replay and insisted he had no way to avoid the contact.

Newman’s wreck looked just as awful to the naked eye and arguably worse on replay.

Blaney turned him hard right and into the outside wall. His car immediately flipped and was sliding on its side when LaJoie rammed into it.

Denny Hamlin won the race for Joe Gibbs Racing, his second straight victory in the season opener and third in the last five years.

Breathtaking crashes are common at Daytona International Speedway, where drivers racing for position at 200 mph and in tight quarters often make contact. There have been no fatalities at the track since Dale Earnhardt’s death following a crash on the final lap of the 2001 Daytona 500.

NASCAR responded by beefing up safety regulations, mandating head-and-neck restraints and improving the design and development of the cars.

Newman, an Indiana native who graduated with an engineering degree from Purdue, said earlier during Speedweeks he felt renewed in his second year at Roush Fenway Racing and had stopped thinking about retirement.

12,"Rod Blagojevich, freed by Trump pardon, leaves Colorado prison, returns to Illinois",['Brie Stimson'],"After leaving prison Tuesday, former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich expressed his “everlasting gratitude” to President Trump who commuted his 14-year corruption sentence.

Blagojevich, who served eight years behind bars in Colorado, jokingly called himself a “Trumpocrat,” saying the president “saw a wrong and corrected it.""

Trump said the punishment imposed on the Chicago Democrat and one-time contestant on Trump's reality TV show ""Celebrity Apprentice"" was excessive. “So he'll be able to go back home with his family,” he said. “That was a tremendously powerful, ridiculous sentence in my opinion and in the opinion of many others.”

Blagojevich was convicted in his second trial in 2011 on 18 counts, including trying to sell former President Obama’s former Senate seat. His first trial ended with the jury unable to reach a verdict, except for a single conviction, for lying to the FBI.

TRUMP PARDONED, COMMUTED SENTENCES FOR THESE PEOPLE: THE FULL LIST

“I've got this thing and it's f------ golden. And I'm just not giving it up for f------ nothing,” Blagojevich said about Obama’s seat on an infamous wiretap.

“I didn’t do the things they said I did and they lied on me,” Blagojevich told Chicago's WGN-TV as he walked through O'Hare airport shaking the hands of travelers who welcomed him home.

As he exited the airport doors he was rushed by media and supporters, signing a few autographs before getting into a white SUV and speeding out of the airport toward his Ravenswood home. There he was rushed through a crowd of journalists and supporters to his front door. He said he was happy to be home with his wife and children before disappearing into the house.

Blagojevich said he would have more to say in a Wednesday news conference.

Trump expressed some sympathy for Blagojevich when he appeared on ""Celebrity Apprentice"" in 2010, before his first corruption trial started. When Trump ""fired"" Blagojevich as a contestant, he praised him for how he was fighting his criminal case, telling him, “You have a hell of a lot of guts.”

Blagojevich testified during his trial, calling himself a flawed dreamer grounded in his parents' working-class values. He said the hours of FBI recordings were the ramblings of a politician who liked to think out loud.

After he was released, the former governor said he learned how unfair the criminal justice system can be during his time in prison, especially for people of color. He also said he was drawn closer to God. “There is divine intervention in all of this,"" he told reporters.

""I'm going to fight against the corrupt criminal justice system that all too often persecutes and prosecutes people who did nothing wrong, who over-sentences people, show no mercy, and who are in positions who have no accountability,"" Blagojevich said. “They can do whatever they want. They can put you into prison for things that aren't crimes.”

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker rebuked the president's commutation in a statement.

TRUMP'S COMMUTATION OF BLAGOJEVICH SENTENCE SPARKS ANGER FROM ILLINOIS HOUSE REPUBLICAN LEADER

Trump “has abused his pardon power in inexplicable ways to reward his friends and condone corruption, and I deeply believe this pardon sends the wrong message at the wrong time,” he said.

Chairman of the Illinois GOP, Tim Schneider, agreed. “In a state where corrupt, machine-style politics is still all too common, it's important that those found guilty serve their prison sentence in its entirety,"" he said.

Trump made clear that he saw similarities between efforts to investigate his own conduct and those who took down Blagojevich.

“It was a prosecution by the same people — Comey, Fitzpatrick, the same group,"" Trump said. He was referring to Patrick Fitzgerald, the former U.S. attorney who prosecuted Blagojevich and now represents former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired from the agency in May 2017.

He entered prison in March 2012.

Blagojevich became the first Illinois governor to be removed by lawmakers in a nearly unanimous vote after he was impeached in 2009.

In 2015, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago tossed out five of his convictions, including ones in which he offered to appoint someone to a high-paying job in the Senate.

MICHAEL MILKEN, 'JUNK BOND KING,' AMONG NUMEROUS TRUMP PARDONS

A joint statement from the lead prosecutors at Blagojevich's trial, none of whom work in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Chicago anymore, stopped short of criticizing Trump's decision. But they highlighted the convictions, including trying to shake down a children's hospital, saying, “Mr. Blagojevich remains a felon.""

13,Rod Blagojevich’s sentence commuted: What to know about former Illinois governor’s case,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']","President Trump on Tuesday announced he is commuting the prison sentence of former Democratic Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who was convicted for attempting to sell Barack Obama’s vacant Senate seat when he was elected president.

The president has been considering a commutation for Blagojevich since May 2018.

TRUMP TO COMMUTE SENTENCE OF ROD BLAGOJEVICH

Here’s what to know about the former governor’s case:

Blagojevich, who was a contestant on Trump’s “Celebrity Apprentice” in 2010, began his 14-year prison sentence in 2012, after being convicted of corruption. Blagojevich’s scheduled release, prior to Trump’s planned intervention, is in 2024. Blagojevich has been serving his sentence at a federal prison in Littleton, Colo.

Blagojevich, who was governor of Illinois from 2003 to 2009, was impeached and convicted on corruption charges over allegations that he took bribes for political appointments – including to the open U.S. Senate seat vacated by Obama.

He has consistently argued he did nothing wrong.

TRUMP SAYS HE'S CONSIDERING PARDONING MARTHA STEWART, ROD BLAGOJEVICH

Trump first floated the idea of commuting Blagojevich’s sentence in May 2018, after pardoning conservative filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza. At the time, Trump called Blagojevich’s sentence “really unfair.”

Trump again raised the topic in August, noting that the White House was looking into whether or not a commutation for Blagojevich was possible.

“Rod Blagojevich, the former Governor of Illinois, was sentenced to 14 years in prison. He has served 7 years. Many people have asked that I study the possibility of commuting his sentence in that it was a very severe one,” Trump tweeted in August. “White House staff is continuing the review of this matter.""

A Nationally Syndicated Talk Host', 'Whose Program', 'The Leslie Marshall Show', 'Can Be Heard On Radio', 'Stream', 'Tune In', 'The Progressive Voices Radio Network']","When six Democratic presidential candidates meet for a televised debate Wednesday night in Las Vegas – joined for the first time by former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg – each will face his or her own set of challenges and vulnerabilities.

Bloomberg – with a fortune estimated at over $60 billion – is spending hundreds of millions of dollars of his own money on ads and staff across the nation. He has become one of the top competitors despite not being on the ballot in the first four nominating contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, and despite entering the presidential race late.

In addition to Wednesday’s debate in Las Vegas, Bloomberg has qualified to participate in another debate Tuesday in South Carolina, thanks to his strong showing in the polls.

'SOCIALIST' SEEN AS MOST UNPOPULAR QUALITY IN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, POLL FINDS

According to a Wall Street Journal-NBC News national poll published Tuesday night, the candidate drawing the most support from likely Democratic primary and caucus voters is Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont with 27 percent.

Sanders is followed by former Vice President Joe Biden with 15 percent; Bloomberg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts with 14 percent; former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg with 12 percent; and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota with 7 percent.

Because of the margin of error in the poll, Biden, Bloomberg, Warren and Buttigieg are bunched up in what amounts to a statistical tie for second place.

In the debate Wednesday night, we can expect the gloves will come off as candidates attack each other to fight for their breakthrough moments.

Bloomberg will no doubt get plenty of attacks as a billionaire spending record amounts to buy his way to the White House.

Warren previewed this line of attack Tuesday when she tweeted: “It’s a shame Mike Bloomberg can buy his way into the debate. But at least now primary voters curious about how each candidate will take on Donald Trump can get a live demonstration of how we each take on an egomaniac billionaire.”

And as the leader in polls, Sanders is sure to be attacked for being too far left to win a general election. He proudly calls himself a democratic socialist, but many voters tell pollsters they won’t support a socialist for president.

So what does each of these candidates have to do in the Wednesday night debate? What should each prepare for?

Mike Bloomberg

Bloomberg is focusing much of his campaign against President Trump, as if he is already the Democratic presidential nominee. In the battle to become the nominee, the former New York City mayor is contrasting himself to Sanders, positioning himself as a moderate with virtually unlimited funds who is better able than the socialist senator to defeat Trump in November.

Bloomberg is going to have to respond Wednesday night to the criticism by his fellow candidates that he is using his enormous wealth to buy the presidency with a massive nationwide advertising campaign.

The billionaire businessman and former mayor is also going to have to once again explain his support for the stop-and-frisk police tactic, which disproportionately impacted black and Latino men in New York City. He has already apologized several times in recent weeks for the anti-crime initiative, saying he did not realize years ago how harmful and racially discriminatory aspects of stop-and-frisk were.

Bloomberg will also have to fend off attacks accusing him of making racist comments and profane and sexist comments to and about women.

Nevertheless, the debate will give Bloomberg the chance to stand alongside the other major Democratic presidential candidates and speak for more than the few seconds of a TV ad.

Joe Biden

The former vice president needs to win the Nevada caucuses Saturday, or at least come in second. He also needs to win the South Carolina primary a week later to make up for his poor showing in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary.

To achieve these goals Biden needs a strong debate performance Wednesday night, with a breakout moment.

Biden, who has long enjoyed strong support among the African-American community, needs to attack Bloomberg for the former mayor’s record on race, particularly since polls show Bloomberg is gaining increasing black support, including endorsements from black elected officials.

Biden has said he is the Democrat with the greatest chance of defeating Trump in November. But that label won’t stick if he continues to run poorly in caucuses and primaries.

As a result, Biden will be fighting for his political life in the Nevada and South Carolina debates. The former vice president’s standing in national polls has ticked lower as Bloomberg has risen in the polls.

Bernie Sanders

Polls indicate Sanders has more support among Democrats in Nevada – about 25 percent – than any of his competitors. He is gaining increasing popularity among Latino voters on a national level as well as in Nevada.

Sanders needs to alleviate the fears of many Democrats that he will split the Democratic Party. Although he has stated he would support whomever the Democratic nominee is, many people don’t believe him, recalling the bitter campaign between him and Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination four years ago.

The failure of some Sanders supporters to vote for Clinton in the general election helped elect Trump as president.

Sanders should expect to be attacked Wednesday night for being a self-described democratic socialist, and face accusations that he is supporting unaffordable, impractical and ineffective solutions to the problems facing the nation today.

It’s also possible that someone will bring up the 78-year-old senator’s health, particularly since he suffered a heart attack recently on the campaign trail. Is he physically up to the high-pressure job of being president? He should be prepared to respond.

Pete Buttigieg

The 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Ind., did very well in both Iowa and New Hampshire – two states with an overwhelming majority of white voters.

Nevada and South Carolina will show what Buttigieg can do in states with large Latino and black populations that more accurately reflect the demographics of the nation and the Democratic Party.

So far Buttigieg has been unable to answer for shortcomings in his dealings with the black community when he was mayor of South Bend. He needs to do a better job Wednesday night.

The former mayor also needs to deal with criticism that he is too young and inexperienced to go from being mayor of a small city to the White House without any experience in national or even state government. Of course, Trump had no government experience when he was elected either.

Amy Klobuchar

Klobuchar hit it out of the park at the last debate in New Hampshire, delivering by far the best performance among the Democrats on stage. That stellar performance led to more money and more support among voters.

But voters are fickle. They’re looking for a leader and someone who can beat Trump.

Like Buttigieg, Klobuchar needs to improve her standing among African-American and Latino voters. And she needs to be prepared to answer for the fact that she has voted with Trump in Congress more than any other Democrat on the stage. Saying she’s truly bipartisan isn’t going to cut it with the Democratic voters.

Elizabeth Warren

Warren is the “I’ve got a plan for that” candidate. But what she doesn’t seem to have a plan for winning nominating contests, as we saw with her poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, a state that borders her home state of Massachusetts.

CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER

Warren typically does very well and is quite strong at the debates, but she needs to be able to turn a strong debate performance in strong showings in Nevada and South Carolina.

The senator from Massachusetts might come under attack for her proposed wealth tax by Bloomberg, who is one of the richest people in the world. Even many voters who believe the rich should pay higher taxes believe the wealth tax goes too far.

Warren also needs to explain how her positions differ from socialist Sanders on the far left and the other more moderate candidates to her right, and show why her positions deserve voter support.

15,"Arnon Mishkin: At Democratic debate in Las Vegas, expect a battle between Bloomberg and other candidates","['Arnon Mishkin', 'Arnon Mishkin Is Director Of The Fox News Decision Desk.']","Riding a wave of several hundred million dollars worth of advertising – and despite the onslaught of negative information about his opinions on race, stop-and-frisk, and his past support for Republicans – former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg has climbed to second place in some recent national polling of Democratic presidential candidates.

As a result, Bloomberg won a place on stage at Wednesday night’s Democratic presidential candidate debate in Las Vegas.

But though he was the last candidate invited, Bloomberg is certain to be the center of attention. Indeed, the only prediction I’m confident to make is that the TV ratings for the Las Vegas debate will be significantly higher than other recent Democratic debates.

BERNIE SANDERS SLAMS BLOOMBERG AT LAS VEGAS TOWN HALL, SAYS BILLIONAIRE TRYING 'TO BUY THIS ELECTION'

Not just political reporters, but audiences anticipate some kind of cage match between successful entrepreneur Bloomberg, self-described democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and analytic advocate for structural change Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

The question of the night will be: Who gets the better of the battle between Bloomberg, Sanders and Warren? And after the debate, do any candidates cast themselves as providing the only chance for the party to unite?

We’ve seen the likely battle lines already. After a tape emerged showing Bloomberg saying that the elimination of redlining (which made it easier for minority borrowers to qualify for mortgages) was at the heart of the 2008 fiscal crisis, Warren surfaced a 2005 video of herself cautioning that growing income inequality (which was not as big an issue then) was likely going to result in an enormous growth of mortgage defaults (that is, the fiscal crisis).

That’s Warren. Sanders doesn’t need a briefing book to know how to fit an attack on Bloomberg into his well-articulated stump speech about millionaires and billionaires having too much control of the U.S. political system.

The opportunity for both Sanders and Warren at the debate will be that they just need to attack Bloomberg. An effective attack may help the currently flailing Warren recapture some of the magic she had last fall, when she appeared as the Democratic front-runner and liberal darling of the party. She’s since basically been eclipsed (again) by Sanders.

With Warren flailing, Sanders essentially owns the left wing of the party – and it shows in the polling. In the most recent polls, Sanders is far ahead of his opponents.

With the more moderate wing of the party divided among former Vice President Joe Biden, Bloomberg, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Sanders just needs to maintain his strength (and his fairly high favorability, even among Democratic voters who aren’t for him). He can do that by simply attacking Bloomberg.

Bloomberg’s challenge is vastly more complicated. First, he needs to be able to respond to the anticipated attacks from the left, while also ensuring that he’s not shunted off and painted as the conservative in the race. Conservatives don’t win the Democratic presidential nomination, but moderates and sometimes liberals do.

But unlike folks who can wave off criticism – like Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Donald Trump have been able to – Bloomberg so far has shown about as much charisma as a Saltine cracker.

The one place where Bloomberg has excelled is in his ability to take the fight to Trump. Part of this stems from the massive ad campaign he’s running. Some have complained that he’s basically running a general election campaign – but I’d argue that that’s Bloomberg’s claim to the nomination.

The one thing that unites the entire Democratic Party – from the “Bernie Bros” to the “Never Trump” Republicans who are planning to vote Democratic – is a deep hatred of the current incumbent. Bloomberg’s message is that he’ll spend as much as several billion dollars making that case until November: “Mike Can Do It.”

If Bloomberg comes out of the debate unscathed by the attacks from the left – and maintains a more moderate persona focused on beating Trump – then he’ll have had a successful night. He will then be able to use his fortune to eclipse the other moderate candidates seeking the Democratic presidential nomination.

Sanders needs to make the case – without offending the more moderate parts of the Democratic Party – that only his proposed solutions have a chance to address the issues of climate change and income inequality that Democrats care about.

If the senator from Vermont can do this he will continue to maintain the support of his base, and possibly make inroads among the moderates who are beginning to think he may have an insurmountable lead.

The big question for me is whether the fight between Sanders, Warren and Bloomberg provides a slight opportunity for one of the three remaining non-billionaire moderates – Biden, Buttigieg, or Klobuchar.

CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER

All of them – especially Biden – have been campaigning on a claim that their moderate positions can better unite the party for November. But the results of Iowa and New Hampshire – and the likely results in Nevada on Saturday – suggest the voters have not yet agreed.

I still believe that the best chance for the Democrats is a “Plain Beige” candidate who focuses the entire campaign as a referendum on Trump, and doesn’t call attention to himself or herself as much.

Plain Beige may have a chance to make that case in an opening enabled by a Bloomberg-Warren-Sanders cage fight: A simple version of “we don’t need to choose between these two extremes.”

But in order for that to happen, Plain Beige needs to win a few primaries.

When host Martha MacCallum pressed the Senator on his startling and unverified claim, Cotton cited a study published by Chinese scientists in The Lancet, which he called a ""respected international science journal.""

""I'm suggesting we need to be open to all possibilities and we need to demand that China open up and be transparent so a team of international experts can figure out exactly where this virus originated,"" Cotton said.

We don't know because the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) won't open up to international experts,"" Cotton said. ""That's what we need to do so they can get to the bottom of where the virus originated and hopefully can effect a diagnostic test and vaccine for it.""

Cotton also pushed back against critics, specifically Rutgers University chemical biology professor Richard Ebright, who said he found no indication in the genome sequence of the virus to indicate it was engineered.

""Let's take the professor,"" Cotton said. ""He was ...in fact today cited in the Asia Times saying that it was quite possible that it was a laboratory incident.""

""That's not saying this is a bioweapon,"" Cotton clarified, ""but we do know they were investigating and researching coronavirus in that laboratory. It could've been an accidental breach, it could've been a worker that was infected.""

""My point is that we don’t know,"" Cotton said, adding that ""until we get all the evidence from the Chinese Communist Party, it is only responsible, not irresponsible, to keep an open mind about the hypotheses.""

Cotton also mentioned reports earlier Tuesday that the State Department has designated five Chinese media outlets as “foreign missions,” calling them, in essence, state-sponsored propaganda agents of the CCP.

MacCallum told Cotton that the State Department's designation ""does go to the point that you are making that the information we are getting is very difficult to verify,"" but Cotton turned his focus to The Washington Post and The New York Times, which have both published articles criticizing Cotton since his initial remarks and claimed he suggested the virus was the result of a Chinese bioweapon.

The patient died on Jan. 27 after falling ill two weeks earlier and becoming increasingly breathless. Doctors bombarded him with various medications in attempts to save his life, including anti-infection treatment alfa-2b, AIDS medicines lopinavir and ritonavir and the antibiotic moxifloxacin to prevent secondary bacterial infection. He also received a steroid to treat inflamed lungs and “serious shortness of breath” and a lack of oxygen in his blood.

He reported traveling to Wuhan, China, where the COVID-19 outbreak began, from Jan. 8-12 and experienced initial symptoms of mild chills and a dry cough on Jan. 14, the first day of the illness.

His fever decreased as a result of the treatment, but his breathing worsened and his blood-oxygen levels plummeted as he reached his final day of life.

His heart stopped after experiencing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which occurs when fluid builds in the alveoli, the tiny elastic air sacs in the lungs that bring oxygen into the blood and expel carbon dioxide.

“The pathological features of COVID-19 greatly resemble those seen in SARS and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infection. In addition, the liver biopsy specimens of the patient with COVID-19 showed moderate microvascular steatosis and mild lobular and portal activity (figure 2C), indicating the injury could have been caused by either SARS-CoV-2 infection or drug-induced liver injury,” the new report published in The Lancet concluded.

The new case study provides insight into how the virus attacks the lungs of patients. Such analysis has been limited by “barely accessible autopsy or biopsy” data, the study’s authors said.

GROUP OF MIRAMAR CORONAVIRUS EVACUEES RELEASED FROM QUARANTINE

The new coronavirus, COVID-19, has infected more than 72,000 people and killed over 1,868, far larger numbers than those who suffered from the SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, or MERS, Middle East respiratory syndrome, two other coronavirus epidemics of the past two decades.

In late 2002, a coronavirus nicknamed SARS broke out in Southern China, causing severe pneumonia and rapidly spreading to other countries. SARS infected more than 8,000 and killed 774, before disappearing altogether after a number of public health measures. In 2012, a similar outbreak known as MERS began infecting people in Saudi Arabia. It still causes infections in a small number of people each year, and in total has caused around 2,500 infections and more than 850 deaths.

SARS and MERS came from animals, and this newest virus almost certainly did, too. The first people infected with the coronavirus visited or worked at a seafood market in the Chinese city of Wuhan.

""Just a few months ago, anti-gun Democrats in Virginia thought they could easily ram through a new ban on so-called assault weapons and high-capacity magazines,"" Ingraham said Tuesday night on ""The Ingraham Angle,"" ""and Gov. Ralph Northam was supporting this bill, of course, with a phony argument that rolling back the gun rights of law-abiding Virginians would make all Virginians safer.""

""But Northam wasn't ready for the pushback, was he?"" Ingraham said. ""The opposition made sure that their voices were gonna be heard -- and boy, were they heard.""

The bill backed by Gov. Ralph Northam would have banned the sale of assault-style weapons in Virginia. It failed on a committee vote Monday morning, setting back one of the biggest priorities for the newly minted Democrat-controlled government in the state.

Ingraham celebrated the victory in Virginia with lawmakers losing out on their anti-Second Amendment push and noted Bloomberg's involvement.

""It's important to note that this grassroots uprising was successful despite the millions that have been pumped into the Commonwealth from out-of-staters like Democrat presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg,"" Ingraham said. ""Through his group, Every Town for Gun Safety, he funneled 2.5 million into Virginia last year to elect anti-Second Amendment Democrats.""

""But it turns out there's still a lot of Jeffersonian spirit left in Virginia,"" Ingraham said. ""Their Second Amendment rights aren't for sale.""

""But Bloomberg and the rest of the anti-gun forces in America won't let this defeat stop them,"" Ingraham said.

21,Oklahoma catch-and-release law forces angler to let go of monstrous 157-lb. paddlefish,['Jack Durschlag'],"For angler Justin Hamlin, it’s the tale of the big fish that got away.

Fishing in Oklahoma’s Keystone Lake in the northeastern part of the state Friday, Hamlin caught a huge, 157-lb. paddlefish that might have shattered a world record if not for a state regulation, officials told the Tulsa World.



KAYAK FISHERMAN HOOKS 500-POUND MARLIN, RESULTS IN 6-HOUR BATTLE

His Valentine's Day monster catch was likely the biggest paddlefish ever caught, but will likely never appear in the record books because it was caught on a Friday, one of two days that the state's catch-and-release law applies, the newspaper reported.

The state regulation requires that fish caught Mondays and Fridays be released immediately.

Those same regulations say paddlefishers on other days may keep only one of the species in a day’s fishing, forcing them to stop as soon as one is kept.

The fish measured 60.5 inches from tail-to eye with a girth of 45.25 inches, the World reported.

Hamlin said in his Valentine's outing with his wife — in which they caught five other fish -- he was excited by the catch as the paddlefish fought him three times before he brought it in.

22,"Jussie Smollett hoax allegations spark powerful response from black, gay Republican",['Matt London'],"Iraq War veteran and political analyst Rob Smith had a powerful message for those rushing to defend former ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett after he was indicted by a grand jury on six counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly lying to police about his claims of a racist and homophobic attack against him in January 2019.

""When did it become such a great thing to be a victim? That's what I'm trying to figure out,"" said Smith on Fox Nation's ""Reality Check with David Webb.""

Smollett was originally charged last year with disorderly conduct for allegedly staging a hoax hate crime attack in the streets of Chicago said to involve two supporters of President Donald Trump.

The charges were dropped in March 2019 with little explanation, angering police officials and then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel. The 37-year-old actor is reportedly due to return to court on Feb. 24

""I've never seen myself as a victim. I've never portrayed that,"" continued Smith, who is also African-American and gay. ""But there's so many people out there who seem to find their identity in victimhood.""

""And the reason why I come out as a black, gay Republican is to tell people that all those labels don't exist,"" he continued. ""You can believe what you want to believe. And as a black person or gay person or anything else in America in 2020, nothing is stopping you. But this up here,"" he said pointing to his head, suggesting that intelligence is the most important factor for success.

Last week, daytime talk show co-host Amanda Seales appeared to praise Smollett, saying that it is irrelevant whether he lied or not.

""Even if it was a hoax, this is really happening all the time. And even if it was a hoax for the sake of bringing attention to this, then I’m like, that’s low-key noble,"" said Seales, ""I’m just at my wits end about us centering situations like this and wanting to make people have to pay.""

""What I would say to that is that hate crimes are very real,"" said Smith. ""People really are attacked for being gay, for being black, for being whatever, but a hoax like this hurts the real victims of hate crimes.""

Webb also asked Smith to react to a new viral video of a young African-American woman, inside a multicultural center at the University of Virginia, suggesting that white students should leave the space.

CNN, MSNBC VIRTUALLY IGNORE NEW JUSSIE SMOLLETT INDICTMENTS, ZERO PRIMETIME COVERAGE

""Frankly, there are just too many white people in here and this is a space for people of color [POC],"" said the unidentified woman in the video. ""So just be really cognizant of the space that you're taking up because it does make some of us POC uncomfortable when we see too many white people in here.""

""I watched that video and I remembered I used to be that. ... I wasn't that extreme,"" Smith said. ""I remember going through college and being an undergrad and you just get the sense that, 'Oh, we need to have spaces for black people.'""

""It does a disservice to these students because [not one of] these students are learning anything more than to be perpetual victims of racism,"" he concluded. ""I think back to the way that I saw the world -- when I saw the world like that young lady -- and it was it was hurting me. And when I saw myself as a victim that was not able to achieve I didn't see more for myself.""

23,"Faye Swetlik's cause of death was asphyxiation, neighbor abducted and killed her, investigators say","['Bradford Betz', 'Bradford Betz Is An Editor For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']","Faye Swetlik, the 6-year-old girl who was found dead last Thursday in Cayce, S.C., after disappearing from her front yard three days earlier, was killed by her neighbor who acted as the ""sole perpetrator,"" investigators said Tuesday.

Lexington County Coroner Margaret Fisher said the autopsy showed Swetlik's death was a homicide and the cause of her death was asphyxiation.

She also said Swetlik died just a few hours after the neighbor, 30-year-old Coty Taylor, abducted her. She later revealed that Taylor died by suicide.

""The loss of Faye, an innocent child, who was simply playing in her own yard... has been extremely difficult to all of us,"" Fisher said.

The girl's body turned up in a wooded area in her neighborhood. Officials have not released information about the condition of her body out of respect for her family.

The girl got off a school bus and was last seen playing in her front around on Feb. 10. More than 200 officers from multiple law enforcement agencies searched over three days for her, knocking on doors and setting up roadblocks to question people who came in and out of the neighborhood.

Cayce Department of Public Safety Director Byron Snellgrove said investigators found a child's polka-dot boot and a soup ladle filled with fresh dirt in Taylor's trash Thursday.

That evidence led them to find the girl's body in woods that had been searched previously. Within minutes of finding her body, investigators said they found Taylor dead inside his home.

Cayce Department of Public Safety Director Byron Snellgrove said the two cases were linked. Fisher later released Taylor's autopsy results to Fox News showing he died by suicide from an ""incised wound to the neck.""

The girl's disappearance shocked Cayce, a small city of about 13,000 in the suburbs of the state's capital city, Columbia. Several prayer vigils took place while she was missing and after her body was found.

24,DOJ pushes back at reports Barr considered quitting over Trump tweets,['Morgan Phillips'],"The Justice Department pushed back Tuesday night at multiple reports claiming Attorney General William Barr told people close to him he's considering stepping down over President Trump's tweets, days after Barr admitted that Trump's tweeting made it ""'impossible for me to do my job.""

""Addressing Beltway rumors: The Attorney General has no plans to resign,"" DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec tweeted.

Barr ""has his limits,"" one person familiar with Barr’s thinking told The Washington Post. Its report suggested that Barr wanted Trump to ""get the message"" to stop weighing in publicly in ongoing criminal cases. An administration official gave a similar admission on Barr to The Associated Press.

Barr, speaking to ABC News last week, also denied ever acting on improper influence from Trump or the White House. White House officials told the Post that the president had no plans to stop tweeting about Justice Department cases. He insisted he had a ""legal right"" to make his voice heard on criminal cases.

The White House did not immediately comment on the Tuesday night reports.

PROSECUTORS QUIT EN MASSE; TRUMP SAYS STONE CASE A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE

Trump tweeted Tuesday he's considering suing those involved in former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation and said his confidant Roger Stone deserved a new trial after being convicted of witness tampering, obstruction and lying to Congress during the Mueller probe. Hours later, a Justice Department official revealed prosecutors had filed a sealed motion in court arguing the opposite, and that they had Barr's approval to do so.

Last week, Trump, in a late-night tweet, criticized a federal prosecutor's earlier recommendation that that Stone should be sentenced to seven to nine years in prison. Soon afterward, DOJ leaders adjusted the sentencing recommendation downward, saying it was clearly excessive given Stone's obstruction-related offenses. All four prosecutors on the case stepped down within hours.

WILL THERE BE A NEW TRIAL? FOREPERSON OF ROGER STONE JURY REVEALED TO BE STAUNCH ANTI-TRUMP DEM ACTIVIST

Barr asserted his independence in the Justice Department's decision to intervene. ""I'm not going to be bullied or influenced by anybody... whether it's Congress, a newspaper editorial board, or the president.”

Over the weekend, more than 2,000 former department employees signed a public letter urging Barr to resign over his handling of the Stone case. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., came to Barr's defense on Tuesday. The top Republicans insisted Barr had the ""highest character and unquestionable integrity"" and Democrats' efforts to ""intimidate"" him would fail spectacularly.

Trump, too, assured reporters he stood behind his attorney general, despite the criticisms. ""I have total confidence in my attorney general,"" Trump told reporters earlier Tuesday. ""I do make his job harder. I do agree on that. ... We have a great attorney general and he's working very hard.""

Stone has been a friend and adviser to the president for decades and was a key figure in his 2016 campaign, working to discover damaging information about the Clinton campaign.

Following the Yankees' first full-squad workout this spring, Judge responded to comments made Friday by reigning National League MVP Cody Bellinger of the Dodgers, who accused Astros All-Star second baseman José Altuve of stealing the American League MVP Award from Judge in 2017, the network reported. Judge finished second in the voting.

Judge confirmed he deleted a social media post congratulating Altuve not long after learning about the result of the MLB investigation, which backed up statements made by Oakland Atheltics pitcher Mike Fiers, a former Astro, to The Athletic in November.



MLB’s investigation confirmed the Astros had cheated by using a camera-based, sign-stealing system during their 2017 World Series-winning regular season and playoffs, and during part of the 2018 regular season.

""I think I took it down right when, I think, the story broke out - right when, I think, Mike Fiers came out and stated that this is what was going on in '17. Once I heard that, I [was] just - just sick to my stomach to find out,"" Judge said. ""I had a lot of respect for those guys and what they did, especially what they did for the city of Houston and that whole organization.

Last week, Buttigieg penned an op-ed in a South Carolina newspaper ""The State"" promoting his ""Frederick Douglass Plan,"" which he describes is ""a comprehensive investment in the empowerment of Black America"" that was developed with the help of black activists and business leaders.

""That begins with entrepreneurship, and our campaign has proudly partnered with local businesses like Diane’s Kitchen in Chester, Atlantis Restaurant in Moncks Corner and the Fair Deal Grocery on Charleston’s Eastside,"" Buttigieg wrote.

However, according to ABC News, two of those businesses, Diane's Kitchen and Atlantis Restaurant, said they ""only remembered welcoming Buttigieg's campaign as customers, not forging any sort of partnership with the candidate.""

""I stand for what I stand for and I didn't say I had a partnership,"" Diane's Kitchen owner, Diane Cole, told ABC News.

The report then alleges that the Buttigieg campaign attempted to ""persuade"" Cole into changing her position so that ""it would more closely match the language Buttigieg used in his op-ed"" in multiple messages after ABC News asked the campaign about Cole's response.

""It sounds like you're saying that I am your business partner. I'm only going to accept that you all stopped in while you were campaigning in South Carolina and I welcomed you all,"" Cole told the campaign in one message.

In a response to Fox News, the Buttigieg campaign clarified that the ""partnerships"" that the candidate cited in the op-ed were in reference to the campaign events held at those establishments and that they did not equate to endorsements for his candidacy.

""Pete has put forward the most comprehensive plan for Black America, which includes investing in the growth of Black-owned businesses and supporting Black entrepreneurs. We're proud to live our values as a campaign by holding events and spending money at Black-owned businesses in South Carolina and across the country, something we will continue to do throughout the campaign,"" a Buttigieg campaign spokesperson told Fox News.

Buttigieg, who has continued to struggle to gain support among black voters in the polls, faced similar backlash last fall for using stock photos of minorities, including an image of woman from Kenya, to promote the ""Douglass Plan"" on his website.

The campaign also offered an apology for ""its use and the confusion it created.""

I just can't imagine that requires of you that you be anywhere near this president.""

""Do you think that it's impossible to be a Christian and support Trump?"" Burnett asked.

""I'm not going to tell other Christians how to be Christian,"" Buttigieg responded, ""but I will say I cannot find any compatibility between the way this president conducts himself and anything I find in Scripture.""

""I'm not going to tell other Christians how to be Christian, but I will say I cannot find any compatibility between the way this president conducts himself and anything I find in Scripture."" — Pete Buttigieg

He continued, ""Now, I guess that's my interpretation but I think that it's a lot of people's interpretation and that interpretation deserves a voice.""

Buttigieg, a former mayor of South Bend, Ind., has frequently discussed his faith on the campaign trail and similarly expressed conflicting messages.

Last May, Buttigieg said religion shouldn't be used as a political ""cudgel,"" but then immediately suggested God wouldn't be a Republican.

""You also spend a fair amount of time talking about your faith. Why?” NBC's Craig Melvin asked.

""It’s important to me,"" Buttigieg responded. ""I think it’s also important that we stop seeing religion used as a kind of cudgel, as if God belonged to a political party. If he did, I can’t imagine it would be the one that sent the current president into the White House.”",https://www.foxnews.com/media/backing-trump-lacks-compatibility-with-scripture-buttigieg-claims-after-saying-god-is-apolitical
32,"Ben Affleck calls Jennifer Garner divorce 'biggest regret of my life,' explains why he lied about back tattoo",['Nate Day'],"Ben Affleck is reflecting on his relationship with ex-wife Jennifer Garner.

The ""Argo"" star, 47, spoke to the New York Times, where he discussed what led to the decline of his 10-year marriage to Garner.

""People with compulsive behavior, and I am one, have this kind of basic discomfort all the time that they’re trying to make go away,” Affleck told the outlet. “You’re trying to make yourself feel better with eating or drinking or sex or gambling or shopping or whatever. But that ends up making your life worse. Then you do more of it to make that discomfort go away. Then the real pain starts. It becomes a vicious cycle you can’t break.""

He added: ""That’s at least what happened to me.”

Affleck then admitted that he ""drank relatively normally"" for most of his marriage, but in 2015 or 2016, as issues began to bubble up in the relationship, he began to drink more heavily, which ""created more marital problems."" Affleck, who has been to rehab several times, entered rehab again in 2018, which he spoke about in an Instagram post at the time.

In 2018, Affleck and Garner, also 47, divorced after a long separation.

PATTI STANGER CLAIMS SHE'S SEEN BEN AFFLECK 'A MILLION' TIMES ON DATING APP RAYA

“The biggest regret of my life is this divorce,” revealed Affleck, explaining that while he still feels guilt over the split, he's moved beyond the shame. “Shame is really toxic. There is no positive byproduct of shame. It’s just stewing in a toxic, hideous feeling of low self-worth and self-loathing.”

Despite feeling guilty about the ordeal, Affleck said that he tries not to dwell on the past.

“It’s not particularly healthy for me to obsess over the failures — the relapses — and beat myself up,” said the Oscar winner. “I have certainly made mistakes. I have certainly done things that I regret. But you’ve got to pick yourself up, learn from it, learn some more, try to move forward.”

In the interview, Affleck also dishes on his now-infamous back tattoo and why he initially lied about it being fake.

In 2015, a paparazzi photo captured Affleck with his ink, a colorful phoenix covering a large portion of his back, on full display.

However, in a 2016 interview with Extra, the actor claimed it was ""fake for a movie,"" but it is, in fact, real.

“I resented that somebody got a picture of it by spying on me,” explained Affleck to the Times. “It felt invasive. ... I could have said, ‘That’s none of your business.’ I guess I got a kick out of messing with ‘Extra.’ Is your tattoo real or not real? Of course, it’s real! No, I put a fake tattoo on my back and then hid it.”

33,'Super-frisk is their name': Black Guns Matter founder mocks potential Bloomberg-Clinton ticket,['Matt London'],"African-American gun rights activist Maj Toure mocked the prospect of a Michael Bloomberg-Hillary Clinton presidential ticket, saying that both Democrats have pursued policies that have been harmful to the black community.

""If they team up super-frisk is their name forever,"" joked Toure on Fox Nation's ""Deep Dive"" on Tuesday.

The remark was a reference to Bloomberg's support for the ""stop and frisk"" policing practice that rose in prominence in New York City and Hillary Clinton's labeling of some African-American youth as ""superpredators"" during a 1996 speech in New Hampshire.

Toure is the founder of Black Guns Matter, a gun-rights group that ""educates people in urban communities in all 50 states on their Second Amendment rights and responsibilities through firearms training and education,"" according to its website.

Now a newly resurfaced clip of Bloomberg discussing a multimillion-dollar initiative to help young men has raised new concerns about his approach to minority communities.

In the 2011 clip, Bloomberg said, ""There's this enormous cohort of black and Latino males age, let's say 16 to 25, that don't have jobs, don't have any prospects, don't know how to find jobs, don't know what their skill sets are, don't know how to behave in the workplace.""

""What do you think when you see that?"" asked Wall Street Journal editorial page assistant editor James Freeman. ""You say his heart's in the right place and he's bad at expressing things, or you say this is not a good guy and he can't be president?""

""I think he's an elitist that has no attachment to the community,"" said Toure. ""He has this white savior complex like he wants to come tell all of the black and brown people that you guys don't know anything.""

""It's downright offensive,"" agreed former FBI terrorist task force member and adviser for the Trump 2020 campaign, Steve Rogers. ""Obviously, I'm white. I was offended by that. Why? Because I happen to know a lot of minority corporate executives, teachers, professors who contribute so much to this country.""

""I know what he was getting at because I saw him put this stuff into effect,"" said Mark Glaze, who is a former Bloomberg aide and executive director of Everytown for Gun Safety, which Bloomberg founded and chairs.

""There is an absence of programs that will allow folks who are in that so-called 'cohort' to actually get into the economy, stay there and keep moving up, which is why he did things like start the Young Men's Initiative in New York City that later became a model for the Obama administration programs,"" argued Glaze.

BLOOMBERG EXPECTED TO TAKE INCOMING FIRE AT DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE IN LAS VEGAS

Freeman suggested that a new political ad from the Bloomberg campaign may be meant to ""counter"" the impression that Bloomberg harbors stereotypes against minorities.

The commercial showed Bloomberg announcing a strategy to address the wealth gap between white and black communities, called the Greenwood Initiative.

""The wealth gap is inextricably linked to the racial inequalities of the past,"" said Bloomberg in the ad, ""And I'm determined to make breaking that link a centerpiece of my presidency.""

""The reality is, when he was in a political position, he supported policies that he admitted disproportionately affected, negatively, black and brown people,"" said Toure in reaction to the video. 'We know how this goes in the 'hood, everybody says anything in an election cycle.""

Xochitl Hinojosa told Fox News the party would no longer be using the app that didn’t work in Iowa.

“I have confidence in the state party here,” she said from the spin room in Las Vegas where the Democratic candidates will debate Wednesday. “I have spent the last few days with them and I have seen firsthand that they do want to get this right.

“I think that running a caucus and running a contest is always difficult,” she said. “You need to make sure that you have the amount of volunteers that you do. And I think that the Nevada party is doing everything they can to implement. Lessons learned from Iowa.”

She said the party will look at the role of caucuses going forward because “there's no doubt that there were issues in Iowa and we can't have that happen again.”

She added that she’d spent the last few days with the Nevada state party and they are extremely excited about the turnout in the early vote, which she said brought out around 36,000 people by Tuesday, the last day of early voting.

""[W]hat you are doing is, you're outsourcing who is running the government to people who are not accountable to the voters,"" Morrisey said during an appearance on Fox News' ""The Ingraham Angle."" ""It's unacceptable on so many levels.""

There would be public and media outrage if a corporation like ExxonMobil decided to fund similar attorneys, but for the opposite reasons, Morrisey added.

""I'd like to take a moment just to point out, what would the other side think if the Republican attorneys general were to bring 25 lawyers in [who] were paid by ExxonMobil, and they report both to the attorney generals and they report to ExxonMobil? People would find that to be absolutely unacceptable because it's unethical.""

The Bloomberg arrangement, which currently pays the salaries of Special Assistant Attorneys General (SAAGs) in 10 Democratic AG offices, is drawing new scrutiny now that the 78-year-old media mogul and former New York City mayor is running for president.

The New York University School of Law's State Energy & Environmental Impact Center, which was started in 2017 with $5.6 million from Bloomberg's nonprofit, hires mid-career lawyers as ""research fellows"" before providing them to state AGs -- where they assist in pursuing ""progressive"" policy goals through the courts.

Republican Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill also says he is concerned about how Bloomberg Philanthropies, NYU and state AG offices are cooperating.

“What’s problematic is the arrangement through which a private organization or individual can promote an overtly political agenda by paying the salaries of government employees,"" he said.

According to its website, the NYU State Impact Center currently has attorneys placed in the AG offices for Washington, D.C.; Delaware; Connecticut; Illinois; Massachusetts; Maryland; Minnesota; New Mexico; New York; and Oregon. The attorney general running each of those offices is a Democrat.

Speaking with Laura Ingraham, Morrisey added that what Democrats like Bloomberg seek more than answering to the people is raw political power.

36,Rep. Warren Davidson: Our Founding Fathers would let bulk surveillance expire,['Warren Davidson'],"When our Founding Fathers established this American Republic, a wise group insisted that our Constitution include the Bill of Rights to ensure that the federal government they created could not infringe on the natural rights of Americans. The First and Second Amendments protect speech and the right to bear arms, respectively. After these essential freedoms, however, comes an amendment that most consider obsolete: the Third, which prohibits the federal government from quartering soldiers in Americans’ homes during peacetime.

On its face, Americans shouldn’t have to worry about the Third Amendment. The Founding Fathers’ ban on quartering addresses a problem we no longer encounter. But, considered in tandem with the Fourth Amendment— the right to keep private property and documents secure against illegal searches — a different picture emerges.

Taken together, the Third and Fourth Amendments dovetail to form a right to privacy as it applies to the home, your property, and your person. The government cannot take up residence in your home, and it cannot look through your private effects without a warrant.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS BOYCOTT INTEL HEARING, ACCUSE SCHIFF

Yet that’s exactly what the government has done. Technology developed for national security purposes has worked its way into phones, computers, and tablets, compromising not only the American right to privacy but also the sanctity of our homes.

In less than a month, Congress can make our Founding Fathers proud and reverse this invasive legal trend. Section 215 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) is set to expire on March 15. FISA was originally created in 1978 and massively expanded after 9/11 under the USA Patriot Act. The emphasis is on “foreign” -- there are supposed to be safeguards to protect American citizens from being targeted with these statutes. However, the U.S. government secretly has secretly taken up residence in Americans’ smartphones and laptops.

The scope of abuse from this troublesome law gained notoriety in 2013 when whistleblower Edward Snowden went public about the National Security Agency’s warrantless warehousing of millions of Americans’ phone records and geolocation data. Congress attempted to “fix” the obvious legal problems by passing the USA Freedom Act in 2015, but we know the story of abuse doesn’t end there.

In 2016, the FBI spied on a member of President Trump’s campaign staff, abusing the lax standards and selective enforcement mechanisms of FISA, using stories of “Russian meddling” in the general election to prop up Clinton-sourced opposition research linked to Russia.

Separately, an October 2018 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) found more widescale abuse. The FISC opinion was declassified on Oct. 8, 2019. Among other findings, it shows that the FBI made 3.1-million warrantless searches of Americans’ data in 2017 alone. Some 57,000 individuals were subject to illegal searches by the FBI in April 2018. The year before, the FBI searched over 70,000 email addresses and phone numbers. At no point did a court issue a warrant and these individuals were never notified that they were subject to such a search.

Worse, no one batted an eye after the FISA court made these abuses public -- despite the fact that such abuses strike at the very heart of our civil liberties and the spirit of our constitutional republic.

Fortunately, an unlikely group of legislators from both chambers in Congress has banded together to introduce legislation that will finally protect the 3rd and 4th Amendments and overhaul FISA.

In the House, I joined my colleagues Reps. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., Pramila Jayapal D-Wash., Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore. and Ted Yoho, R-Fla., to work with Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Steve Daines, R-Mont., to introduce the Safeguarding Americans’ Private Records Act (SAPRA).

This bipartisan legislation ends the National Security Agency's mass phone record program and prohibits warrantless searches of GPS, web browsing, and search engine history. It also makes the FISA court more accountable by requiring the court to notify American citizens if they’ve been investigated under FISA and forcing the court to disclose all opinions within six months of issuance.

SAPRA also creates public reporting requirements about the extent to which intelligence agencies illegally used FISA to surveil Americans or target activity protected under the First Amendment.

My fellow cosponsors and I can only hope that as the evidence has piled on that more of our colleagues will support our bipartisan legislation. With the March 15 deadline approaching, we are in a unique position to correct this prior constitutional malpractice and systemic abuse.

For too long, Congress has allowed an overzealous intelligence community to operate with limited oversight in the name of national security. America can (and must) sustain the world’s preeminent intelligence capabilities without infringing on the rights of American citizens. SAPRA will help bring this era of congressional negligence to an end and usher in a newfound appreciation for the power and purpose of those oft-forgotten Third and Fourth Amendments.

37,Tucker Carlson: Bloomberg is trying to buy the presidency – he believes only his wealth matters,"['Tucker Carlson', 'Tucker Carlson Currently Serves As The Host Of Fox News Channel S', 'Fnc']","According to new numbers over the weekend, the Democratic primary race is constricting to become really a two-man contest. A lot of people are still in the race, but the outline of the future is getting clearer.

So on one side, you have a candidate, Bernie Sanders, who wants to turn this country into a comprehensive welfare state. He plans to upend every aspect of American life in order to impose a new economic order. Now Sanders isn't hiding what he plans to do; he is running on what he plans to do.

BLOOMBERG’S ‘MERCENARIES’: BILLIONAIRE DEM FUNDING NETWORK OF CLIMATE LAWYERS INSIDE STATE AG OFFICES

His main rival is Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York. Bloomberg has shot to above 15 percent nationally in the polls from nowhere essentially. He is suddenly leading the race in the critical Super Tuesday state of Florida.

So what is Mike Bloomberg running on? That's a trick question, actually. Bloomberg isn't running on anything. Not because he doesn't have ideas – he's got plenty of ideas, and some of them are far outside the American mainstream.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

But Bloomberg doesn't think any of that matters. He's not running on ideas. He's not trying to convince voters of anything. He's not making arguments or working to change their minds on policies they care about.

He is trying to buy them and hence, the presidency. It's the single most cynical political campaign ever run in this country. Bloomberg is trying to subvert our democracy with cash, and he is going all-in to do it.

According to the latest numbers, Bloomberg has spent more than $417 million on advertising so far in this race. His nearest rival, Bernie Sanders, has spent $40 million. That's less than a tenth.

Bloomberg can't be bothered with selling ideas or with a platform. He doesn't care what the public thinks, that's why. He believes he can win by overwhelming voters with his money.

Joe Biden, the man they told us was the front-runner, has spent just $12.3 million. Compare that, let's say it again, to the at least $417 million Bloomberg has pumped into the race just on advertising.

And that's just the beginning. Aides say Bloomberg is willing to spend $2 billion of his own money by Election Day and the number could go higher. Nothing like this has ever happened in America. Bloomberg's spending is like – and pick your metaphor here – a tsunami breaking over our political system. When the waters recede, there's nothing left. It's been flattened and wiped clean by the weight of Mike Bloomberg's wealth.

Bloomberg is the tallest figure on the landscape. The only one left upright. That's his plan. He has all but admitted that's his plan. Watch him disavow stop and frisk, the single most successful policy he had as mayor of New York.

Michael Bloomberg, 2020 presidential candidate: I defended it, looking back, for too long, because I didn't understand then the unintended pain it was causing to young black and brown families and their kids. I heard their pain, their confusion and their anger, and I've learned from them, and I've grown from them.

So think about what you just saw. It's not the normal pandering.

Mike Bloomberg believes passionately in gun control. It's his life's mission. It's his signature issue.

Stop and frisk may have been the most effective gun control policy ever administered anywhere. It took thousands of illegal firearms off the streets of New York, but Democratic primary voters have decided they don't like it. They're against stop and frisk. So without even pausing, Bloomberg grovels, as you just saw, and attacks his own legacy.

Why did he do that? Because he doesn't care. Whatever. They are only words. He'll do whatever it takes. Now, they say politicians are ethically flexible, and of course, they are. But this is different. There's something ominous about it.

Bloomberg can seamlessly change his core beliefs because he doesn't think his beliefs are relevant to the outcome of this race. Only his wealth matters.

And the horrifying fact is he may be right.

How wealthy is Michael Bloomberg? Well, for context, the richest of the fabled Russian oligarchs, Leonid Mikhelson, is worth about $24 billion. Michael Bloomberg could literally give away twice that amount or spend it on a presidential race, if he wanted, and still be five times as rich as Donald Trump is.

It's hard to imagine just how much money that is. But with that money, Bloomberg can suffocate all opposition and seize power. Our ruling class, which worships money above all, sees nothing wrong with this. They're eager to help Bloomberg do it. Like Bloomberg, they're religiously libertarian on economic matters.

That's a position that's shared by only a tiny percentage of the population. No normal person in this country thinks the widening wealth gap is a good thing. It's so obviously making America unstable. But Mike Bloomberg has been one of its chief beneficiaries. He will defend the current system above all else. There's a reason he is the favorite of finance moguls and tech connoisseurs.

Again, this is a total departure from anything we have seen before in the history of this country. Say what you will about Donald Trump, but in 2016, he ran for president on ideas that large numbers of voters actually liked, whether or not they liked him.

Secure the border, end counterproductive wars, fight the fascism of political correctness. In selling those ideas, he spent about half what Hillary Clinton spent. But Bloomberg can't be bothered with selling ideas or with a platform. He doesn't care what the public thinks, that's why. He believes he can win by overwhelming voters with his money.

This is the nightmare scenario that campaign finance reform activists used to tell us about. They were right about one thing: our system has been vulnerable to people like Michael Bloomberg for a long time. He is just the first one who's actually tried to do it. You should be alarmed by his campaign for president.

Democracy doesn't break when voters choose unwisely; they sometimes do. Democracy collapses when what voters want becomes irrelevant.

And while Ventura admitted her success didn’t come overnight, she was determined to make her mark and inspire other girls to step out of their shells.

Yovanna Ventura: Well, that's a funny story because I was not discovered like a regular model. I had to really fight to be able to become what I wanted. I had to knock a lot of doors and be neglected many times, but it was all worth it. It was all hard work. It took me to where I am today and now I am proudly signed with The Lions, which is an amazing agency and the team... believes in me. So yeah, it's not the regular story, but I am very proud of how I got to where I am.

I can feel lazy in the beginning. But once I’m there, I can’t stop. I really do love that feeling of being active and knowing I accomplished something. Lately, I’ve really been into boxing and kickboxing. I love hot yoga and regular gym routines when I don’t have the time to do those other activities. I feel like it really helps with my stress and anxiety. It just brings peace to my mind most of the time.

Fox News: You have over 5 million followers on Instagram. With such a large platform, how do you deal with trolls and negative comments?

Ventura: Well, it used to get to my head when I was a little younger, since I started getting followers when I was younger. But on this day, I don't really pay attention to any of that. I mostly pay attention to the positive comments, which, thank God, most of what I get on my comments are positive. So I always try to keep that in mind. There are way more positive comments out there than negative. And the negative comments probably don't come from people that are very happy. So I just try to be nice about it and not really pay it any mind.

Ventura: I try to be open with my followers with things that I know could motivate them, things that could help them... be better and do better in life. And then the things that don't really matter for me to show out there, I try to keep private. But I just try to stay connected with them with the things that really truly matter.

Fox News: As a model, what’s your secret to looking good in photos?

Ventura: When I have a shoot or something important coming up, I make sure that I eat healthy the day before. No dairy, nothing like that because it makes me wake up puffy or tired. I try to work out the day before, or the morning of, if I can. It helps get rid of puffiness or if I'm bloated or anything like that. Also, putting ice on my face in the morning helps a lot with puffiness.

Fox News: Was there ever a point in your career where you felt like giving up because things weren't going your way? What kept you going?

Ventura: There were definitely different points in my career where I felt like, ""What am I doing?"" I never felt like giving up, but I have had moments where I'm like, ""Is this really what I should be doing?"" I've gotten so many ""No's"" in my career. Should I keep pushing? And thankfully, I have really amazing people around me. I think that's very important — to have positive people, hardworking people that want the best for you around you.

And I have a really amazing manager, who never gives up on me and always pushes me. I have amazing friends that always push me, never let me get down or give up on anything. So I'm very grateful for the people that I do have around me. And also, as I said before, it's really important to me to be the face for the Latin industry in the fashion industry right now. I feel like it's really important for Hispanic girls and girls from Miami as well, where I was born, to have someone to look up to and know that they can do whatever they want with their lives.

Fox News: Who were some of your inspirations growing up?

Ventura: My main inspiration is JLo because she’s a very strong Latina. She came from nothing and pushed through. She really had to work to get to where she is. And every goal, everything that she said she would do, she did it and she did it amazingly. She never gave up. So [she’s] one of my biggest inspirations.

Fox News: You were originally a model for Kanye West’s Yeezy collection. What was that experience like?

Ventura: It was great. I actually got the call a day before the shoot so everything happened so fast. But I was so excited and the team was wonderful. Everything looked amazing. I loved the whole look they did. And [I met] Kanye. He was great, very hardworking. He was very into the shoot and very committed [to the creativity]. That didn't really surprise me because I know those people have to work really hard. But it was very refreshing to see that he is so involved with his work and the campaign and everything going behind the scenes.

Fox News: You’re all about raising awareness on the environment and animals.

Ventura: It’s true. Before I even got the followers or anything, I've always really loved doing volunteer work... I have this crazy love for animals. I recently started doing beach cleanups and I'm very proud of that. I really want to try to do, instead of a meet and greet, I wanted to do something that I could meet my followers, but also do something for them and for the planet. So I thought about the ocean cleanup and making that a meet and greet. That way we can all meet and do something for our community... Things like that really make me happy.

Fox News: What advice would you give to someone who wants to be more involved in helping their environment, but doesn't know where to begin?

Ventura: I think it's very easy. Little things, like not using plastic as much. Carry your water bottle everywhere with you instead. That's something I started doing recently too and it's so easy... That stops you from using so many plastic bottles.

Fox News: What are three fun facts our readers should know about you?

Ventura: Maybe something that people don't really know about me is that I do love to dance. I love to dance to my Latin music… I used to be super shy. I still am working on it and I fight through it. But... that's why I didn't get into the industry a lot sooner because I was extremely shy. I could not talk in front of people. So that's something really cool for me, that I have been able to push through all these fears and shyness and everything.

The new Bronco will be built alongside the Ranger in Michigan on a modified version of the pickup’s frame.

45,"70,000-year-old Neanderthal discovery shows they likely 'buried their dead with flowers'",['Chris Ciaccia'],"A shocking new study suggests that Neanderthals may have buried their dead with flowers.

The research looks at an ""articulated"" (all the bones in proper order) Neanderthal skeleton that was recently unearthed in Iraqi Kurdistan, the first such skeleton found in more than 20 years. Known as Shanidar Z, the Neanderthal was likely ""deliberately buried,"" according to experts. Clumps of ancient pollen were also found, suggesting that flowers were also a part of the burial ritual.

""So much research on how Neanderthals treated their dead has to involve returning to finds from sixty or even a hundred years ago, when archaeological techniques were more limited, and that only ever gets you so far,"" said the study's lead author, Emma Pomeroy, in a statement.

SOME OF OLDEST NEANDERTHAL BONES HAVE BEEN DNA TESTED SHOWING MORE THAN 70 DIFFERENCES

""To have primary evidence of such quality from this famous Neanderthal site will allow us to use modern technologies to explore everything from ancient DNA to long-held questions about Neanderthal ways of death, and whether they were similar to our own,"" Pomeroy added.

New analysis shows that Shanidar Z is believed to be more than 70,000-years-old and was likely a middle- or elderly-aged adult when he died.

The researchers started exploring the Shanidar Cave where the skeleton was found in 2014 but had to postpone digging for a year because of its close proximity to Islamic State forces.

After the dig was restarted, a rib, part of a spine and a clenched right hand were discovered. A crushed skull and the left hand were subsequently found years later.

""The new excavation suggests that some of these bodies were laid in a channel in the cave floor created by water, which had then been intentionally dug to make it deeper,"" Cambridge's McDonald Institute of Archaeology professor Graeme Barker added in the statement. ""There is strong early evidence that Shanidar Z was deliberately buried.""

The cave was first discovered in the 1950s by archaeologist Ralph Solecki (who died in 2019), who unearthed 10 skeletons of Neanderthal men, women and children, including one that had clumps of pollen surrounding it. However, for nearly 70 years, the idea that Neanderthals buried their dead with flowers was highly controversial, but the new findings add credence to Solecki's idea.

CLIMATE CHANGE DROVE SOME NEANDERTHALS TO CANNIBALISM

""In recent years we have seen increasing evidence that Neanderthals were more sophisticated than previously thought, from cave markings to use of decorative shells and raptor talons,"" Pomeroy explained. ""If Neanderthals were using Shanidar cave as a site of memory for the repeated ritual interment of their dead, it would suggest cultural complexity of a high order.""

The study has been published in the scientific journal Antiquity.

Researchers have unlocked several secrets about Neanderthals in recent memory. Earlier this month, scientists at Princeton University found Neanderthal DNA in African populations.

In January, experts looking at seashells fashioned into tools revealed that some Neanderthals had a much closer connection to the sea than was previously thought.

In September, then-14-year-old Sam Levitt fell ill with a sinus infection, experiencing “excruciating” headaches.

There, Sam was reportedly given different antibiotics and was sent home.

But two days later, the teen’s condition took a turn for the worse. He suffered a seizure and was rushed back to the children’s hospital where it was initially suspected he was suffering from meningitis, South West News Service (SWNS) reported.

An MRI quickly revealed, however, that Sam’s sinus infection had spread to his brain. His brain was swelling and he required a craniectomy to relieve the pressure.

""It was so scary waiting for him to come out of the operation. Those hours were the worst of our lives,” recalled Lis, adding Sam was in a medically-induced coma for two days following the operation.

""Luckily they had put his skull back together during the operation, but he was left with quite a scar,” she continued. ""We did not know what he was going to be like when he came round.""

Thankfully, Sam seemed to be his old self after waking. He was hospitalized for 12 days in total but was eventually allowed to return home after “being pumped with antibiotics” during the remainder of his stay.

It's believed the structures were built in the 17th century and used bones that were already more than 200 years old. Included in the walls are thigh and shin bones from adults and several skulls, which have been shattered.

The gruesome discovery was found at Saint-Bavo’s cathedral in Ghent, Belgium, which has been used for more than 1,000 years, The Sun reports.

It's likely that the walls of bones were built when the church's graveyard was cleared in an effort to create new graves, with De Gryse stating that ""skeletons cannot just be thrown away.""

""Given that the faithful believed in a resurrection of the body, the bones were considered the most important part,"" he explained. ""That is why stone houses were sometimes built against the walls of city graveyards: to house skulls and the long bones in what is called an ossuary.""

Several other disturbing gravesites in Europe have been unearthed in recent months.

In January, four mysterious warrior graves from the 11th-century were discovered in Poland. Earlier this month, more than 40 skeletons with their hands tied behind their backs were discovered at a construction site in the U.K.

Devin Nunes, R-Calif., who grew up raising cattle on his family's dairy farm, responded Tuesday to former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's comments about the alleged simplicity of farming.

Speaking with Sean Hannity from Tulare County, Calif., where agriculture is a vital part of the economy, Nunes said that Bloomberg is oversimplifying the work done by the economy's agricultural sector.

THREE FARMERS RESPOND TO MICHAEL BLOOMBERG

""This is the San Joaquin Valley. We're the breadbasket of the solar system, we like to say. Three hundred different crops grow here. And it takes a hell of a lot of experience to do it, generations of farmers. It's very scientific.""

""Mike Bloomberg seems to think that this is just like buying a Chia Pet at Walmart and turning some water on it,"" Nunes added. ""That's not how this works.""

In remarks at Oxford University's Saïd Business School in November of 2016, Bloomberg told an audience that he could ""teach anybody to be a farmer.""

""It's a process. You dig a hole, put a seed in, put dirt on top, add water, up comes the corn,"" he said flippantly.

Nunes said Tuesday that in addition to growing food, the agricultural industry plays a vital role in ensuring that produce makes it to grocers across the country, including in Bloomberg's home city.

""In coastal cities, housing has become astronomically expensive. Prices are rising far faster than wage growth. And most tragically, an opioid epidemic kills tens of thousands of Americans every year,"" Carlson said on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight."" ""One of the chief reasons for that is a synthetic opioid called fentanyl, which is smuggled in from abroad.""

""A single theme ties them together: A systematic decision, by many of our country’s most powerful leaders, to sell out this country to China,"" Carlson added.

The host warned that China ""is no longer simply an economic rival to the United States. It’s becoming a dangerous enemy.

""But instead of protecting us from this threat ... our leadership class collaborates with the other side. Why? Simple: they’re getting rich from it.""

The host began his list of example's with last year's controversy involving the NBA, which began when Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted a message of support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. Many league officials and prominent players sought to distance themselves from Morey in order to pacify Beijing.

Carlson then criticized lawmakers and former lawmakers for aligning themselves with China for a payday before moving on to America's universities.

""The entire sleazy academic world is addicted to Chinese money. Harvard and Yale both stand accused of hiding hundreds of millions of dollars in donations and payments from foreign countries,"" Carlson said. ""American academics have made it clear whose side they’re on.""

Camosy told host Tucker Carlson that the most common reason patients in Oregon, where assisted suicide has been legal since 1997, request access to PAS is not due to ""physical pain and suffering,"" -- as is often assumed -- but rather a fear of ""being a burden on others,"" and fear of ""losing one's autonomy.""

""I'm a college professor so I'm around progressives a lot,"" Camosy said. ""It's an absolutely bizarre reaction ... to say 'Well, there are these people who fear these things because of our socially unjust world, [so] let's make it easier for them to kill themselves.' That can't possibly be the correct response from somebody that cares about social justice.""

Carlson suggested to Camosy that it would only be a matter of time before companies ""figure out that it's a lot cheaper if you are dead than if you are, say, being treated for diabetes.""

Camosy agreed, noting that what he called the more ""vulnerable"" populations that seem the most skeptical of PAS.

""They get it,"" he said. ""They know that when you say things like, 'Who is a burden?' It's them. Who has lost their autonomy? It's them. There is a whole elitist substructure which says 'We're going to benefit from that now.' It's not explicit but they do in fact benefit from that.'""

MAINE IS 8TH STATE TO LEGALIZE ASSISTED SUICIDE

Camosy said his book ""Resisting the Throwaway Culture"" emphasizes the importance of speaking up on the issue, ""at least if we do care about vulnerable populations.""

Camosy also noted that Latinos and African-Americans specifically are ""on the front lines of this"" and have spoken out against PAS ""very disproportionately especially compared to privileged whites.""

""We hear about racial justice all the time ... how about being consistent and saying 'Let's listen to these voices of color here, not just on the set of issues that we happen to care about Monday through Friday,"" Camosy said.

54,Who is Judge Amy Berman Jackson?,"['David Aaro', 'Judge Jackson To Roger Stone', 'David Aaro Is A Reporter At Fox News Digital Based In New York City.']","Former Trump adviser Roger Stone is expected to be sentenced Thursday by U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who has been involved in several high-profile cases since being appointed to the federal bench in 2011 by former President Barack Obama.

In recent years the 65-year-old Baltimore native and Harvard Law School graduate has presided over cases involving Stone, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former Democratic U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. -- as well as one involving Hillary Clinton's Benghazi-related emails.

Jackson said Tuesday during a pre-sentence hearing that she will move ahead with the sentencing of Stone this week -- rejecting requests by the defense to delay or request a new trial.

JUDGE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH ROGER STONE SENTENCING AMID CONTROVERSY

She has been described by some as tough, fair and always prepared.

Here are more details about cases over which Judge Jackson has presided.

Roger Stone case

Jackson is presiding over the Roger Stone case, in which a jury found him guilty on all seven counts of obstruction, witness tampering and making false statements to Congress in connection with former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.

Stone was charged with providing false statements to the House Intelligence Committee about communication involving WikiLeaks, obstructing a congressional investigation of Russian interference during the 2016 U.S. presidential election and witness tampering.

During the trial, Jackson barred Stone from speaking publically about the ongoing prosecution after a picture of her appeared on his Instagram with what appeared to be crosshairs on the background.

Stone blamed the decision -- which he reviewed -- on an unnamed volunteer and apologized, to which Jackson replied last February, ""I have serious doubts about whether you learned anything at all.""

""From this moment on, the defendant may not speak publicly about this case -- period,"" Jackson said. ""No statements about the case on TV, radio, print reporters, or [the] internet. No posts on social media. [You] may not comment on the case through surrogates. You may send out emails about donating to the Roger Stone defense fund.""

""This is not baseball. There will be no third chance. If you cannot abide by this, I will be forced to change your surroundings so you have no temptations,"" she added.

""This is not baseball. There will be no third chance. If you cannot abide by this, I will be forced to change your surroundings so you have no temptations."" — Judge Jackson to Roger Stone

Ahead of Thursday's scheduled hearing, Jackson was attacked by President Trump in a Feb 11 tweet. He also criticized prosecutors' recommendation that Stone should face seven to nine years in prison.

""Is this the Judge that put Paul Manafort in SOLITARY CONFINEMENT, something that not even mobster Al Capone had to endure? How did she treat Crooked Hillary Clinton? Just asking!"" Trump wrote.

After his tweets, the Justice Department announced in a surprising decision it was revising the federal sentencing guidelines of term length. Several prosecutors quit and Trump was accused of interfering in the process, which he denied.

Fox News contributor Andrew McCarthy said Jackson can impose whatever sentence she feels is appropriate, regardless of how Trump or Attorney General Bill Barr feel about the case. But McCarthy wrote recently that ""the Stone prosecution is more politics than law enforcement. It was the Mueller probe’s last gasp at pretending there might be something to the Russia-collusion narrative.""

Paul Manafort case

Jackson sentenced former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to nearly seven years in prison last March in connection with his guilty plea related to foreign lobbying and witness tampering. She ordered a term of 73 months to be added to a 47-month sentence given earlier on bank and tax fraud charges in a separate case by Virginia Judge T.S. Ellis.

In December, Manafort's state mortgage fraud charges were dismissed citing double jeopardy laws.

“This defendant is not public enemy number one, but he is not a victim either,” Jackson said last March during Manafort's sentencing and prior to his charges being dismissed. “The question of whether there was any collusion with Russia ... was not presented in this case, period, therefore it was not resolved by this case.”

In 2018, Manafort agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, pleading guilty to two felony conspiracy charges in relation to his lobbying work with Ukraine.

Last February, Jackson ruled Manafort intentionally breached his guilty plea agreement by lying to investigators on Mueller's team.

PAUL MANAFORT'S STATE FRAUD CHARGES DISMISSED, NEW YORKK JUDGE CITES DOUBLE JEOPARDY

""The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) made its determination that the defendant made false statements and thereby breached the plea agreement in good faith,"" Jackson wrote. ""Therefore, the Office of Special Counsel is no longer bound by its obligations under the plea agreement, including its promise to support a reduction of the offense level in the calculation of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines for acceptance of responsibility.""

Jackson grilled Mueller's team during the probe on whether Manafort lied to investigators before her eventual ruling.

""So, I'm trying to figure out what the importance is of his ongoing work for a potential candidate in the Ukraine at that time is, and the importance of any lies about that, or lies about Konstantin Kilimnik's [who has ties to Russian intelligence] knowledge about that,"" Jackson said.

She appreciated Manafort's attendance in court last February after denying his attempt to skip the hearing due to what he described were health reasons.

""I believe it was very helpful, very useful and very important for you to have been here, Mr. Manafort,"" Jackson said. ""I know that we've had hearings where counsel sought to minimize the burden on you and not have you be here, but this is about you, it's not about them. And I think it's very important that they have you available to ask questions to.""

Jesse Jackson Jr. case

The judge sentenced former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. to 2-1/2 years in prison back in 2013 after he was convicted of spending $750,000 in campaign funds on personal items -- such as a gold watch, cigars and mounted elk heads.

Jessie Jackson Jr. is the son of civil rights leader the Rev. Jesse Jackson.

During the case, she said that if she had given him no prison time it would have suggested there was one system for the well-connected and one for everyone else.

FORMER REP. JESSE JACKSON JR. SENTENCED TO 30 MONTHS IN PRISON

""I cannot do it. I will not do it,"" she said, adding that as a public official, Jackson Jr. was expected to ""live up to a higher standard of ethics and integrity.""

Clinton Benghazi email case

Jackson tossed out a wrongful-death lawsuit against Hillary Clinton in 2017 by the parents of two Americans who were among those killed in a terror attack against a diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. The lawsuit alleged that Clinton's use of the private email server caused their deaths.

WHAT HAPPENED DURING AND AFTER THE BENGHAZI ATTACK IN 2012

The ruling was based on the Westfall Act, which gives federal employees immunity from tort claims arising out of acts made during the course of their official duties.

“Her actions – communicating with other State Department personnel and advisers about the official business of the department – fall squarely within the scope of her duty to run the Department and conduct the foreign affairs of the nation as Secretary of State,” Jackson wrote.

Jackson ruled the parents didn't sufficiency challenge that Clinton wasn't acting in her official capacity when she used the email server.

""The untimely death of plaintiffs' sons is tragic, and the Court does not mean to minimize the unspeakable loss that plaintiffs have suffered in any way,"" Jackson wrote in a 29-page opinion.

""Oh no! I'm just waiting and watching as this plays out. I will support whoever the nominee is,” she told the moderator while in Puerto Rico for a Clinton Global Initiative event.

In the interview last Thursday she clarified, “I never say never because I do believe in serving my country -- but it's not going to happen,” citing when former President Obama asked her to be his secretary of state after their hard-fought primary race in 2008.

Clinton, who lost the 2016 general election to Republican Donald Trump, posited during the interview that Trump's behavior as president underscores the double standard female candidates face.

""We've got one of the most emotionally acting-out people ever in the history of our country in the White House and I don't hear anybody saying, 'He's just too emotional,'” Clinton said, referring to a common critique of female politicians.

Last November, she told the BBC that “many, many, many people” were pressuring her to think about running for president again, but added, “I, as I say, never, never, never say never. ... But as of this moment, sitting here in this studio talking to you, that is absolutely not in my plans.""

57,Bloomberg News ex-reporter's wife says his lawyers threatened to 'ruin' family over China reporting,['Morgan Phillips'],"The wife of a former Bloomberg News reporter claimed Michael Bloomberg threatened to “ruin” her family financially if she spoke out about how the publication killed a story critical of leaders of the Chinese Communist Party.

Leta Hong Fincher, whose husband, Michael Forsythe, now writes for the New York Times, wrote that the former New York City mayor threatened to “devastate” her family if she jeopardized his financial ties to China.

“My story shows the lengths that the Bloomberg machine will go to in order to avoid offending Beijing,” Fincher began an editorial for The Intercept.

Fincher first explained that her husband wrote a Bloomberg News article connecting the dots between Chinese President Xi Jinping’s family’s vast and sudden accumulation of wealth and him assuming office.

BLOOMBERG HITS BACK AFTER TRUMP SAYS 'MINI MIKE' IS 'ILLEGALLY BUYING THE NOMINATION'

Immediately, her husband began to receive death threats by a woman who told him she represented a relative of Xi. The woman specifically conveyed threats to Forsythe’s entire family, consisting of his wife, a 6-year-old and an 8-year-old at the time. Bloomberg News urged the family not to say anything.

In October 2012, Fincher tweeted about the death threats she had received after the story on Xi.

Hours later, a Bloomberg manager called her husband and said, “Get your wife to delete her tweets.” She refused but did not discuss the issue further online as she needed the company to relocate her family from Beijing to Hong Kong where they would be safe from threats.

Months later her husband was working on a similar story for Bloomberg about financial ties between one of China’s richest men, Wang Jianlin, and the families of senior Communist Party Officials. Bloomberg suddenly killed the story and fired Forsythe over fears they would “be kicked out of China” if they ran the story.

Bloomberg dismissed allegations the company self-censored out of fear of offending the Chinese government. “Nobody thinks that we’re wusses and not willing to stand up and write stories that are of interest to the public and that are factually correct,” Bloomberg said at a press conference in 2013.

Even after firing Forsythe, Bloomberg lawyers in Hong Kong tried to force Forsythe and Fincher to sign NDAs, threatening “to devastate my family financially by forcing us to repay the company for our relocation fees to Hong Kong from Beijing and the advance on my husband’s salary that we took out, leave us with no health insurance or income, and take me to court if I did not sign a nondisclosure agreement — even though I had never been a Bloomberg employee.”

Fincher claimed Bloomberg’s attorney was going to demand they pay thousands of dollars to the company, including his legal fees, if she did not sign the agreement. When she hired the same attorneys who represented Edward Snowden to defend her, Bloomberg backed off.

DEMOCRACY 2020 DIGEST: BLOOMBERG'S POLL NUMBERS SOAR WITH SPENDING SURGE

Fincher said she hadn’t previously written of Bloomberg’s threatening behavior because she didn’t seek publicity and was “terrified” of financial ruin. “I am speaking out now because unlike so many other women, I am not bound by a nondisclosure agreement,” she explained. “Given the large number of women silenced by NDAs, it’s clear that there has been an environment of sexism at Bloomberg’s company. Bloomberg managers and lawyers treated me as though I were a piece of company property, an appendage of my husband, using intimidation and threats to try to bully me into submission.”

Last month, news broke that a number of women who worked for Bloomberg LP had filed lawsuits accusing Bloomberg of making crude remarks and fostering a hostile work environment for women. Bloomberg told ABC News he would not be releasing the women from their NDAs.

“You can't just walk away from it,” Bloomberg said. “They're legal agreements, and for all I know the other side wouldn't want to get out of it.”

Bloomberg has largely stepped away from his leadership role in the company, but maintains a large ownership stake, so much so that Bloomberg News announced it would not be digging into Bloomberg or any of his finances when he jumped into the presidential race. Instead they would cease all investigations of 2020 Democrats and instead focus on the Trump administration and campaign.

After almost a year of campaigning – complete with debates, town halls, hundreds of millions of dollars spent on advertising, and a biased media promoting their out-of-the-mainstream agenda – the crew of far-left Democratic presidential candidates remains stuck in mediocrity, with no one able to break out of the pack.

It’s become abundantly clear why the do-nothing Democrats in Congress – led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California – have been so focused on impeachment hoaxes and never-ending partisan investigations of President Trump. The truth is that they don’t want the public to pay attention to their looming electoral disaster.

DEMOCRACY 2020 DIGEST: BLOOMBERG'S POLL NUMBERS SOAR WITH SPENDING SURGE

The muddled results for Democrats from the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary earlier this month have only made matters worse. In fact, the situation has gone from bad to horrific.

The winners of the first two Democratic nominating contests are Pete Buttigieg, a 38-year old former mayor of a small Indiana city of 100,000, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, a socialist career politician from Vermont – a state with a population of about 620,000.

Buttigieg and Sanders won by slim and unconvincing margins. The Democratic Party’s earlier supposed front-runner – former Vice President Joe Biden – can barely string together a coherent sentence and has been exposed as a corrupt swamp creature.

The fading campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is taking on water and sinking fast. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the surprise third-place finisher in New Hampshire, is a totally unspectacular backbencher.

Due to this incredibly weak field of candidates, establishment Democrats are frantically trying to get their primary voters to give former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg a serious look.

Mini Mike – as President Trump has aptly nicknamed him – represents everything the left despises. Bloomberg is a billionaire – 60 times over – who is trying to buy the 2020 election and drown out the voices of everyday Americans.

Bloomberg governed as “Mayor Stop and Frisk” and even voiced support for throwing kids up against the wall to find out if they’re carrying guns.

And in today’s news cycle that’s dominated by stories concerning the #MeToo movement, Bloomberg has garnered his own troubling headlines such as this one from the Washington Post last weekend: “Mike Bloomberg for years has battled women’s allegations of profane, sexist comments.”

Besides this damning reality, on the campaign trail Bloomberg displays all the attributes of a subpar candidate who is better suited for the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He’s a hopelessly out of touch, thoroughly unlikable, small in stature, uninspiring poll-driven phony.

A day doesn’t go by without a story about Bloomberg either insulting some group, such as farmers, or remarking that African-American and Hispanic men “don’t know how to behave in the workplace.”

Bloomberg, who served as mayor of New York City from 2001 to 2013, is currently running for president as a liberal gun-grabbing, job-killing climate change-fighting evangelist.

But not so long ago, the same Mike Bloomberg supported the Iraq War, hosted President George W. Bush and the Republicans for the 2004 national convention at Madison Square Garden, and donated “$950,000 to Republican campaigns and political action committees,” according to The New York Times.

How must unhinged radical Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota feel about a potential party standard-bearer who’s supported financially over the years the likes of Republicans Mitt Romney, Fred Thompson, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush, Orrin Hatch, and Rudy Giuliani?

Bloomberg is the consummate political opportunist. Just as he’s using the policies of Ocasio-Cortez to mount a 2020 presidential run as a Democrat, he used the playbook of Rudy Giuliani in order to become elected as the Republican mayor of New York City in 2001 as Giuliani’s successor.

Just as there would be no President George H. W. Bush without Ronald Reagan’s eight years of peace and prosperity in the White House, there would be no Mayor Michael Bloomberg without him embracing Giuliani’s heroic eight-year turnaround of New York City from 1993 to 2001.

The juxtaposition of President Trump with Bloomberg is a dream come true for Republicans. Trump is the ultimate political outsider and genuine article, while Bloomberg is a poll-tested and calculating fake.

Add in the booming Trump economy and historic low unemployment rates across the board and it doesn’t take a genius to understand why the Democratic brain trust is jittery.

These are desperate times for Democratic elites. Their allies in the Trump-hating media are showing it. Should they embrace Bloomberg’s buckets of cash or destroy him as they did Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn.?

Trump Derangement Syndrome causes those afflicted to abandon all principles in exchange for political expediency. So the question is, how low will these leftists sink to find someone to try and stop the candidacy of Sanders the socialist firebrand? Just look at what they were willing to do in the case of disgraced lawyer and convicted felon Michael Avenatti.

If Bloomberg survives his first debate on Wednesday night in Las Vegas, there’s a distinct possibility that five candidates could walk away with at least one primary win on Super Tuesday March 3. With 14 states voting that day, a fractured outcome such as this would throw the Democratic presidential nomination race president into turmoil not seen since the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

There’s a real chance no candidate will arrive in Milwaukee for the Democratic National Convention this summer with the number of delegates needed to become the party’s presidential nominee on the first ballot.

If Democrats steal the nomination from Sanders and throw it to Bloomberg on the second ballot – along with his billions and his baggage – how will they convince Sanders supporters to stay on board in the wake of what unfolded in 2016 with Hillary Clinton and the Democrat National Committee colluding against Sanders?

To anyone paying close attention, this is fast becoming an impossible proposition. In fact, it’s much more likely that the legions of Bernie Sanders supporters either stay at home or find a third-party candidate to rally behind.

He Is The Author Of The No. New York Times Best-Selling Book']","Toward the end of his life, the legendary criminal defense attorney Clarence Darrow gazed back on his long career and sadly observed to a reporter: “There is no such thing as justice – in or out of court.”

Darrow knew through experience that, all too often, prosecutors are willing to abandon their ethical duty that requires them to see that justice is done. Instead, emboldened by their immense powers and unlimited resources, they become consumed by a zeal to win, sometimes at any cost.

Fairness and justice become secondary to the goal of gaining a conviction and a harsh penalty. The law, Darrow concluded, had evolved into a “horrible business.”

JUDGE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH ROGER STONE SENTENCING AMID CONTROVERSY

Darrow was likely right. His thesis can be seen in the unduly harsh punishment of Donald Trump’s former adviser Roger Stone that was sought by trial prosecutors, compounded by the irrational demand of more than 2,000 former Justice Department employees that Attorney General William Barr resign for attempting to insert reasonableness into the process.

Stone was found guilty by a Washington jury of making false statements, obstruction and witness tampering in a case that arose from former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. The four trial prosecutors, two of whom worked for Mueller, requested a seven- to nine-year prison sentence for Stone.

Barr and other senior Justice Department officials felt the recommended sentence was “excessive” under the facts and circumstances of the case. In an interview with ABC News, Barr explained that “when people are working on one case, and devoting a lot to it, they can sometimes lose perspective.”

After consulting with senior lawyers at the Justice Department, Barr was under the impression that the trial prosecutors would back off their draconian recommendation. Instead, according to Barr, he expected the prosecutors would “let the judge decide and explain why a lower sentence could be justified.” Obviously, this did not happen.

Barr called it a “miscommunication.” When he learned that the line prosecutors had advocated to the judge a seven- to nine-year sentence, Barr notified his staff that corrective action would need to be taken the following morning “to amend and clarify what our position was.”

Importantly, this decision was made before President Trump tweeted a criticism of the sentencing recommendation as “horrible, unfair and a miscarriage of justice.”

The following exchange with ABC News removes all doubt about political interference by the president.

ABC News: So just to be clear, did you talk to the president at all about your decision regarding the recommendations?

Barr: The recommendations on this case? Never.

ABC News: Anybody from the White House call you to try to influence you?

Barr: No. Nope. I have not discussed the Roger Stone case at the White House.

ABC News: At all?

Barr: At all.

Barr insisted that he didn’t need anyone to tell him that seven to nine years was an overly harsh sentence. He then posed a rhetorical question: “You think I need the president’s tweet to tell me that seven to nine years is excessive?” Barr added that he would “not be bullied or influenced” by anyone on any case.

While Darrow’s cynical view of overzealous prosecutors was surely a product of the many injustices he witnessed as a defense attorney, Barr is still a practicing idealist.

The attorney general refused to allow an injustice to occur on his watch. “I came to the view as my colleagues did that I wouldn’t support affirmatively advocating what I thought was an excessive sentence,” Barr said.

There is no evidence that President Trump or anyone in the White House had any involvement in Barr’s decision to revise the sentencing recommendation in the Stone case to a more reasonable and appropriate level. But that did not stop the more than 2,000 former Justice Department staff members from signing an online petition urging the attorney general to resign.

Did any of them bother to consult the facts or Barr’s explanation of what happened before they demanded that he be banished from the Justice Department? Did any of them consider that, by any reasonable standard, the trial prosecutors were wrong in seeking an extreme sentence or that the attorney general was attempting to dispense justice fairly and equitably? Apparently not.

As law professor Jonathan Turley pointed out: “The critics have shown the very same disregard for the facts, the merits, and the process that they ascribe to Barr.” Indeed, they have.

Before passing judgment, shouldn’t these former Justice Department officials have withheld their condemnation until the attorney general offers his testimony on the matter before the House Judiciary Committee in March?

This would be prudent, notwithstanding the fact that Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., has already prejudged Barr by accusing him of “the misuse of our criminal justice system for political purposes.”

Even more baffling, if not injudicious, is the move by the Federal Judges Association, which has reportedly called an emergency meeting to discuss the Justice Department’s intervention in the Stone case. Apparently these judges intend to disregard the same admonition they give to jurors that they must wait until all of the evidence is presented before reaching a conclusion.

This brings us to Tuesday’s decision by U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson who presided over the Stone trial. She has decided to proceed with the sentencing of the defendant on Thursday, despite compelling new evidence that the jury foreperson harbored extreme anti-Trump opinions which she may have concealed from the court during jury selection.

Jackson, an Obama appointee, expressed reluctance to hold a hearing to inquire about juror misconduct, although she said “I may decide to do it in an abundance of caution.” Fundamental fairness, not caution, demands that she hold such a hearing. Jackson’s failure to recognize this bodes poorly for Stone.

As I detailed in my recent column, there is ample evidence that the foreperson, Tomeka Hart (who is also a lawyer), is a Democratic activist who has communicated a string of social media posts critical of Trump and actively engaged in protests against him.

CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER

Before Hart was picked as a juror, she made specific comments about the Stone case, praised the Mueller investigation, and suggested that the president and his supporters (such as Stone) were racists.

At one point, Hart referred to Trump with a hashtag of “klanpresident.” When questioned during jury selection, Hart disclosed only her ties to the Democratic Party. It seems that she conveniently omitted her incendiary accusations of racism that would almost certainly have disqualified her from serving due to bias.

In America, we expect jurors to be fair and impartial. Hart’s record demonstrates an acute prejudice against the defendant by virtue of his close association with President Trump.

Hart should never have been permitted to sit in judgment of the case, much less to serve as the foreperson of the jury, who may have guided the convictions.

Stone deserves a new trial. If Judge Jackson doesn’t recognize the obvious, then Clarence Darrow will again be proven correct when he concluded: “There is no such thing as justice – in or out of the court.”

61,Gutfeld on Obama claiming credit for Trump’s economy,"['Greg Gutfeld', 'Greg Gutfeld Currently Serves As Host Of']","After former President Barack Obama claimed credit for America's economic boom, President Trump fired back, saying the boom is due to rolling back Obama's policies and cutting regulations and taxes.

So who's right? Who even cares? Think about it. The debate we're having isn't over how great things are. That ship has sailed. The media and Democrats see there's no more denying the success. It's now about quibbling over credit.

Fine. Let the Democrats have it. It won't win them an election. But it might reduce their tears. Maybe Obama did have something to do with today's economy. I mean, without Obama, would we have Trump?

TRUMP CAMPAIGN FIRES BACK AFTER OBAMA CLAIMS CREDIT FOR ECONOMIC BOOM

The fact is that this debate says a lot about life today. The Trump economy is so great that Trump haters now want credit for it. Next thing you know, Obama will claim credit for putting kids in cages. Why not? He did do it before Trump.

So it's confusing. In the Democrats' world, Obama isn't responsible for his results, only for the success of whoever came next.

Technically, then, President George W. Bush was responsible for Obama's success. And of course, without Bush's dad, we'd have no President Clinton. Couldn't you do this forever?

Who gets credit for George Washington's success? King George III, of course.

63,Mike Kerrigan: What I learned on my 'first' college visit with my son,"['Mike Kerrigan', 'Mike Kerrigan Is An Attorney In Charlotte']","It’s funny how a small corner of the earth can have outsized relevance in your life. For me, it’s a swing set on a playground at a Charlottesville, Virginia elementary school.

It was spring 2007, and I decided to take my six-year-old son Joe on a weekend trip to the University of Virginia, my alma mater. Not a college visit in the traditional sense, the kind parents often take with their high school-aged children. No time like the present, I figured, to get the boy to start bleeding Cavalier orange and blue. We gassed up my truck and headed north for Charlottesville.

It was the first trip I had taken with Joe, just a father and his eldest son. Usually not much of a planner, I was excited for this particular adventure and sketched out every detail in advance. I knew some of the highlights wouldn’t be of immediate interest to him, but I had hope. Like the ritual of the liturgy, I wanted my son to become familiar with something dear to me, even if he didn’t fully understand. We rolled into our hotel late Friday evening and hit the rack.

UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA STUDENT SAYS 'TOO MANY WHITE PEOPLE' AT SCHOOL'S NEW MULTICULTURAL CENTER: REPORT

I took Joe to my favorite breakfast spot first thing Saturday where he, then a picky eater, played with more than ate his food. I showed him my dorm and fraternity house, neither of which captured his fancy, and then the bar where I’d worked in college. We even went to a lacrosse game, a sport I then thought he might like. Joe took it all in with a serene countenance but didn’t seem smitten.

If you make the most of the moments you have by choosing to be fully present in them, your life will be rich indeed.

Then the tour took a more personal turn. I showed him the spot where I’d first laid eyes on his mother, my wife Devin, in the fall of 1993. The law school classroom where I registered for and feigned interest in family law just to be close to her. The spot on the lawn where I asked her to marry me. So many memories.

CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER

All of this registered with my son, but without the resonance I expected. Worse, we were running out of things to do, and it was barely four in the afternoon, with another day still to fill.

Exasperated, I asked Joe what he wanted to see. I won’t soon forget his response: ""I wouldn’t mind finding a swing set.""

That’s when it hit me. In my seven years of college and law school at Virginia, I’d never visited a swing set. Why would I have? For a guy who thought he knew every inch of his college town, the question caught me flat-footed: I had no earthly idea where to look.

Eventually, I remembered the Venable Elementary School on 14th Street, something I’d passed countless times as an undergraduate but never really noticed. We parked in the lot, empty on a Saturday, and I pushed my son and watched him swing back and forth with glee. It was the joy I had sought for him on my terms, but he only found on his.

What did I learn on that trip? Plenty.

First, travel is great fun and often leads to happiness. But our world will always assure us greater bliss is just around the corner, a mere jaunt-to-the-mountains away. There’s nothing wrong with such adventures, but they’re not necessary to find joy.

Sure, we had a blast in Charlottesville, especially after resetting around the swing set. But joy was never any further from us than our swing set back home. We had, and have, everything we need. I just needed to remember it.

Second, as my mom loved telling me when I was growing up, if you want to give God a laugh, tell Him your plans. I mapped out every detail of that weekend, but you can’t plan joy any more than you can schedule spontaneity or demand loyalty. Do your best but stay flexible, and always remember what John Lennon said: life is what happens to you while you’re busy making other plans.

Third, there’s always a new way to look at things, no matter how much you think you know. All of life’s lasting treasures – Faith, love, learning – are like that. You can think you have them figured out, but suddenly when you least expect it, they give you so much more. Now when I find myself vexed by a problem I cannot seem to solve, I ask myself “where’s the swing set?” New perspectives lead to new insights, so find them. This was my most important lesson.

It’s important because from that unanticipated vantage point I saw a young couple in love, walking hand-in-hand down 14th Street. They didn’t notice me any more than I’d have noticed a middle-aged guy swinging his kid in the periphery at their age. But gazing at them I realized how it was only yesterday that Devin and I were the young couple, walking aimlessly about with our whole lives still out in front of us.

This reflection was timely, for indeed, life is an unearned gift of time, that most precious commodity this side of eternity. How loved we must be, to be given so great a gift – a life, measured in time -- so freely! Use it well, and not only when you’re young. Always.

That’s what I learned in Charlottesville that really mattered. Whether you feel it or not, in the eyes of someone -- looking on from a swing set you don’t see -- you’re still the young person with everything out in front of you. Age doesn’t matter. That happens, quickly. Always being in the moment does matter. That’s a choice. And if you make the most of the moments you have by choosing to be fully present in them, your life will be rich indeed.

I’m sure I would have missed this important lesson if Joe hadn’t made his old man stop at the swings in Charlottesville. For that, I will always be grateful.

64,Jim Daly: Why my children do chores,"['Jim Daly', 'Jim Daly Is President Of Focus On The Family', 'Author Of']","Do you require your children to do chores? Should you?

Truth be told, it’s often a lot easier to do the work ourselves – especially when trying to manage the assignments we give our kids becomes a chore all its own.

But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t press through the inconvenience. In fact, the fate of your child’s future may depend on it.

JIM DALY: VALENTINE'S DAY -- WHAT DADS WANT

Generations ago, especially with an agricultural economy dominating the country’s landscape, children worked all the time. As the Industrial Revolution swept the nation, many children found themselves in factories, often working long hours and in dangerous conditions.

Fortunately, child labor laws of the early 20th century began protecting young children from being dangerously overworked and deprived of a basic education. But one-hundred years later, the pendulum has swung in the opposite direction. Too many of our children are now probably underworked.

It’s been my experience that families are happier and healthier when each member serves one another. It is not the parents’ role to serve their children – it’s their job to help raise them into successful adults.

From conversations I have and the people I see, many children today grow up without lifting a finger in their own households. I know parents who act as extracurricular directors for their children, toting Charlie from debate practice to church activities – not to mention, multiple club sports. It is not difficult to see why many children enter adulthood believing the world revolves around them.

Yet, I think it’s good for parents to make childhood a little unpleasant for their children and provide meaningful learning opportunities along the way. That’s because too much pampering without any responsibility produces highly self-centered adults.

The late conservative thought icon Sir Roger Scruton touched on this tension when describing his parenting philosophy. Some could argue he took it a little far, but he once remarked he wanted to deliberately make his children’s lives difficult and even unhappy if the result was making them more enjoyable company as adults.

From the time our children were relatively young, my wife and I thought it was important to give them weekly household duties appropriate to their ages. We also didn’t pay them for doing chores, because we wanted to teach them that every family member needs to chip in to help the household run.

As a boy, when I mowed the lawn for the first time, I felt a surge of confidence. Although chores may seem trivial, they instill a sense of self-worth that is crucial to kids’ success in life.

Chores gave our kids a sense of ownership in the family. Taking out the trash without being asked or weeding the sidewalks on Saturday allowed them to participate in something bigger than their own happiness.

It’s been my experience that families are happier and healthier when each member serves one another. It is not the parents’ role to serve their children – it’s their job to help raise them into successful adults.

Chores also give our kids a sense of self-efficacy – their belief in themselves.

As a boy, when I mowed the lawn for the first time, I felt a surge of confidence. Although chores may seem trivial, they instill a sense of self-worth that is crucial to kids’ success in life.

As a result of the gradual increase in household responsibilities, when our oldest went off to college, I was confident that he was prepared and equipped to manage himself.

It’s sad to see young adults incapable of doing basic things like laundry or who live like slobs when their mother is no longer around to pick up after them.

Our family has always loved the movie “Remember the Titans,” the film about a high school football team who overcomes the challenges of 1970s integration. Coach Boone, who is tough on his players, wisely tells his softer assistant coach, “You’re not doing these kids a favor by coddling them. You’re crippling them for life.”

In the same way, we’re not helping our children by giving them a life free from responsibility. If you want your kids to feel like they’re part of the family and become confident adults later in life, start by assigning them regular chores. They won’t thank you now, but they’ll most certainly be grateful down the road.

68,FBI’s Most Wanted Fugitives: 5 suspects in the last decade who remain at large,['Morgan Phillips'],"The FBI has maintained a ""Most Wanted"" list of the top ten most wanted criminals in the U.S. since 1950. In total, 523 fugitives have been listed, 10 of whom were women. Of that 523, 488 have been captured. Here are five fugitives added to the list in the last decade who remain at large:

Robert William Fisher

Fisher is wanted for allegedly killing his wife and two children, then blowing up their home in Scottsdale, Ariz., in 2001. Fisher, a cardiac technician and ex-Navy firefighter, was a child of divorce and vowed his children, aged 10 and 12, would never go through the same thing. Shortly before the mass killing, his wife, Mary Fisher, told friends that she was going to leave Robert.

Neighbors reported hearing a loud argument the night before Mary was shot in the back of the head and their children’s throats were slashed from ear to ear in the hours before their house exploded at 8:42 a.m. on April 10, 2001.

Fisher was named the only suspect in the case soon after. On April 20, authorities found Mary’s Toyota 4Runner and their dog, Blue, in Tonto National Forest, near the town of Young, Ariz., according to AZ Central. Police searched the area where the car and pet were found, but they allegedly did not search the complex network of caves within the forest. Some professional cavers suggested that Fisher could have used these to hide before either escaping, killing himself or dying of low levels of oxygen, as reported by AZ family.

He was added to the FBI Most Wanted fugitives list in June 2002.

Alexis Flores

Flores is wanted for the kidnapping, rape and murder of 5-year-old Iriana DeJesus in Philadelphia, Penn., in 2000. A Honduran itinerant worker, Flores is believed to have lived in the building where the child’s body was found, sexually assaulted, strangled and wrapped in a trash bag. The itinerant homeless man was believed to have disappeared at the same time as the little girl. Flores was then arrested for shoplifting in 2002 and forgery in 2005 in Arizona before he served 60 days in jail and was deported back to Honduras. In 2007, the FBI noticed that the DNA sample taken from the Philadelphia crime scene matched that of the Arizona convict and he was added to the fugitives list.

Jason Derek Brown

Brown is wanted for first-degree murder and armed robbery at a Phoenix movie theater in November 2004, after he allegedly shot an armored guard outside the theater then ran off with the theater’s cash on hand. He then fled to Las Vegas before driving to Orange County, Calif., to stay with relatives. When the FBI carried out an arrest warrant in December 2004, they missed him by two hours. Soon after, Brown became a “ghost” and went completely off the grid. In January 2005, authorities tracked down his abandoned vehicle at Portland International Airport, according to AZ Central.

According to the FBI, Brown “speaks fluent French and has a Masters Degree in International Business.”

“He is an avid golfer, snowboarder, skier, and dirt biker.

Yaser Abdel Said

An Egyptian resident of the U.S., Said is wanted for the murder of his two teenage daughters in Irving, Texas, in 2008. On January 1, 2008, Said lured the girls into his taxi cab under the pretense that he was going to take them out to eat.

Both of his daughters had confided in friends that Said had physically and sexually abused them. Shortly after Christmas 2007, Said’s daughters, Amina and Sarah, and his wife, Patricia, ran away to Tulsa, Okla., before Patricia reluctantly convinced Sarah to return to the girls’ abusive father with her, and later convinced Amina to return home from a friend’s house where she’d been staying. Amina had already made extensive plans to run away with her boyfriend once they raised enough money.

Then on Jan. 1, Said took both of his girls into his cab, kissed them and told them he was taking them out to eat. Patricia initially wanted to come along but Said told her he wanted to take them alone. He drove around for a while before shooting both of the girls in the cab. Amina, 18, died instantly but 17-year-old Sarah managed to call 911. ““Help, help! My dad shot me, my sister, I’m dying, I’m dying!” she told the operator shortly before succumbing to her injuries, as reported by PIX 11.

It’s believed that Said may be working as a taxi cab driver in New York City. He’s known to always wear dark sunglasses, even inside, smoke Marlboro Lights and frequent diners such as Denny’s or IHOP. He was added to the fugitives list in December 2014 with a $100,000 reward for any information leading to his arrest.

Eugene Palmer

Palmer was added to the FBI’s Most Wanted list on May 29, 2019, for allegedly shooting dead his daughter-in-law Tammy Palmer in September 2012 in Stony Point, New York. Eugene lived next door to Tammy and her husband, his son John. Tammy and John’s relationship soured and she filed for a restraining order against John. She threatened to file for divorce and sue for land which Eugene owned, which caused him to get into a bitter argument with Tammy

69,George Soros calls for Facebook execs' removal after comments on regulation,"['Sam Dorman', 'Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News. You Can Follow Him On Facebook']","Liberal billionaire George Soros continued railing against Facebook's leadership, saying on Tuesday that both the CEO and COO should be removed.

He took issue with CEO Mark Zuckerberg ""piously"" calling for government regulation as he helped to get President Trump reelected. In a letter to the editor, Soros told the Financial Times that Facebook should, on its own, reject political advertising.

""Mr Zuckerberg appears to be engaged in some kind of mutual assistance arrangement with Donald Trump that will help him to get reelected, Facebook does not need to wait for government regulations to stop accepting any political advertising in 2020 until after the elections on November 4,"" he said.

His comments came after Zuckerberg told the Munich Security Conference that more government regulation should come ""from the states on basically — take political advertising as an example — what discourse should be allowed?”

Soros, who leads the Open Society Foundation, argued that neither Zuckerberg nor Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg should be in control of the massive social media platform.

FACEBOOK HITS BACK AT SOROS CLAIM OF 'SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP' BETWEEN TRUMP, ZUCKERBERG

In January, The New York Times published an op-ed in which Soros accused Zuckerberg of acting out of monetary interest in supporting Trump's reelection.

""I believe that Mr. Trump and Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, realize that their interests are aligned — the president’s in winning elections, Mr. Zuckerberg’s in making money,"" he said.

Facebook did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment. The company previously disputed Soros' contention in a statement to Fox News.

“While we respect Mr. Soros’ right to voice his opinion, he’s wrong,” the spokesperson said. “The notion that we are aligned with any one political figure or party runs counter to our values and the facts.

71,Rudy Giuliani says Bloomberg took stop-and-frisk policy too far: 'We understood the law',"['Julia Musto', 'Julia Musto Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com']","Presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg cannot run away from his controversial stop-and-frisk policing, former New York City mayor and attorney for President Trump Rudy Giuliani said Tuesday.

Appearing on ""America's Newsroom"" with host Ed Henry, Giuliani said Bloomberg was a ""passionate supporter"" of stop and frisk and had previously asked him to write in support of the policy when he took office in 2002.

""And I did it, but I had some reluctance because he changed the program,"" he told Henry. ""The program that [NYPD Commissioners William] Bratton, [Howard] Safir and [Bernie] Kerik developed – they were the three who developed it – and I developed, was a much more careful program.""

TRUMP: BLOOMBERG'S 'STOP AND FRISK' POLICY SPARKED A 'REVOLUTION' IN NYC, GIULIANI WAS A 'FAR BETTER' MAYOR

Giuliani said that when the Department of Justice under the Clinton administration had wanted to bring a suit against the city of New York for ""violating civil rights,"" he talked then-Attorney General Janet Reno and Eric Holder out of bringing the suit using ""perfect"" statistics.

""That we were following – not race – we were following complaints. In other words, why did we search 70 percent African-American males? We did it because 75 percent of our complaints were of African-American males who committed violent crimes. So, who are we supposed to go look for?"" he asked.

Giuliani told Henry that under Bloomberg the numbers of stops skyrocketed from around 100,000 per year to 600,000.

""You just can't make a stop, which is what it kind of became,"" he remarked. ""We understood the law.""

Under the policy, police can temporarily detain, question and search civilians suspected of carrying weapons. While supporters say the practice saves lives by getting illegal weapons off the streets, critics say the directive unfairly targets minorities.

In 2011, the NYPD stopped 685,724 people, an overwhelming 88 percent of whom were deemed innocent. Crime in the Big Apple dropped roughly 80 percent since the Giuliani administration enacted ""stop, question and frisk"" in the mid-'90s.

""You should not put police officers in places where there's no crime. Otherwise, you're not going to have the police officers in the place where there are crimes,"" Giuliani continued. ""My use of stop, question and frisk was completely determined by CompStat. It was statistical.""

72,Curtis Hill: Black History Month 2020 -- remembering Harriet Tubman's American story of freedom,"['Curtis Hill', 'Curtis Hill Is Indiana S Attorney General.']","In the recent movie “Harriet,” the renowned Underground Railroad conductor Harriet Tubman is depicted offering a simple explanation for her astounding success leading slaves north to freedom.

“I went down south and brought them back,” she states. “God showed me the way.”

The movie captures beautifully the role that faith played in Tubman’s impressive life. If you haven’t yet seen it, Black History Month might be an appropriate time to treat yourself to this film. Beyond Tubman’s trust in God to order her steps, viewers also see the yearning for freedom that characterizes not only the black experience in America but indeed the human experience writ large.

JACK BREWER: BLACK HISTORY MONTH 2020 -- TRUMP'S POLICIES ARE BETTERING LIVES OF BLACK AMERICANS

We all desire the opportunity to live free. And here in the U.S.A., black history is an important aspect of our larger national story.

Freedom ultimately flourishes best when people from diverse backgrounds unite together in common cause to fight for it, defend it and protect it. For too much of America’s history, obviously, many white Americans either overtly participated in or tacitly supported the oppression of the black race. At the same time, however, the “Harriett” movie accurately shows the assistance lent to Tubman and escaping slaves by white Quakers and other white abolitionists. The risks they took as whites in the Underground Railroad enterprise were considerably less than those taken by blacks, whose very lives hung in the balance, but nonetheless these allies showed courage in standing up for justice and truth.

Frederick Douglass once touted the value of brotherhood and sisterhood among all people when he said, “I would unite with anybody to do right and with nobody to do wrong.”

In our own generation, the question is often asked whether we as a nation -- after all the years of slavery and discrimination -- are nowadays doing enough to recognize the roles of black Americans in our history. And certainly, it would seem to be high time for meaningful symbolism such as the proposed printing of a U.S. currency bill bearing the likeness of a heroic figure such as Tubman. Let’s get that done.

Even more important than such symbolism, however, is preserving the spirit that motivated these freedom fighters.

Once she had escaped to the North, Tubman could have simply counted her blessings to have survived her dangerous journey. She could have settled back and enjoyed her own newfound life as a free woman. Instead, she risked her life to return time after time to the South to rescue others from bondage. Historians say she made approximately 13 such trips (to say nothing of her roles as a cook, nurse, scout and spy for the Union Army during the Civil War).

“Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction,” President Ronald Reagan once said. “We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like in the United States where (people) were free.”

That’s part of the lesson of Black History Month. And that’s part of the lesson of America’s story as a nation.

73,Ancient Biblical era temple discovered in Israel,['James Rogers'],"An international team of archaeologists has uncovered an ancient Biblical era temple in Israel.

The ruins of the Canaanite temple were discovered within a large Bronze Age settlement in what is now National Park Tel Lachish. The temple, which dates back to the 12th century B.C., was once part of the ancient Canaanite city of Lachish.

Professor Yosef Garfinkel of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Professor Michael Hasel of Southern Adventist University in Tennessee led a team of researchers that uncovered the temple.

DNA DISCOVERY IDENTIFIES LIVING DESCENDANTS OF BIBLICAL CANAANITES

Lachish was built around 1800 B.C., destroyed and rebuilt on a number of occasions over the following centuries, according to Hebrew University.

“The settlement is mentioned in both the Bible and in various Egyptian sources and was one of the few Canaanite cities to survive into the 12th century BCE,” it explained in a statement.

The city’s deliverance ""into Israel's hands,"" for example, is described in the Book of Joshua.

The ancient Canaanite civilization, which created the first alphabet and is mentioned frequently in the Bible, has long fascinated historians.

STUNNING BIBLICAL DISCOVERY: MYSTERIOUS TEMPLE NEAR JERUSALEM REVEALS ITS SECRETS

""This excavation has been breath-taking,” said Garfinkel in a statement. “Only once every 30 or 40 years do we get the chance to excavate a Canaanite temple in Israel. What we found sheds new light on ancient life in the region. It would be hard to overstate the importance of these findings.”

The temple’s layout is similar to other Canaanite temples that have been discovered in northern Israel, according to the archaeologists. Researchers also unearthed a host of artifacts from the site, including bronze cauldrons, jewelry inspired by the ancient Egyptian goddess Hathor, daggers and ax-heads decorated with images of birds and scarabs, which are ancient beetle-shaped carvings. A gold-plated bottle inscribed with the name of Pharaoh Rameses II was also discovered, along with two bronze figurines of armed “smiting gods” and a pottery sherd engraved with an ancient Canaanite script.

The piece of pottery bears the Hebrew letter “samech” marked by an elongated vertical line crossed by three perpendicular shorter lines. “This makes it the oldest known example of the letter and a unique specimen for the study of ancient alphabets,” explained Hebrew University in the statement.

74,Sen. Chuck Grassley: Religious freedoms under attack – US can promote and protect liberty globally,"['Sen. Chuck Grassley', 'Chuck Grassley', 'R-Ia. Is The Chairman Of The Senate Finance Committee.']","The Declaration of Independence recognizes each individual is endowed with inalienable rights. Americans cherish our blessings of freedom, including the rights of individuals to worship freely. From one generation to the next, Americans enjoy the freedom to live one’s faith, no matter one’s creed, and to share in those traditions with family and loved ones.

Religious liberty is a protected constitutional right enshrined in the First Amendment. It serves as a shining beacon of freedom from sea to shining sea. America can leverage our leadership to spark religious freedom in regions of the world blanketed by discrimination and oppression.

America’s founders adopted our founding charter of freedom in the 18th centUury. And yet today in the 21st century, religious discrimination endangers innocent lives in cultures and societies around the world.

LATHAN WATTS: OUR GREATEST PRESIDENTS BELIEVED IN RELIGIOUS LIBERTY – AMERICANS SHOULD PRESERVE THEIR LEGACY

People are persecuted for their faith by authoritarian dictatorships and terrorist groups. Countries like China, North Korea and Pakistan restrict their citizens’ rights to practice their chosen religion and worship without fear. To combat reigns of terror on people of faith, Congress passed the International Religious Freedom Act in 1998.

President Trump keeps delivering on his promise to stand strong for religious freedom. In fact, the Trump administration has made it a top foreign policy priority.

In December, the State Department issued a report that re-designated nine countries as “countries of particular concern” for carrying out or tolerating systematic, ongoing and egregious violations of religious freedom. It placed eight countries on a special watch list for governments that have engaged in or tolerated severe violations of religious freedom.

Countries designated “of particular concern” can be subject to further actions by the United States, including increased diplomatic pressure and protest; reduced diplomatic, scientific or other engagement; reduced development assistance; or, sanctions.

These efforts are needed more than ever. Persecution around the world continues to put people of faith in harm’s way. In some areas, the climate of oppression is only getting worse. For example, the People’s Republic of China plans to enforce additional restrictions on religious groups starting this month.

While the United States doesn’t have the singular authority to stop the religious persecution occurring in China, we can apply pressure on Chinese leaders by linking the need for religious freedom to aspects of our bilateral relationship that matter to China. We are in a powerful position to influence Chinese leaders to honor fundamental human rights. Fighting for religious freedom should be a central part of the United States’ relationship with China.

In October 2018, I sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressing my concerns about the ongoing religious persecution of religious minorities by the communist regime in China. I am encouraged the State Department placed visa restrictions last fall on Chinese government and Communist Party officials who are believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, the detention or abuse of Uighurs, Kazakhs or other members of Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang, China.

As Iowa’s senior U.S. senator, I stand shoulder to shoulder with people of faith and support a Senate resolution that calls for the global repeal of blasphemy, heresy and apostasy laws.

The Department of Commerce also added 28 Chinese entities connected to Xinjiang abuses to its Entity List, which names foreign persons, governments or companies engaged in activities contrary to U.S. national security and/or foreign policy interests and requires special licensing to conduct business with U.S. companies.

What’s more, I would like to see the United States help citizens from countries like Russia, Bangladesh and Sudan who live under authoritarian regimes and face persecution for faith and religious beliefs. Whereas Americans have enjoyed the freedom to worship for more than 200 years, a number of countries punish individuals who engage in expression deemed by their government to be blasphemous, heretical, apostate or defamatory of religion.

As Iowa’s senior U.S. senator, I stand shoulder to shoulder with people of faith and support a Senate resolution that calls for the global repeal of blasphemy, heresy and apostasy laws.

Blasphemy laws are a vehicle for egregious violations of religious freedom and related human rights. As the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) notes, these laws inappropriately position governments as arbiters of truth or religious rightness. They exacerbate religious intolerance and discrimination, and embolden extremists to commit violent acts against perceived blasphemers.

These laws affect Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Bahá'í, secularists and many other groups. USCIRF research has found blasphemy charges are often used for sectarian or political purposes, and foster religious intolerance, discrimination and violence. As a human race, we ought to support the sacred right of individuals to worship in peace without fear of persecution. Whether one worships in a synagogue, mosque, church or elsewhere, Americans can’t take religious liberty for granted.

Indeed, America must keep our beacon of liberty shining brightly for all the world to see. As a country founded on individual, God-given rights, we must advance human rights and religious freedoms for our brothers and sisters around the world. We must work to identify and combat discrimination, not look the other way and allow abuses to hide in the shadows.

75,Bruce Ashford: Does God answer prayers?,"['Bruce Riley Ashford', 'Bruce Ashford Is The Provost Of Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary. His Latest Book Is']","As a seminary professor, I get questions like this all the time. And while my answers typically differ based on the context and the person asking, there’s one element I always incorporate into the answer: God is real and he does answer prayers.

I always make the point that “God is real” because if he is not real, there is no good reason to pray.

But if God is real, that changes everything. It means we pray for the same reason that we eat and drink: to nourish our souls just as we nourish our bodies. Our bodies will wither away if we do not eat or drink. That is a fact. And that fact drives us to eat and drink.

JOSHUA ROGERS: MY AWFUL REALIZATION AFTER HONKING AT THE DRIVER IN FRONT OF ME

But beyond that, the question that nags at many people is whether God actually answers prayers.

I won’t try to sugarcoat the answer. Those of us who follow God continue to wrestle with this question, even when we think they’ve got the answer figured out. But remember where we started: The key question is, Is God real?

If God is real, it changes our approach to unanswered prayer. So whatever else is going on, whatever we don’t know, there’s one thing we can know for sure: When we pray, God is listening. We aren’t just speaking into an empty room.

God really answers prayers. Sometimes he says, “yes.” Other times, he says, “no.” Still other times, he might say, “wait for a while before I make my answer clear.” And while we don’t usually like the “no” or “wait for a while” answers, we shouldn’t miss that those are answers, too.

God is wiser than us and kinder than us; when he answers our prayers in surprising ways, it’s not because he lives to ruin our fun. Quite the opposite, like a good parent, he always gives an answer that flows from his wisdom and love. His wisdom is more loving than ours and his love is wiser than ours, and sometimes his wise love for us involves denying our request.

More importantly, when we pray, God will often do things in our life that are not directly related to our particular prayer. He will do things to change us, to make us into the type of person he wants us to be. And the changes he makes will not usually be sudden or dramatic but slow and deep and profound—similar to the way our family and friends change us over the course of years.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

The more we remember that God is a real, active, living, loving person, the more the question of unanswered prayer will recede into the background. Our prayers to him aren’t arrows we’re launching into a far off heaven. They are words spoken to God’s ear, part of a conversation in which we speak, God listens, and God responds.

This means that the most important aspect of prayer will always be the ways we come to know God and know ourselves better. After all, I don’t measure my human relationships by the number of times a friend does what I ask. I measure those relationships by whether I know those people and love them—and am known and loved by them.

In prayer, God sees us for who we are. He knows his children fully—for all of our flaws and sins and secrets—and yet at the same time loves us fully. That is what each of us wants—to be fully known and yet fully loved. That is what God offers to us in prayer.

Why should we bother to pray? Because God is real. Because our souls will wither if we do not nourish our relationship with God. Because God answers prayer. And because in prayer, we experience the unending love of a perfect Father.

You Can Follow Christen S Blog On Instagram At']","Have you ever hesitated to ask God for something for fear He will think you are testing Him? I pondered this conundrum recently while reading the story of Gideon in the Old Testament. Gideon was an Israelite in a time when God’s people were living in oppression at the hands of the Midianites. After seven years, the angel of the Lord appeared to Gideon, telling him that God would help him lead an army to defeat the Midianites and bring the Israelites out of captivity.

Gideon then asked God to give him a physical sign of reassurance saying, “If you will save Israel by my hand as you have promised -- look, I will place a wool fleece on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece and the ground is dry, then I will know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you said” (Judges 6:36-37). God granted Gideon’s petition and the next morning the fleece was completely wet while the ground underneath remained dry.

As if God hadn’t been gracious enough at that point, Gideon had the boldness to go back and make a second appeal, saying, “Do not be angry with me. Let me make just one more request. Allow me one more test with the fleece, but this time make the fleece dry and let the ground be covered with dew” (Judges 6:39). I paused at this point in the story thinking surely God was about to give Gideon a slap on the wrist for his lack of faith and presumptuous request. But the very next line simply records, “That night God did so” (Judges 6:40).

GOOGLE AND GOD: HOW CHURCHES ARE USING TECH TO REACH PEOPLE SEEKING RELIGIOUS ADVICE

At first glance, I was dumbfounded by this passage, because when God initially gave the Israelites the Ten Commandments and instructions on how to live, He told them, “Do not put the Lord your God to the test” (Deuteronomy 6:16). Yet when Gideon asked God to give him not one but TWO tangible signs of reassurance, God did not rebuke or punish him for “testing” him, but instead graciously granted his prayer.

I dug further into this, reading several Biblical commentaries about whether or not Gideon displayed a lack of faith in this particular encounter with God. I read and reread the passage, looking for that one “aha” explanation that would clear it all up for me. I wound up even more confused. I couldn’t find a definitive answer on whether or not Gideon was testing God.

I was about to give up my desperate search, but then God revealed something new to me. I had been so zeroed in on Gideon’s fleece encounter, I had neglected to focus on the next part of the story.

In the very next passage, Gideon is preparing his men for battle against the Midianites. He had 32,000 men to begin with, but God instructed, “You have too many men. I cannot deliver Midian into their hands, or Israel would boast against me, ‘My own strength has saved me’” (Judges 7:2). So God instructed Gideon to send home all the men who were afraid. Gideon obeyed, and 22,000 men left. God then told Gideon their numbers were still too large and gave him another direction on how to separate the soldiers. Gideon obeyed, and after this test, he was left with only 300 men. Because of Gideon’s obedience, God was able to bring the Israelites to a victory that no one could deny was to HIS credit, rather than the strength of their army. When faced with a seemingly impossible command to pare down his army, Gideon not once protested.

I realized after reading this second part of God and Gideon’s interaction that I had been asking the wrong questions. I was busy focusing on the aspects of the story we don’t know for certain while neglecting the things we do.

We do know that God is a good and faithful God (Psalm 107:1). We know His mercy never ends (Lamentations 3:22). We know that God knows everything we will ever do before we’ve ever lived (Psalm 139:16), and yet creates us anyway, knowing we will hurt and disappoint Him. We may not fully know how God felt about Gideon’s request, but we do know He granted it.

Pastor Georgie Kelsey recently preached a sermon titled “The Power of Love” highlighting that God IS love. It sounds so simple on the surface, but she revealed there is immeasurable power in this truth. 1 Corinthians 13:4 tells us, “Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.” God and love are interchangeable. He is patient and kind. He never changes.

Gideon was just another imperfect human called to follow an absolutely perfect God. I realized after seeing the story in full-scope that I had rushed to judge Gideon with a legalistic mindset, thinking he deserved some type of reprimand. And in a strange way, by looking for an answer as to why God hadn’t punished Gideon, I myself was testing God. In my search for an answer, God gave me the same grace He gave Gideon by reminding me that He and only He knows what is best. He had a personal relationship with Gideon and knew exactly what he needed, just as He does with me. Whether Gideon was right or wrong in his requests with the fleece didn’t matter, because God showed that His love was bigger. His mercy and His plans will always outweigh our weaknesses.

His Email Is Frank.Miles Foxnews.Com.']","Denny Hamlin won his second consecutive Daytona 500 and third in five years on Monday night as he surged past Ryan Newman on the final lap of a second overtime shootout.

Hamlin is the first driver since Sterling Marlin in 1995 to win consecutive Daytona 500s, but his celebration in victory lane was subdued.

The NASCAR superstar was trying to find the delicate balance of celebrating a milestone victory while showing proper respect to an injured driver.

Newman’s accident is part of the thrill that draws fans to the sport and is an adrenaline rush that fuels the drivers. That he survived is because of nonstop work on safety for nearly two decades. That work will never end.

Initially unaware of Newman’s situation, Hamlin did victory burnouts and celebrated with his team.

DENNY HAMLIN WINS THIRD DAYTONA 500; RYAN NEWMAN HOSPITALIZED IN FIERY WRECK AT FINISH

“The number one thing that NASCAR always does is put safety before competition, you’ve got to have a car that’s safe,” said Hamlin. “You’ve got to have all your equipment that’s safe, and the sport has been very fortunate to not have anything freak or weird happen for many, many years. But a lot of that is because of the development and the constant strive to make things better and safer.

“I thank my lucky stars every day that I came in the sport when I did.”

VICTORY

Hamlin had eight Ford drivers lined up behind him as the leader on the second overtime shootout without a single fellow Toyota driver in the vicinity to help him. It allowed Newman to get past him for the lead, but the bumping in the pack led to Newman’s hard turn into the wall.

Hamlin’s win last year was a 1-2-3 sweep for Joe Gibbs Racing and kicked off a yearlong company celebration in which Gibbs' drivers won a record 19 races and the Cup championship.

Now his third Daytona 500 win puts him alongside six Hall of Fame drivers as winners of three or more Daytona 500s.

He tied Dale Jarrett – who gave JGR its first Daytona 500 win in 1993 – along with Jeff Gordon and Bobby Allison. Hamlin trailed Cale Yarborough’s four wins and the record seven by Richard Petty.

This victory came after just the second rain postponement in 62 years, a pair of red flag stoppages and two overtimes. The 0.014 margin of victory was the second closest in race history, trailing only Hamlin’s win over Martin Truex Jr. in 2016 (0.01 seconds).

The win in “The Great American Race” is the third for Toyota, all won by Hamlin.

Gibbs has four Daytona 500 victories as an owner.

Gibbs insisted they had no idea Newman’s situation was serious.

“If you think about all the wrecks that we’ve had over the last, I don’t know, how many number of years, and some of them looked real serious, we’ve been so fortunate,” Gibbs said. “Participating in sports and being in things where there’s some risk ... in a way, that’s what (drivers) get excited about. We know what can happen. You just don’t dream that it would happen.”

FAMILY

Hamlin has been quoted as saying he wanted to be the father of boys.

But now, he’s a girl dad and he’s so proud.

“Your sons, they’re going to be like, ‘Ah, dad, whatever.’ You see women, when they grow up, always have that special bond with their dad. I have it with my kids for sure and it’s certainly special to have girls.”

Hamlin said with a chuckle, “Even though, admittedly, I’ve wanted boys every time, I’m so happy with the girls I have. They’ve just been such great kids.”

He has two daughters: Taylor is 7 and Molly is 2.

WORTH

Hamlin races in the NASCAR Cup Series and competes on a limited basis in the Xfinity series. Throughout his career, he has amassed 37 Cup wins, including the 2016 and 2019 Daytona 500 as well as the 2010 and 2017 Southern 500. Hamlin has qualified for the NASCAR Playoffs 12 times.

78,Ryan Newman: What to know about the NASCAR star,"['Frank Miles', 'Frank Miles Is A Reporter', 'Editor Covering Geopolitics', 'Military', 'Crime', 'Technology', 'Sports For Foxnews.Com. His Email Is Frank.Miles Foxnews.Com.']","NASCAR driver Ryan Newman survived a horrific crash on the final lap of the Daytona 500 Monday night.

Newman’s car slammed into the wall at nearly 200 mph, flipped, got T-boned by another car, flipped several more times and skidded to a halt in flames.

Here is more about the 42-year-old driver and 2008 Daytona 500 champion.

DENNY HAMLIN WINS THIRD DAYTONA 500; RYAN NEWMAN HOSPITALIZED IN FIERY WRECK AT FINISH

SURVIVAL

Newman’s car continued to skid upside down along the speedway and crossed the finish line in flames as safety crews hurried to snuff out the fire and cut “Rocketman” loose. It took about eight minutes for workers to roll his car right-side up, and medical personnel used black screens to block spectator views as Newman was placed in a waiting ambulance and taken to Halifax Medical Center.

A sense of relief spread across Daytona International Speedway after the crash Monday night.

There has not been a fatality in NASCAR’s elite Cup Series since Dale Earnhardt died in a crash on the final lap of the 2001 Daytona 500.

Nineteen years later, it’s clear that Earnhardt’s death probably saved Newman’s life.

NASCAR spent the last two decades working to improve safety regulations by installing energy-absorbing walls around tracks, mandating the use of head-and-neck restraints attached to helmets and continuing to make improvements to the cars.

NASCAR has declined in popularity since the safety changes that followed Earnhardt’s death, almost falling back to its roots as a regional sport.

Newman’s crash surely will elicit calls for NASCAR to do even more.

CONTROVERSY

Newman, an Indiana native who graduated with an engineering degree from Purdue, has been a harsh critic of NASCAR’s struggles to keep cars on the racing surface, even getting fined for public comments the sanctioning body considered negative.

In 2010, he said fans shouldn’t even go to the track to see races at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama.

Newman had escaped several scary wrecks at Daytona and Talladega over the years. His car went airborne, flipped repeatedly and landed on its roof in the 2003 Daytona 500. He had a similar crash-landing at Talladega in 2009.

His latest one will go down in Daytona history along with Austin Dillon’s memorable crash into the catch fence on the final lap of the 2015 July race at Daytona. His car went airborne and tore down part of the fence and injured several fans. The car, with its engine already resting on another part of the track, ended up on its roof and then was smashed into by Brad Keselowski’s car. Dillon remarkably walked away unscathed.

FAMILY

The father of two daughters recently announced his separation from wife Krissie after 16 years of marriage.

""We will continue to jointly raise our girls, while remaining friends and continuing to work together supporting Rescue Ranch,"" he wrote just four days before the fiery crash, mentioning his animal welfare work. ""Thank you for the years of support and friendship. We ask that (our) daughters' privacy be respected at this time.""

Right before the race Monday night, his estranged wife tweeted about the family affair: ""I am,"" she said about watching the race. ""Would love to see my girls in [Victory Lane] but always praying for a safe race.""

79,‘Happy Days’ star Henry Winkler on being labeled one of Hollywood’s nicest stars: ‘I am grateful’,"['Julius Young', 'Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News.']","Henry Winkler is one of the two nicest people in Hollywood — he and Tom Hanks.

That’s a truth widely acknowledged among members of the media who have covered the two legendary actors, and while Winkler doesn’t always want to accept it – “Oh, I don’t know about that!” – he’s certainly floored by the praise.

“I am friendly and I'm grateful. I am grateful that I walk on this Earth. And it makes me happy. And I love meeting people that I go to the movies [to see] or I watch on TV. You know, it makes me happy. It really does.”

HENRY WINKLER TWEETS WHILE FISHING, SHOWS OFF GREAT CATCH

Fox News recently spoke with Winkler, 74, at the PaleyLive LA event celebrating the career of the esteemed performer, most notably, the 45th anniversary of the beloved TV show “Happy Days.” Winkler broke out as Arthur “Fonzie” Fonzarelli in the famed 1970s sitcom, which he never fathomed would become a hit.

“No. You know what? You never know,” Winkler said of the show’s decade-long run, which lasted from 1974 through 1984. “You get on the train and you just keep your head down and do your work and hopefully, you get better and better and better.”

'HAPPY DAYS' STAR HENRY WINKLER SAYS RON HOWARD’S ‘FEELINGS WERE HURT’ BY FONZIE’S SUCCESS

“You don't know where that train is going,” he added. “You think you're going on a short ride to New Jersey and you wind up in L.A. It's amazing. You know, July 24th, I'm in the new Wes Anderson movie along with a star-studded lineup. Who knew?”

Last year, it was reported that Winkler would be joining the ensemble cast of Bill Murray, Adrien Brody, Jeffrey Wright and a boat of others in Anderson’s period piece “The French Dispatch,” a film set during the 1950s at the Paris bureau of an American Newspaper.

Winkler simply said he was happy to be a part of Anderson’s first live-action film since “The Grand Budapest Hotel” in 2014, for which Anderson garnered three Oscar nominations for producing, directing and screenplay.

In reflecting on his meteoric rise in Hollywood since he created the magnetic “Fonz” character, Winkler dished on the ultra-competitive landscape that is showbiz and said despite his success, Garry Marshall, the show’s creator, in no way would allow anyone to get out of line. He said Marshall promoted a family dynamic within the cast.

HENRY WINKLER ONCE TALKED SUICIDAL FONZIE FAN OFF LEDGE: 'I DON’T KNOW WHERE I GOT THE NERVE'

“Never. Not on the set,” Winkler said when asked if he experienced any resentment of any kind while working as Fonzarelli. “I never felt it.”

“We were as a family and as a unit,” Winkler said, adding that Marshall had once admonished him on the set for interrupting him as he was acknowledging the guest cast following a day of taping.

“First of all, Garry Marshall – rest his soul – would never stand for gumph. He would never stand for bad behavior,” Winkler explained. “I once interrupted him when he was introducing the guest cast at the end of the show. He put the microphone down and took me aside and told me never to do that again. And I never did.”

Though many on the outside might look at Winkler and marvel at the storied career he’s worked hard to build and maintain, the “Barry” co-star assured us “not so many years” have been as successful for him as one might believe.

HENRY WINKLER WINS FIRST EMMY AWARD AFTER FOUR DECADES IN SHOWBIZ

“It just seems that way,” he said. “There were years when there was very little water in the trough.”

Winkler added that in order to keep his dream alive while work was scarce, he developed his skill in other areas of writing and film production.

“I'll tell you what you do,” Winkler said leaning in, as if he were preparing to dole out top secret information. “If you believe in yourself and you don't want to be a flash in the pan, then you figure out, 'What else can I do?' So I started producing. I tried directing. I write children's books. And here I am doing 'Barry.' And we start again April 1st, shooting the third season.”

Winkler couldn’t contain his excitement in announcing the Bill Hader-helmed “Barry” would begin filming its upcoming season soon and became even more electric when we mentioned his status as an avid fly-fisherman.

'HAPPY DAYS' STAR HENRY WINKLER STRIPS DOWN TO POSE AS NUDE ART MODEL FOR 'BETTER LATE THAN NEVER'

“I love it so much. I can't tell you,” he gushed. “Fly-fishing is like a washing machine for your brain. No matter what bothers you, you cannot concentrate on anything but you, the fly resting on the water and the fish that comes to take it.”

We transitioned the response into asking the all-time good guy, who has been married to Stacey Weitzman for 42 years, how he manages to keep so many close friends in such a cutthroat business.

“Well, sometimes you have to work at it. You know, it depends on the person,” he said. “But if you want to be friends with someone, then pick up the phone. Don't wait for someone else to call you.”

“There are people I've called in 1984 and I'm still waiting for the phone to ring,” Winkler quipped. “You know, you kinda take them off your call list after a while and some people, I'm friends with for 40 years.”

80,700-pound black bear shot in New Jersey sets world record,"['Janine Puhak', 'Janine Puhak Is An Editor For Fox News Lifestyle. Follow Her On Twitter At']","A 700-pound bear shot in New Jersey last year has set a new world record as the largest black bear ever killed with a bow and arrow in North America.

Last week, the Pope and Young Club, a national bowhunting organization, announced that there was a new world record for the largest bow-harvested black bear on the continent. The bear was shot by outdoorsman Jeff Melillo on Oct. 14, in Morris County.

On Feb. 8, the bowhunting and conservation group Pope and Young Club assembled a special panel of judges during the Great American Outdoor Show in Harrisburg, Penn. to verify the record, the club said in a news release.

Melillo’s bear scored 23 5/16, toppling a record set in 1993 by a hunter in Mendocino County, Calif.

""It has been an inspiring journey, to say the least,” Melillo, a native of New Jersey, said in a statement. “Many years ago, I read an article in Outdoor Life magazine stating that the new world record black bear will most likely come from New Jersey. They were spot on, and I never doubted it for one second.”

“I'm very grateful that I get to be a part of all this. Pursuing bears with bow and arrow is a passion of mine,” the bowhunter continued, thanking the state Division of Fish and Wildlife and United Bow Hunters of New Jersey.

Eli Randall, records director for the Pope and Young Club, admitted he was “not prepared” for how large the black bear truly was.

""I knew I was going to be looking at an impressive black bear skull, as it was officially measured at over 23 inches and weighed in at 700 pounds,” Randall said. “I was not prepared for the amount of mass the skull possessed, not only was the skull huge, but the bone structure was the heaviest I had ever seen.”

Rick Mowery, communications and marketing manager for the Pope and Young Club, told Fox News that the size of the bear was a testament to good wildlife management by the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife.

“However, species should be managed by sound, scientific practices, not emotions. Recent hunting bans are unhealthy for residents, bear populations, and are counter to the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation,” Mowery said.

New Jersey’s black bear hunt has caused controversy in recent years, as Gov. Phil Murphy vowed to end the practice during his campaign and in 2018 instituted a ban on hunting bears on state lands. At present, the New Jersey Sierra Club continues to seek a complete ban.

After a nearly 30-year hiatus, the hunt was reintroduced in the Garden State in 2003 to control a growing bear population.

81,Test drive: The 2020 Toyota 4Runner TRD Pro is an old-school truck with new tricks,"['Gary Gastelu', ""Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor. Follow Him""]","The Toyota 4Runner is an oldie but goodie. And I’m talking about the new one.

The 2020 4Runner is the latest edition of a model that dates back to 2010. It’s received several upgrades along the way, but the basics are pretty much the same: Body-on-frame construction, a 270 hp 4.0-liter V6 engine, a five-speed automatic transmission and a part-time four-by-four drivetrain.

Oh, it also has a tailgate window that rolls down. That’s about as old-school as it gets.

Along with the new Jeep Wrangler, the 4Runner is the only mainstream midsize SUV you can buy that sticklers would consider a “truck,” although the rebooted Ford Bronco will be joining them later this year.

Unlike the Wrangler, the 4Runner’s roof can’t be removed and its front suspension is independent. Both of those attributes contribute to a more refined on-road ride. All things considered, it kind of splits the difference between the Wrangler and Jeep Grand Cherokee.

4Runner prices start at $37,240 for an entry-level two-wheel-drive SR5 and top out with the $50,985 TRD Pro. All models get standard automatic emergency brakes and adaptive cruise control for 2020, plus an infotainment system with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Alexa, just like them fancy modern cars have. There’s even an optional dashcam that can be used to capture moments, including accidents and break-ins, or record and map longer journeys. In evolutionary terms, the 4Runner is a shark with frickin' lasers on it.

The TRD Pro comes loaded with off-road gear that includes high-performance Fox shock absorbers that can handle long rides on rough roads without overheating, a one-inch front suspension lift, an aluminum front skid plate, a throaty TRD exhaust, 17-inch wheels with meaty all-terrain tires and a basket-style roof rack to augment its already huge cargo bay. Easy clean Softex-upholstered seats and all-weather floor mats complement all of the above.

The TRD Pro also gets an electronic locking rear differential, Toyota’s low-speed Crawl Control for pedal-free rock crawling and a Multi-Terrain Select traction management system with settings for a variety of surfaces from mud to moguls.

With just 9.6-inches of ground clearance, that front suspension and open front differential, a stock TRD Pro can’t handle the most extreme terrain out there, but you’ll literally have to go out of your way to get it stuck. It scurries up rock-strewn trails with ease and rips through ruts without being a pain in the butt.

It also maintains its composure on road, thanks in part to Toyota’s clever Kinetic Dynamic Suspension system, which uses hydraulic mounts on its roll bars to control body movement on pavement without restricting its articulation during slow, off-road maneuvers. It won’t fool you into thinking it’s a Toyota Rav4 on the street, but is much smoother and quieter than the Toyota Tacoma pickup.

Unfortunately, while most of the 4Runner’s attributes have improved with age, its fuel economy rating is from another era at a dismal 16 mpg city and 19 mpg highway. Another gear or five in the transmission probably wouldn’t hurt, but people appear to be willing to pay the price at the pump, because Toyota sold 130,000 4runners last year. That's about three times as many as it sold in 2010. Perhaps more impressive is that the 4Runner is J.D. Power's most dependable midsize SUV and holds its value better than anything but the retro Wrangler and Toyota's over-the-hill pickups.

Old school-style trucks clearly still hold a lot of appeal.

82,"Nevada trophy hunting convention still includes trips to shoot captive lions, undercover video shows","['Frank Miles', 'Frank Miles Is A Reporter', 'Editor Covering Geopolitics', 'Military', 'Crime', 'Technology', 'Sports For Foxnews.Com. His Email Is Frank.Miles Foxnews.Com.']","A dramatic undercover video shows that a recent trophy-hunting convention is still promoting trips to shoot captive-bred lions in Africa, despite previous public assurances its practices had been stopped, according to a report.

Animal welfare activists for the Humane Society of the United States captured the footage last week at the annual convention of Safari Club International (SCI) in Reno, Nevada.

SCI is among the nation’s largest trophy-hunting groups and its yearly gatherings typically draw thousands of attendees and hundreds of vendors selling firearms, overseas safari trips and items made from the skins and bones of rare wildlife.

In the video, captured by the humane society last week, tour operators said the lions for sale were bred in captivity. Typically, the lions are raised in cages and small pens before being released into a larger fenced enclosure. Once reaching young adulthood, customers pay to shoot them and keep the skins, skulls, claws and other body parts for trophies.

“They’re bred in captivity. They’re born in captivity, and then they’re released,” a salesman for Bush Africa Safaris, a South African tour operator, says in the video. “There’s guys who are going to tell you something different on the floor, they’re going to bulls--t you, that is what it is.”

Salesmen from two other safari operators also confirmed they had captive-bred lions for sale, including advertising a ""bargain rate"" of $8,000 for a ranch in South Africa.

Multi-day safaris for hunting wild lions can easily cost 10 times that -- money that hunting advocates say helps support anti-poaching and conservation efforts in cash-strapped African nations.

“Canned lion hunts have no conservation value and are unethical,” said Kitty Block, president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States. “Lions bred for the sole purpose of being hunted for a trophy is an industry built on a conveyor belt of exploitation and animal cruelty.”

In 2018, SCI issued a policy opposing the hunting of African lions bred in captivity, which the group said is of doubtful value to the conservation of lions in the wild. After the humane society captured video of canned hunts being sold at the SCI convention last year, SCI issued a statement pledging not to accept advertising from any operator selling such hunts, nor allow their sale in the vendor booths rented out at its annual convention.

In a statement Wednesday, SCI said its policy against captive-bred hunts had not changed and that it would investigate the issue.

“Safari Club International (SCI) proudly supports the right to hunt; however, SCI does not condone the practice of canned hunting by our members, outfitters, or other partners,” said Robert Brooks, a spokesman for the group. “As sportsmen, we believe hunting is best enjoyed when certain fair chase criteria are met.”

Schalk and Terina van Heerden, the owners of Bush Africa Safaris in Ellisras, South Africa, did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press seeking comment.

“This convention does nothing other than celebrate senseless violence toward wildlife,” Block said about big-game hunting. “Wild animals are not commodities to be sold, with their deaths something to celebrate. This needs to end.”

In addition to the canned hunts on offer, vendors at the SCI convention were advertising a $350,000 hunt for a critically endangered black rhino in Namibia and $35,000 for a guided polar bear hunt in Canada.

83,"People think ‘butter’ made from insects tastes as good as the real thing, study claims",['Michael Hollan'],"This is not the future we were promised.

A new study suggests that the future of butter might be insects. The results show that butter made from insect fat might not just be healthier, but people may actually like the taste of it.

Researchers at Ghent University in Belgium studied whether or not taste testers could tell the difference between food items made with traditional butter and ones that used insect fat. To achieve this, they made three versions of each item: one with regular butter, one made with a quarter of the butter replaced with insect fat, and a version where half the butter was replaced.

According to the results of the study, taste testers could not tell the difference between regular cake and cake with a quarter of insect fat (made from the larvae of black soldier flies). They also served taste testers waffles, and they could not tell the difference between any of the three versions.

In their published results, researcher Daylan Tzompa-Sosa explained, “The ecological footprint of an insect is much smaller compared to animal-based food sources. Besides, we can grow insects in large quantities in Europe, which also reduces the footprint of transport. After all, palm fat is often imported from outside of Europe.”

Aside from the ecological benefits, Tzompa-Sosa explained that insect fat may be healthier for humans.

“Insect fat is a different type of fat than butter,” he said. “Insect fat contains lauric acid, which provides positive nutritional attributes since it is more digestible than butter. Moreover, lauric acid has an antibacterial, antimicrobial and antimycotic effect. This means that it is able, for example, to eliminate harmless various viruses, bacteria or even fungi in the body, allowing it to have a positive effect on health.”",https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/insect-fat-butter-taste-healthy-alternative
84,Three farmers hit back at Mike Bloomberg: 'absolutely outraged and disheartened',"['Julia Musto', 'Julia Musto Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com']","Farmers are blasting 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg after a newly surfaced video revealed some dismissive comments about farmers and their industry.

Speaking at London's Oxford University in November of 2016, Bloomberg told a crowd that he could ""teach anybody to be a farmer.""

""It's a process. You dig a hole, put a seed in, put dirt on top, add water, up comes the corn,"" he said flippantly.

Three American farmers joined ""Fox & Friends"" Tuesday to give their reactions.

Sizemore Farms co-owner John Sizemore said he was ""amazed at Bloomberg's ignorance"" of the industry.

""I was absolutely outraged and disheartened that Bloomberg could be so out of touch with American farmers,"" fourth-generation farmer Mary Blackmon chimed in.

""Well, I think it's quite absurd considering the man probably couldn't drop a quarter in a bubblegum machine and get something out – much less a seed core,"" joked soybean farmer Sid Rodgers.

This is not the first time Bloomberg's past has come back to haunt him in the last few weeks. Critics also assailed the three-term former New York City mayor over unearthed comments toward women and previous interviews on his controversial stop-and-frisk policy.

Bloomberg qualified for Wednesday's presidential primary debate in Nevada at the last minute, notching 19 percent support in a Marist, Newshour and NPR/PBS poll, the fourth national poll to put him above the 10 percent mark since Jan. 15. That means the billionaire, who has spent more than $400 million of his fortune on advertising, meets the polling threshold set by the Democratic National Committee for the debate.

""Listen, farmers have been innovative people all their life,"" Rodgers responded. ""They have to be well-versed in multiple occupations from welding and fabricating to electrical, plumbing, being a vet ... we have to be masters of GPS, soil science, weather, marketing – in order to stay alive.""

""It takes a strategy – a very well-informed, detailed strategy on every single aspect from financing to your seed selection to your planting to what tractors and machinery you are going to use,"" Blackmon added.

""There are so many details that have to go into it and then all of it can turn on a dime and you can lose everything in the blink of an eye.""

86,"Growing number of Americans spend 30 percent or more of income on rent, Harvard report claims","['Janine Puhak', 'Janine Puhak Is An Editor For Fox News Lifestyle. Follow Her On Twitter At']","There’s no place like home – though renters feeling house poor might not be alone in the neighborhood with the worry, a new Harvard report has claimed.

A study published in January by the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University has claimed that 20.8 million American renter households were “cost burdened,” spending 30 percent of their income on housing expenses such as rent and utilities in 2018. Comparatively, there were 6 million more cost-burdened renters in 2018 than in 2001.

Of the larger group, 10.9 million renters were reported as “severely burdened,” shelling out over 50 percent of their income on housing in 2018.

KIM KARDASHIAN, KANYE WEST SHARE GLIMPSE OF MINIMALIST LA MANSION, INSTAGRAM REACTS: 'HORROR MOVIE MATERIAL'

“When we talk about cost burden, this could be the new normal,” Whitney Airgood-Obrycki, the study’s lead author, told Reuters.

According to the outlet, cost-burdened renters reside in urban and rural areas alike, with the issue “disproportionately” affecting minorities.

Though unemployment is at its lowest level in decades, “the share of middle-income renters paying more than 30 percent of income for housing has steadily risen,” the researchers said. The trend is most apparent in large metropolitan areas with a high cost of living.

FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS

The study cites multiple factors that have created difficulties for Americans to afford their rental housing in recent years, like a growing demand from high-income Americans for rental units. For example, households with incomes of $75,000 and up drove three-quarters of rental growth, at 3.2 million from 2010 to 2018, the report said.

“As a result, construction activity has concentrated on the upper end of the market, with builders focusing on building amenity-rich apartment buildings in popular neighborhoods designed to appeal to this higher-income renter,” MarketWatch explained. “Institutional investors have also bought up a larger share of the country’s rental housing stock, renovating many of these units in order to convert them into properties that can charge a higher rent.”

The Harvard study argues that this has contributed to the country’s number of more affordable rentals to shrink – fast.

Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West have shared a rare glimpse of their famously minimalist Los Angeles mansion – though social media commenters remain divided regarding whether the austere space is “gorgeous” or “horror movie material creepy.”

On Monday, Architectural Digest released its March 2020 cover and accompanying interview with the power couple, highlighting the monochromatic Calabasas home they share with their four young children.

Kardashian West described the coveted magazine feature as “something I have always dreamed of” and shared images of her beige, cream and gray color-schemed home on Instagram.

With bare-bones furnishings and a spartan aesthetic throughout, shots of the West family home included a white sweeping staircase, white living room, window seat with a wooden table and airy views of greenery, a simple office with a wooden desk and two statue heads, plus a grand, white, empty hallway. Pops of color emerged in the spacious backyard pool and all-pink bedroom of daughter North, 6, complete with an oversized butterfly headboard.

Of course, Instagram commenters had a whole lot to say about Kimye’s unique digs.

Some fans gushed over the stark style as “gorgeous” and “stunning,” swooning over the “clean and modern” vibes.

Critics, meanwhile, were more skeptical of the empty ethos, with one going so far as to declare it was the “scariest home ever.”

90,"Walking 10,000 steps each day won't aid with weight loss, study suggests",['Michael Bartiromo'],"We may have been too foolish to believe that mere walking would be the answer to our weight problems.

A recent study from Brigham Young University suggests that the mere act of walking — specifically, walking between 10,000 and 15,000 steps per day — was not enough to prevent weight gain among the 120 freshmen students who took part in the research.

MAN, 91, BECOMES INTERNET SENSATION FOR WORKING OUT IN OVERALLS

Researchers determined the results by dividing the students into three groups, and instructing them to walk 10,000, 12,500 or 15,000 steps (respectively) for six days per week over the course of 24 weeks.

In the end, the study’s authors observed that the increased step counts were not enough to prevent the students from gaining an average of 3.5 pounds over the 24-week period. (The researchers cited previous studies that suggested college students “commonly” gain between 2 and 9 pounds in their first year at school.)

“Exercise alone is not always the most effective way to lose weight,” lead author Bruce Bailey, the professor of exercise science at BYU, said in a summary posted to the university’s website. “If you track steps, it might have a benefit in increasing physical activity, but our study showed it won’t translate into maintaining weight or preventing weight gain.”

However, Bailey was quick to add that the increased step counts did have benefits, albeit not necessarily when it came to the students’ waistbands. BYU researchers cited a study authored by a professor at Harvard Medical School who observed that mortality rates decreased among those who took more steps (although those rates “leveled off” once a subject reached 7,500 steps). The BYU study's authors also observed an across-the-board reduction in sedentary time, which they suggested could have added physical and emotional benefits.

Her First Book']","The world is obsessed with digital health technology.

Each month a new digital tech app or device is promoted as the latest and greatest, yet it leaves many confused.

Wearable health tech (Apple watch, FitBits, etc.) can alert us about sleeping patterns, whether we are moving enough or even if our heart is beating appropriately.

DR. NICOLE SAPHIER: SKIPPING BREAKFAST COULD BE THE GREATEST THING YOU DO IN 2020

If an alert pops up telling you that you have been sedentary for far too long, then the motivation for increased physical activity and engagement can help prevent disease and improve overall well-being.

Unless you are completely disconnected from television and social media then you have heard about some of the activity trackers and the 10,000-steps-a-day goal.

Hundreds of wearable gadgets promise a healthier lifestyle, but results vary whether they work and it’s easy to get lost in the jungle of digital health technology.

And… if you are like me, you already are behind in the technology arena so the chances of you buying the latest and greatest device every time it is announced is slim to none.

So, whether you use a digital activity tracker or a simple pedometer is 10,000 daily steps a good goal for you?

The reason you should consider setting a step goal is that walking is a form of exercise that's available to most people. In fact, walking and/or any other regular activity can help reduce your risk of many common health problems such as:

Heart disease

Cancer

Obesity

Diabetes

High blood pressure

Depression

The average American walks roughly 3,500 steps a day which is about 1.5 to 2 miles. -- That's well below the 10,000-step goal. Perhaps this is why Americans lead the world in obesity and sedentary lifestyles.

It's a good idea to find out how many steps a day you walk on average each day because you may be walking more (or less) than you think.

Once you know how many steps a day you are walking then you can work up toward the goal of 10,000 steps by aiming to add extra steps a day every two weeks.

If you are already at the 10,000-step mark, then you can still try to increase your total because adding any more regular activity to your routine is still going to be beneficial to your health.

If you don’t like the idea of wearable tech and have no plans to count your steps, then a good starting goal is to try to get in at least 150 minutes a week of moderate activity.

The 150 minutes a week can be broken down in many ways so don’t think you have to stop everything for a 2.5 hour work out.

Some people try to do 30 minutes of activity five days a week while other do shorter sessions several times a day because of time restrictions.

My day is typically filled with a full day of work at the hospital seeing patients coupled with caring for three children and an occasional TV appearance. Needless to say, there is limited time for me to get to the gym or attend a workout class.

Since brisk walking fits into the “moderate activity” recommendations by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, getting my steps in is crucial with my time limitations.

Twice daily I take a walk with my colleague around the perimeter of our 120,000 square foot building, which is about 1.2 miles per day.

Although that sounds like a lot, there really are only about 2,500 steps in those walks! To further increase my daily steps, I park farther from the building, use the stairs and drink water constantly throughout the day (which not only keeps me hydrated but makes sure I am walking to and from the bathroom often).

My routine may not be perfect, but I am conscious in my efforts to move more daily in addition to a healthy diet that involves intermittent fasting and increased raw fruits and vegetables.

Here is the reality, if you don’t want to be tasked to count steps or wear a tech device to remind you when you need more activity, just move more!

Find forms of activity you enjoy and incorporate it into your daily routine. Even if your walking pace isn't quick enough to be considered “moderate-intensity,” those steps still help prevent health problems that can occur from sitting too long and a sedentary lifestyle.

Last month, Lloyd Black’s uplifting story went viral on Facebook when his local Anytime Fitness gym honored him as “member of the month.” Black, an Air Force veteran and retired school principal, said he was inspired to join the Semmes branch of the fitness chain one year ago after daily tasks became difficult. In the months since, the nonagenarian has become a cherished member of the exercise community for his upbeat attitude and commitment to his thrice-weekly workouts, Fox 5 reports.

Determined to progress, Black now enjoys 30-minute treadmill walks, leg presses and upper-body machines, which he’s cited as improving his strength and balance.

“It just improves the way you feel,” he explained.

Ashley Seaman, the gym’s general manager, said that Black is her facility’s oldest member and that his positive attitude impresses many.

“He’s always laughing and telling a joke,” she told AL.com.

URBAN OUTFITTERS' 'VINTAGE' US NAVY COVERALLS SPARK ONLINE OUTRAGE

The seamstress said she first learned to sew by sitting on the floor of her aunt’s studio in Puerto Rico, watching her create beautiful pieces.

“Every summer I would fly to Puerto Rico to spend the summer with my dad. My aunt was a seamstress who had a studio. And I would sit on her studio floor and watch her turn these fabrics into incredible bridal gowns,” Mimi said.

When Mimi turned 12, her father bought her a sewing machine and had it shipped to Chicago, where Mimi was living with her mother. There, she began to teach herself how to sew by “dismantling clothes” she owned and then sewing them back together.

Despite having the desire – and the equipment – to pursue sewing, Mimi said what encouraged her to continue pursuing her creative outlet all came down to one moment.

“I volunteered to make my mother’s dress for a wedding she had to go to when I was about 13. I made her this dress, it was awful. It had a crooked hemline and neckline. It was fitting off at certain areas of her body,” Mimi reflected on her first design.

“But she wore it anyway,” she continued. “And bragged that ‘My daughter made me this.’ That small moment I had with my mom really encouraged me to continue sewing.”

Mimi’s life took a turn in her teens, and she found herself a homeless teenage mother in Los Angeles — and disconnected from her first love of sewing.

“Coming from sexual abuse, being a teen runaway, homeless, survivor of domestic violence — I found sewing as an outlet. It was very therapeutic for me,” she said. — Mimi G

Eventually, Mimi managed to get back on her feet, working full time in film and production, and commuting three hours to work to support her family. However, as the sole breadwinner, Mimi was still struggling to make ends meet and often found herself feeling lost.

“I found myself in a place where a lot of moms find themselves — feeling like something was missing. I would go home and have mini breakdowns, gather myself and then go make dinner,” she said.

During one of her lows, Mimi said she was browsing the Internet and learned about bloggers who posted about sewing.

“This was 2008, and I thought, ‘What’s a blog?’” she said.

Seeing as she was bored of her job and in search of an outlet, Mimi decided to start her own blog about sewing and her life. She kept up with the blog on and off for about a year before retiring it all together.

Years passed. Mimi still thought about that blog, however, and ultimately decided to start it up again. But this time, consistently.

“In 2012, I decided to make myself accountable for something for the year. So almost every day, I posted on my blog about sewing tips, patterns and how to DIY designer garment looks.”

Within a year, she had 1 million page views. Within a year and a half, she quit her day job.

“What set me apart was that my patterns were more fashion-forward. It appealed to people who wanted to sew fashion garments,” she said. “A lot of other sewing blogs are for making baby clothes or quilts. There aren’t a lot of resources for people who want to make actual fashionable clothes.”

“I felt a sense of responsibility to create a community that was safe and would allow these people to come together and inspire and motivate each other to create and heal.” — Mimi G

Using her eye for design and seamstress background, Mimi put up clothes people were drawn to — and her site traffic steadily reflected that. And then one particular skirt changed everything.

“I put up a skirt, and it went viral,” she said.

The design was soon shared all over social media, bringing tons of people to her website, along with many commission requests. Mimi says she wasn’t interested in sewing for hire, though, and continued to keep up with her blog.

Then Christmas rolled around and Mimi decided to take some orders to make some cash.

“I put the skirt up on my blog for 24 hours and I priced it high. I set it at $250 for 24 hours, and I would only do requests that came in within that time,” she said. “Within a day I had 40 requests.”

The mom of four was blown away by the interest. And then it sunk in that she had to make all the skirts.

“Everyone was helping,” Mimi said of her family. Fortunately, all of the orders were filled and shipped on time.

But this incredible feat sparked another idea for Mimi.

“I decided I was never going to do that again,” she laughed. “So I decided to teach others how to make the skirt instead.”

That led to her first step-by-step video tutorial — of which she sold downloads to kick-start her business. This soon led her to create the world’s No. 1 online sewing school, SewItAcademy, where subscribers can take different classes based on skill level and receive a detailed new course every month. They also get answers to their questions, such as the most asked of all: What sewing machine do I get? (Mimi uses a Baby Lock Destiny, the “Ferrari of sewing machines.”)

But while Mimi admits that her fashion-forward style is what has captured her students’ interests, she says she also meets them on a personal level.

“Coming from sexual abuse, being a teen runaway, homeless, survivor of domestic violence — I found sewing as an outlet. It was very therapeutic for me,” she said.

Her message of “helping people see beyond their circumstance” has deeply resonated with others.

“People have been reaching out to share their stories with me and [tell me] how I had helped them overcome things,” she said.

“I felt a sense of responsibility to create a community that was safe and would allow these people to come together and inspire and motivate each other to create and heal.”

97,180 coronavirus evacuees released from Travis Air Force Base after quarantine,['Alexandria Hein'],"Officials said 180 coronavirus evacuees who were flown to Travis Air Force Base in Solano County, Calif., earlier this month were released on Tuesday following the completion of their 14-day quarantine. The evacuees, who arrived from Wuhan, China, have “been medically cleared,” and “pose no health risk” to the surrounding community, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said.

Their release comes on the same day that another group that was being housed at Miramar Marine Corps Air Station in San Diego was sent home. The two groups had arrived to the U.S. on State Department-chartered flights from Wuhan, which is considered the coronavirus epicenter.

“Later this week, all remaining people recently returned from Wuhan, China, via State Department-chartered flights are anticipated to complete their 14-day quarantine,” the CDC press release said.

The health agency noted that newly arrived evacuees who were flown to the base from Japan after they were removed from the Diamond Princess cruise ship have been kept separate from the other quarantined groups.

Russia only has three confirmed cases of the COVID-19 disease caused by the virus. Two Chinese citizens were treated and a Russian national became infected aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan.

The suspension adds Russia to the list of nations taking precautionary measures to protect its citizens. It has also halted air traffic and trains to China and closed its land border with China and Mongolia.

It also stopped issuing temporary work visas to Chinese citizens and told Chinese students who have been studying in Russia to not return until March 1.

The majority of deaths linked to the virus have occurred in China, particularly in the Hubei province where it was first reported in December. Chinese authorities have locked down cities and halted public transportation and public services as health officials scramble to contain the illness.

100,Class ring lost in Maine 47 years ago is found buried in forest in Finland,['Stephen Sorace'],"A high school class ring lost in Maine in 1973 has been found buried beneath a forest floor in Finland and returned to its owner, who says the unlikely find might be more than just a coincidence.

Debra McKenna, 63, lost the Morse High School ring in a Portland department store shortly after her then-boyfriend and future husband, Shawn, gave it to her when he left for college.

CALIFORNIA POLICE FIND 106-YEAR-OLD VET'S CLASSIC CADILLAC, GIFTED BY RITA HAYWORTH, AFTER THIEVES STEAL IT

The couple was married for 40 years until Shawn died in 2017 after a six-year battle with cancer.

The ring, however, was largely forgotten until a sheet metal worker found it under 8 inches of soil in a Finnish forest last month after 47 years. The story of how the ring journeyed nearly 4,000 miles from Maine to Finland remains a mystery.

Marko Saarinen was using his metal detector in a city park in Kaarina, a small town in southwest Finland, when he dug up the blue-stoned, silver ring, according to Finnish news outlet Ilta-Sanomat. He said he usually only finds “bottle caps or other junk” and was surprised the ring had come from the U.S.

The markings on the ring, including the initials S.M., helped Saarinen track down the owner.

McKenna said she cried when the ring arrived in the mail at her Brunswick home last week.

“It’s very touching in this world of negativity, to have decent people step forward and make an effort,” McKenna told the Bangor Daily News. “There are good people in the world, and we need more of them.”

McKenna believes the sudden discovery of the ring may be a message from her late husband.

Follow Her On Twitter']","A New Jersey FedEx driver who picked up and folded an American flag that he spotted on the ground as he was driving by appeared on “Fox & Friends Weekend” on Sunday and said when it comes to the American flag, “You have to do something whether people are watching or not.”

Chris Oslovich’s simple act of patriotism was caught on a Ring camera at a Freehold, N.J., home and the homeowner, Rick Guerino Jr., said he got an alert from his Ring doorbell camera that someone was near his home and that is when he caught the FedEx driver in action, Fox 35 News reported.

He posted the video on Facebook, where it has been shared nearly 6,000 times.

Speaking on “Fox & Friends Weekend” on Sunday, Oslovich, who wasn’t even delivering a package to the home where he noticed the flag on the ground, said he stopped to pick it up because “when you see the flag on the ground, that’s a sign of disrespect.”

“The flag should never be desecrated like that so you have to stop, you have to do something whether people are watching or not,” he continued.

He also acknowledged that, “Usually when you see something that you know isn’t right, some people just think nothing of it, somebody else would do it and they just keep on going by.”

In this case, especially because the item on the ground was an American flag, he said he just had to do something.

Guerino reportedly said that as he watched the footage, he saw the FedEx driver pick up his American flag from his front yard after the pole had been knocked down in the heavy wind. Guerino, who put the flag pole up after 9/11, said he then saw the employee unhook the flag from the pole, fold it up the proper way, and place it on Guerino’s porch, Fox 35 reported.

“I really appreciated what he did, his patriotism,” Guerino reportedly said. “You don’t see things like that anymore.”

Oslovich’s father was a 9/11 first responder. Speaking on “Fox & Friends Weekend” Oslovich said that he is considering going into law enforcement as well.

When host Pete Hegseth asked Oslovich if he had his father and men like him in mind when he stopped to fold the flag he answered, “They’re the people that I look up to and I always have.”

When asked how he learned to fold the flag, Oslovich said, “It just felt natural to do it.”

He added that he also “thought about the first time I have ever done it, just watching flag-folding ceremonies or even the flag that my father has, which is folded.”

“So I guess from that original experience it was just locked away in my head,” he continued.

104,Wounded veteran Noah Galloway: 'I was prepared to die. I wasn't prepared for the in-between',['Matt London'],"Wounded Army veteran, motivational speaker and author Sgt. Noah Galloway opened up about his battle to overcome devastating physical injuries sustained on the battlefield in Iraq and the lingering mental health issues that he confronted after returning home.

""I always encourage people to get mental health ... we thought that admitting that you needed help was weakness,"" he said, ""Now I see it as, after going through five years of depression, letting that darkness take over ... that's weakness. It takes real strength to stand up and get help. It took me five years.""

The decorated, double-amputee war veteran spoke with Fox Nation host John Rich on ""The Pursuit! with John Rich"" about patriotism, challenges and determination.

""The whole idea for this show... is the Constitution does not guarantee us happiness. It guarantees us the right to pursue happiness,"" said Rich. ""It's what we call the American dream. You know why we call it the American dream? Because it is limitless and we all have a right to it. And it's secured by our veterans and our active-duty military personnel -- period.""

Galloway was first introduced to millions of Americans in 2016 when he competed on the reality TV show ""Dancing with the Stars."" A few years before that, he was featured on the cover of ""Men's Health"" magazine and dubbed the ""Ultimate"" guy. But his road to celebrity was anything but glamorous.

Three months into his second tour of duty in Iraq, the Humvee that he was driving was hit by an improvised explosive device.

""I went into Iraq -- two deployments -- with the mindset that I might die,"" Galloway told Rich. ""I'm going to either retire an old man in the military or I'm going to die in combat. And I was fine with either one of those options.""

However, he said he was not prepared for a third option.

The force of the IED blast that hit his Humvee threw the 9,000-pound armored vehicle into the air, across a dirt road and into a water-filled canal.

""I don't remember any of it,"" he told Rich. ""They said the water was up to my chest. Arm was already taken off. Injuries all over my body.""

Galloway was transported from the battlefield to Baghdad, then to Germany and eventually to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington D.C., where we regained consciousness for the first time since the attack. It was Christmas Day.

VETERAN, FOX NEWS CO-HOST PETE HEGSETH ON RETURNING FROM WAR TO 'COUNTRY THAT MOSTLY DOESN'T GIVE A S---'

""I ... wake up six days later in a hospital unaware what happened and two of my limbs are gone, injuries to my right leg, my right hand, my jaw was shattered, my mouth was wired shut. I was prepared to die. I wasn't prepared for the in-between.""

Under heavy sedation, Galloway had to be informed that he was missing his left arm above the elbow and left leg above the knee.

""When I was told, it, oh, it broke me,"" he told Rich. ""I would go through one phase of crying like a baby to just angry, yelling at anybody that wanted to help me ... it was one emotion after another.""

Galloway said that he fell into a depression that lasted five years.

""To be brutally honest, for about five years I was not the person I am today or who I was before I got injured,"" he said.

But then, one day, he explained that he came to a realization that set him on a path to rehabilitation.

""It was actually one day I walked into my living room and my three kids ... were sitting on the couch watching TV,"" he remembered. ""All of a sudden, I realize, to my two boys, I'm showing them what a man is. And that's what they're gonna become one day.""

""And to my little girl, I'm showing her how a man is supposed to act and that's what she's going to look for one day,"" he continued. ""And, the man I was, I did not want my boys to be or my daughter to find. So I knew I had to make a change.""

""Now I always tell people life is not a movie. I didn't just fix it right then. I still make mistakes. But every time I screwed up, and fell flat on my face, it was the thought of my three kids that motivated me to get up and push hard,"" Galloway said. ""I owe everything to my three kids to who I am today after my injury.""

105,"Donald Stratton, Pearl Harbor survivor who fought for recognition of hero sailor, dead at 97","['Mike Arroyo', 'Mike Arroyo Is A Senior Editor For']","Donald Stratton, one of the last USS Arizona survivors from Pearl Harbor who fought for the recognition of one of his heroic shipmates, died Saturday night in his sleep, his granddaughter told Fox News.

Stratton died of natural causes in Colorado Springs, Colo., his family said. He was 97.

The Navy veteran said it wasn't until 2001, during a reunion of Pearl Harbor survivors, that he discovered the identity of the U.S. service member who saved his life and the lives of at least five other sailors: Chief Petty Officer Joe George, who died in 1996.

Stratton and Lauren Bruner, another Arizona survivor, lobbied hard for George to be recognized. Both traveled to Washington, D.C., in 2017 to meet President Trump in the White House and then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis at the Pentagon.

Stratton said he and others trapped aboard the sinking Arizona had struggled mightily to escape the carnage, which killed 1,177 of his shipmates, after Japanese planes struck the Arizona several times on Dec. 7, 1941. ""We got hit with the big bomb and that exploded like a million pounds of ammunition. The fireball went about 60, 70 feet in the air.""

He said George threw them a lifeline from his own ship, which was moored next to the Arizona.

""We proceeded to go hand over hand across the line about 70 feet"" off the burning warship, Stratton said, adding that the toughest part was reaching the middle of the sagging line stretched across two ships, and climbing up to the other ship.

Still, George ""kept saying, 'Come on sailor! You can make it,'"" Stratton recalled. The attack left Stratton with burns over 60 percent of his body, costing him his fingerprints and leaving permanent scars.

PEARL HARBOR HERO RECOGNIZED 76 YEARS AFTER SAVING 6 FROM SINKING USS ARIZONA

Recollections from George himself ultimately emerged; he spoke to the University of North Texas in 1978 for an oral history documenting the attack. There were ""people over on the Arizona that were trying to get off, and there was fire all around,"" he said. ""I threw a line over.""

Later in 2017, the Navy finally awarded George a posthumous Bronze Star with valor, an award many of his supporters said was long overdue.

""I was aboard the USS Arizona on the morning of December 7, 1941. The courage I saw in our men was astonishing,"" Stratton wrote in his 2016 book, ""All the Gallant Men."" ""Acts of individual heroism could be witnessed everywhere you looked. Men being strafed as they brought boxes of ammo up ladders to the antiaircraft guns. Other men carrying their wounded buddies to safety, trying desperately to stanch their bleeding. Still others in small boats, navigating through the fiery sea, pulling oil-soaked sailors from the water. Many putting out fires on board their ships. All the while these men were dodging enemy bullets that were cutting everything around them to shreds, including their fellow sailors.""

Soto and Brown met the ""millennial way"" on a dating website for singles called ""Plenty of Fish.""

Brown told ""Fox & Friends"" hosts Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt, and Brian Kilmeade that they were both a ""little hesitant"" at first because they feared the dreaded phishing scams that often goes hand-in-hand with dating websites and apps.

However, they both took a leap of faith and met for lunch. That night, they met again for dinner. Six years later, Brown said that they have been ""inseparable ever since.""

Soto, who served in the National Guard in 2001 after the September 11 attacks, said that she was stationed ""where Saddam [Hussein] pretty much lived.""

""We used to get mortared all the time,"" she added.

She told the audience that it was really hard for her to connect with people who were not from a military background because they didn't understand it.

But Brown was a military brat born in Berlin, Germany. He said that while he didn't want to go that route, he understood the struggle that servicemembers go through and the passion that they have for the country.

""If we're watching football games at home, we have to stand for the national anthem,"" he said, prompting applause from the audience.

Brown and Soto's wedding on the ""Fox & Friends"" set was beautiful and elegant. Soto glided down through the studio doors and down the aisle in time to Bright Eyes' ""First Day of My Life."" She wore a classic, strapless, white, mermaid dress with a sweetheart neckline. A long, sheer veil trailed down her back.

Brown wore a traditional black suit, black tie, and a white rose boutonniere. The bridesmaids dressed in burgundy.

107,Fox News' Pete Hegseth opens up about post-traumatic stress after Iraq deployment,"['Matt London', 'Fox News Co-Host Pete Hegseth']","In a new episode of Fox Nation's ""Nuff Said with Tyrus,"" decorated Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran and Fox News co-host Pete Hegseth opened up about the challenges facing America's veterans and his own experience transitioning from military to civilian life.

Hegseth earned his Army commission in Princeton University's Reserve Officers' Training Corps. After graduation, a short stint as an investment banker and a deployment to Guantanamo Bay, the Minnesota native volunteered to go to Iraq following the Sept. 11 attacks.

He described that time as one of the most significant in his life for its ""depth of purpose,"" ""commitment"" and ""simplicity.""

""You're locked on a base. ... The ability to BS is a special skill set,"" he said, joking about the monotony of military life in a war zone.

""But then, one hour later, you're rolling out the gate, not knowing whether you're going to hit an IED or whether that target you're going to is going to be a live one or not,"" he told Tyrus.

""There's something raw and real about human nature that changes you when you see it right in front of your face – when you see life and death,"" he remembered, ""You're working with people there whose lives are on the line, Al-Qaeda's targeting them, you get a chance to help them and help them improve their lives.""

Hegseth said those experiences changed him forever, ""The raw humanity of those moments make it hard to come back and hear about stupid s---.""

""I didn't adjust. I don't know that I have fully,"" he said, reflecting on returning home after his deployment. ""I spent a lot of time drinking and laying on the couch.""

""You're still processing the fact that a week earlier everything you were doing mattered and was consequential. ... All the people you shared these memories with, you might see them in a year at a reunion. And then you're looking around at a country that mostly doesn't give a s---.""

""I'm sure I was a mess... I didn't talk about things like post-traumatic stress and all that. I definitely had it."" — Fox News co-host Pete Hegseth

""I'm sure I was a mess... I didn't talk about things like post-traumatic stress and all that. I definitely had it,"" he told Tyrus. ""I don't call it PTSD because I don't think you live with a disorder all the time – not everyone does. ... I don't live with the disorder today, but I definitely had that.""

After Iraq, Hegseth started a job with a conservative think tank, the Manhattan Institute.

And then, he said, his life changed again. ""I quickly ran into a group called Vets for Freedom, which is an Iraq War vet group. And they were fighting to basically win the war and have the backs of the guys still pulling triggers.""

Within a year, Hegseth was on Capitol Hill, leading a group of veterans lobbying Congress to support an increase of troops in Iraq. The 2007 Iraq troop surge would be widely credited with turning the tide of the conflict.

Soon Hegseth went back to the battlefield again, volunteering to deploy to Afghanistan in 2011 after President Barack Obama ordered a surge of U.S. troops to that country.

In 2013, he was home and enrolled in the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, where he earned a master’s degree in public policy. That would eventually lead to a position as CEO of Concerned Veterans for America.

Hegseth has continued his focus on veterans' issues on Fox News and Fox Nation. In Fox Nation's ""Modern Warriors: Medal of Honor Special"", he interviewed Medal of Honor recipient David Bellavia, who was presented with the nation's highest military honor for his actions as a squad leader during the second Battle of Fallujah, making Bellavia the first living Iraq War veteran to receive the recognition.

Hegseth attributed his ability to navigate his career, in part, to his upbringing and the opportunities that he has been afforded. And he said that also forces him to consider those veterans who do not have as many options.

""I think about the E-5 and the staff sergeants ... they were the guys you needed at every moment,"" he said. ""When you're in Iraq and you're the [squad automatic weapon] gunner, you're an important man and your ability to reload, disassemble that weapon, put it back together, understand how to build a sector of fire ... that's super important. And the minute you come home and that rifle comes out of your hand, now you're just Joe Blow from next door, mowing his lawn.""

Hegseth suggested that it is up to American society to better recognize and address the challenges facing our veterans. ""If you're not intentional about finding ways for guys to rebuild that purpose, then you go down the dark road of veteran suicide or dependency or addiction.""

""For me, it was finding another sense of purpose and that's what I always try to share with guys,"" he concluded. ""Whatever you're passionate about ... go after that passion, because that's, I think, when you'll feel the spark of life that you don't feel.""

108,"Fallen Jewish American World War ll soldiers, POWs finally to be buried under Star of David","['Hollie Mckay', 'Hollie Mckay Has A Been A Fox News Digital Staff Reporter Since She Has Extensively Reported War Zones Including Iraq', 'Syria', 'Yemen', 'Afghanistan', 'Pakistan', 'Burma', 'Latin America Investigates Global Conflicts', 'War Crimes', 'Terrorism Around The World. Follow Her On']","Some 75 years later – after a series of recent serendipitous moments and intensive research – five fallen Jewish American soldiers from World War II finally will be buried beneath a Star of David.

The unique re-naming ceremony is slated to take place in Manilla, Philippines, on Wednesday – coordinated by the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC) and the founders of Operation Benjamin. The Latin cross headstones adorning the graves of five U.S. soldiers buried in the Manila American Cemetery and Memorial will be replaced with the Star of David.

“We wanted to bring truth to the historical record. Amid a time of rising anti-semitism, it is important that when someone visits the cemetery that they see the physical manifestation of the Jewish men who bled and fought and died for the United States,” Operation Benjamin founder Shalom Lamm told Fox News. “The symbolism is important; these were people who were born as Jews, lived as Jews, and died as Jews. That heritage was important to them and their families.”

ANCIENT CHRISTIAN RUINS DISCOVERED UNDER FORMER ISIS-HELD TERRITORY

There are numerous reasons why a Jewish service member during the Second World War may not have been recognized as such on initial and then permanent burial – everything from clerical errors to personal omission to reduce the risk of persecution should they be captured by the enemy.

Often, Jewish soldiers had to quickly deface the “H” for Hebrew on their “dog tags” so as to not make themselves susceptible to Nazi targeting. On other occasions, it was a miscalculation that can only be contributed to the fog of war, the chaos and confusion, or because loved ones left behind did not have the money or means to correct the mistake.

Representatives of four of the five fallen will take part in the historic ceremony, along with blessings from the U.S. and Israel ambassadors to the Philippines. Together they intend to recite the Mourner’s Kaddish at each of the graves, Lamm said.

“May His Great Name be blessed forever and to all eternity,” the hymn goes. “Blessed and praised, glorified, exalted and extolled, honored, adored and lauded be the Name of the Holy One, blessed be He.”

So, who were the fallen?

Philadelphia-born Pvt. Louis Wolf was 25 when he died on March 19, 1945. He had been taken prisoner by the Japanese and died of dehydration. Pvt. Arthur Waldman, who hailed from Michigan, died in early 1944 after enduring the infamous Bataan Death March, succumbing to beriberi heart failure – often associated with starvation – at a Japanese POW camp in Tokyo.

Then there is 1st Lt. Robert S. Fink, from New York, who died on his 25th birthday in 1944 from scrub typhus at the 2nd Station Hospital in Papua New Guinea. Connecticut native Pvt. Allan C. Franken – at just 20 years old – was killed by a gunshot in the Philippines on April 14, 1941.

And lastly, Polish-born U.S. immigrant Sgt. Jack Gilbert was 37 when he was hit by enemy shell fire on the island of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea in February 1942.

“It is ABMC’s mission to ensure that the stories of the service members we are entrusted with live on in perpetuity. It is so important that those stories be told in truth,” noted Alison Bettencourt, a spokesperson for the commission. “It’s truly an honor to be able to correct those errors and to ensure that, moving forward, these service members will be remembered as who they were – Jewish American patriots who sacrificed all so that tyranny never reached our shores.”

The idea of Operation Benjamin was first sparked in 2014, as Harvard-trained historian Rabbi JJ Schacter led several couples through the green patches of earth marking the U.S. graves in Normandy, where some 2,400 U.S. service members died in the eponymous D-Day invasion on June 6, 1944.

Weeks later, he met Lamm by chance at a gathering on Long Island, N.Y., where they shared their confusion as to why there were not more Jewish stars on display at the deeply sacred memorial site.

“It really struck a chord with me, and I stayed up for hours trying to figure out how many Jewish stars were there and how many should be there,” Lamm recalled. “I worked out that around 2.7 percent of U.S. military casualties from WWll were Jewish, which meant that around 270 Jewish stars should be at Normandy.”

But according to public records, there were only 149. The question of what really happened plagued Lamm so profoundly that he endeavored to take action. He brought in genealogist Steve Lamar in 2016, and the concept of Operation Benjamin fell into place, named after Private First Class Benjamin Barney Garadetsky, 66th Regiment, 2nd Armored Division, who immigrated to the U.S. from the Soviet Union as a small child in 1921.

VETERAN SUICIDE RATES REMAIN ALARMINGLY HIGH DESPITE YEARS OF REFORM

Garadetsky belonged to the fabled 2nd Armored Division, dubbed “Hell on Wheels.” Formed in 1940 at Fort Benning, Ga., by then-Col. George S. Patton, the division’s battlefield prowess spanned two continents and 10 countries over a three-year period.

At age 30, Garadetsky was slain during a Luftwaffe bombing and laid to rest in Normandy, mistakenly underneath the Latin cross, a mistake that would have potentially lingered forever if it were not for the work of Operation Benjamin with the support of the ABMC.

After this first successful marker change, the team has gone on to correct the religious faults that adorn numerous other Jewish soldiers. Two other changes have already taken place in Normandy, and in May, three Jewish American airmen will have their insignia swapped too – two in Belgium and one in France. Family representatives for those fallen are set to also be in attendance.

“When all these men died, they could not ever have imagined there would a Jewish state just a few years later,” Lamm reflected.

The process, which requires approval from the commission, is far from simple. It requires inordinate amounts of documentation concerning the soldier’s heritage and/or authorization for surviving relatives.

Yet for the loved ones and descendants of those who fought and died for the U.S., closure can never come too late.

“For each family, it brings an end to an often very painful or perplexing chapter,” Lamar added. “To know that these individuals were Jewish and proud of their Jewish heritage, but for different reasons were buried under a cross. In many cases, family members didn’t know that they could correct the mistake. Now that they know there is an avenue, there is closure.”",https://www.foxnews.com/world/wwii-jewish-american-pows-burial-star-david

The Oklahoma-born “American Idol” winner shared an adorable photo of her son Isaiah’s school assignment ahead of Valentine’s Day that listed all of his mother’s best attributes.

The 4-year-old jotted down a few remarkably funny answers to the questionnaire, his first quip coming when Isaiah was asked how old he thinks his mom is and he listed Underwood’s age as 70 years old.

CARRIE UNDERWOOD REFLECTS ON PRESSURE TO 'BOUNCE BACK' AFTER SECOND SON

What’s more, when called upon to label what the “Jesus, Take the Wheel” songstress’ job is, Isaiah hilariously wrote, “wash the laundry” and also wrote that his mother was really good at “folding laundry.”

Underwood, whose actual age is 36, shared the sweet tribute to her Instagram account on Thursday, writing in the caption, ""Soooo...apparently I'm 70 and I'm really good at doing the laundry,"" which immediately drew response from Underwood’s pal Miranda Lambert, who simply laughed at the gesture, writing, “Bahahaha.”

Fellow country star Brandi Carlile also got in on the mix, commenting, “OMG! I love kids ❤️😂.”

Underwood has enjoyed an incredibly successful career having nabbed seven Grammy wins out of 14 total nominations, and who could forget about her 14 Academy of Country Music award wins, 12 American Country Awards and nine CMA awards to her jacket.

The “Before He Cheats” performer has also hosted the CMAs for over a decade and just recently announced that she would be stepping down as host in order for her peers to have a go at it.

Last month, Underwood celebrated her second son’s first birthday and shared a series of photos of the adorable toddler mashing his face with cake.

""Happy birthday, Jacob! How are you already 1 year old? You are smiley, crazy, smart, soooo fast and into everything! And, apparently, you love cake!"" she captioned the pictures. ""And, apparently, you love cake!""

The Grammy winner revealed she was pregnant with Jacob in 2018 after suffering multiple miscarriages. In an interview with People magazine at the time, Underwood explained that she kept the news under wraps so that she didn’t give people the perception she was complaining despite all the positive blessings in her life.

110,Granger Smith remarks on his 'failure as a father' in wedding anniversary post discussing late son River,['Tyler Mccarthy'],"Country music singer Granger Smith commemorated his 10th anniversary with his wife, Amber, by sharing a heartfelt note about how they’re coping with the tragic death of their 3-year-old son, River.

In June 2019, a rep for the family confirmed to Fox News that River died in an accidental drowning incident. In a YouTube video posted by the couple later that month, Smith shed some light on what happened to their son. The “Backroad Song” crooner said he was doing gymnastics with his 7-year-old daughter, London, as his sons, River and Lincoln Monarch, 5, were playing with water guns. Minutes later, he found himself performing CPR by the pool.

In a recent post on Instagram to mark his wedding anniversary, the singer shared an image of himself and Amber kissing in an idyllic setting. A video camera is positioned in the foreground, revealing the pose was for a shoot.

GRANGER SMITH'S WIFE LOOKS TOWARD FUTURE AFTER SON'S DEATH: 'I HOPE TO LIVE WITH GRATITUDE'

“It’s not real,"" he captioned the image. “What you see: A couple seemingly in love. Living out the fairytale story draped in the sunset sky with a blue wood planked porch, white antique rocking chair, barefoot, sun kissed hair and summer tanned skin. A couple without a care in the world because LOVE has so consumed them.”

The star went on to explain that he understands his responsibility as a celebrity often means he has to project a “brand” in an effort to maintain his status. However, he warns fans that, “just because its [sic] for sale doesn’t make it 100% REAL.”

He also noted that the couple’s facade is just that, explaining that they’re still coping with the death of River and what he calls his “failure as a father.”

GRANGER SMITH SHARES DETAILS ABOUT THE TRAGIC ACCIDENTAL DEATH OF HIS 3-YEAR-OLD SON

“What I see: 2 people in a storm. Hanging on to God for truth and guidance like a lone fence post in a ravaging wind. I see a girl hurting. Drawing on unimaginable strength just to continue on with necessary motherly duties. Clinging to the Bible like it’s a life raft hurdling [sic] through an unknown sea,” he wrote. “I see a man, savagely battling a relentless demon. Shielded only by Faith and masking the crippling weakness brought on by his deep shame; his failure as a father.”

He continued: “But we’re still in love. Stronger than ever before, but it feels different in its evolution now. It’s not the fairytale, but the vulnerability that fuels the fire. The very essence of what makes us human...bounded by integrity and truth but still fundamentally flawed...that makes our love mature.”

Among those Trump pardoned included financier Michael Milken and former NYPD Commissioner Bernie Kerik, while former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich was among those who had his sentence commuted.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., blasted Trump for the move, claiming he is ignoring inmates convicted of low-level offenses and are not wealthy or well-connected.

According to the White House, the 36-year-old Hall had served nearly 14 years of an 18-year sentence for allowing her apartment to be used to distribute drugs. Munoz has spent 12 years in prison after she was convicted of ""having played a small role in a marijuana smuggling ring,"" while Negron, 48, had served eight years of a 35-year sentence ""for her role as a minority-owner of a healthcare company engaged in a scheme to defraud the Federal Government.""

Johnson said Tuesday that Trump's critics have not looked closely enough at the cases of Hall, Munoz and Negron.

""They should be celebrating that these mothers are being reunited with their families, their stories are very compelling,"" she said. ""And I'm very thankful.""

Johnson was arrested in 1993, convicted of drug conspiracy and money laundering in 1996, and sentenced to life in prison without parole. She has said she did not sell drugs or make deals, though she did admit to acting as an intermediary for those involved, passing along messages.

The video shows the cart knocking the suspect to the ground, allowing officers to catch up and apprehend him. One officer pats the unnamed do-gooder on the shoulder as others help pick up items that fell out of his cart.

The incident happened last month at a Home Depot in Peachtree City, located about 30 miles south of Atlanta. The suspect had taken items from the store and ran into the neighboring Walmart parking lot, FOX5 Atlanta reported.

Police later identified the shoplifting suspect as 41-year-old Marcus Smith, according to the station. He was charged with felony shoplifting and obstruction.

While police were appreciative of the helping hand, they advised potential do-gooders to think of their own safety before stepping in to a police situation.

119,The 9 craziest things seized by Customs and Border Protection,['Morgan Phillips'],"Drugs, fake IDs and counterfeit goods are only the beginning of what Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers seize on a daily basis. Here are nine crazy things people have tried to sneak across international borders:

1. Live pigeons

Customs officials stopped a 23-year-old Australian man after they discovered two eggs in a vitamin container in his luggage. It was under his pant legs that they discovered pigeons wrapped in padded envelopes and secured to each of the man’s legs with a pair of tights. Officials also seized seeds in his money belt and an undeclared eggplant.

The bird smuggler arrived in Australia on a flight from Dubai in February 2009. Charges of wildlife smuggling carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of about $70,430.

2. Egyptian mummy linen

CBP officers in Michigan seized five jars of ancient Egyptian mummy linen coming illegally through the northern border in May 2019.

Inspection of a shipment on a Canadian mail truck in Marysville on May 25 revealed the illegal antiquities believed to be from between 305 to 30 BCE, the agency said. The U.S. government focused on repatriating the artifacts back to Egypt.

3. Live tarantulas

CUBAN MAN WHO RAN COMPLEX MIGRANT-SMUGGLING OPERATION GETS MORE THAN 4 YEARS IN PRISON

Yuck! A German man in 2011 pled guilty to shipping hundreds of live tarantulas into the U.S. through the mail. Sven Koppler, 37, admitted mailing some 247 live tarantulas to federal agents in Los Angeles, who were posing as buyers as part of an investigation dubbed “Operation Spiderman,” according to Reuters.

The investigation began when a routine inspection revealed about 300 live tarantulas in a package he mailed to Los Angeles. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agents placed more orders for spiders from Koppler and were sent a total of five packages containing dozens of live and dead tarantulas. Koppler was arrested when he traveled to Los Angeles months later. He received a total of $300,000 from tarantula sales to spider fanciers in dozens of countries.

4. Man disguised as a car seat

Mexican national Enrique Aguilar Canchola can be seen sewn into a passenger seat of a vehicle in an attempt to illegally enter the U.S.

Canchola was stopped at the San Ysidro border crossing in California in 2001. This was only the beginning of intricate and potentially dangerous compact spaces undocumented immigrants have tried to squeeze into to cross the U.S. border.

5. Black market bologna

In November 2019, CBP officers seized more than 150 pounds of the curious deli meat at port of entry in El Paso, Texas. The CBP said bologna is prohibited to cross the border due to its pork content. Pork products from overseas could introduce foreign animal diseases to the U.S. pork industry. The smuggler tried to tell officers it was turkey ham when questioned about the red rolls lying in the back of his truck.

6. Live songbirds

Sony Dong, 56, was arrested in 2016 for again trying to smuggle endangered “good luck” songbirds into Los Angeles from Vietnam. He was sentenced to a year and a half in prison in 2018 and ordered to pay a $5,500 fine after the judge said the conditions in which the tiny birds were trafficked -- taped to the legs and ankles of smugglers -- were “deplorable,” according to the East Bay Times.

In 2010, Dong had been sentenced to four months in prison after Customs officers found 14 live Asian songbirds, individually wrapped in cloth and strapped to his legs as he tried to pass through LAX after a 15-hour flight from Ho Chi Minh City.

The tiny birds reportedly cost a few dollars each in Southeast Asia but collect between $500 and $1,000 when sold illegally at Chinese markets in Southern California.

7. A whole pig’s head

Hardy the Beagle, who works for CBP as an agriculture detector, discovered this roasted pig’s head and other remnants at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in October 2018. A passenger traveling from Equador was relieved of his leftovers and they were destroyed to avoid introducing foot and mouth disease, classical swine fever and other animal diseases.

8. Dead birds for pet food

Just this week Customs announced that agents in Washington, D.C., seized a package of dead birds from the luggage of a passenger traveling from China. CBP agriculture specialists inspected the passenger’s bag and found the prohibited birds, which the passenger said were food for his cat. Officers seized and incinerated the deceased animals so as to avoid spreading the highly contagious bird flu.

9. Live tropical fish

This may have been the most daring attempt of them all. Customs officials stopped a woman in 2005 when she arrived in Melbourne off a flight from Singapore. There they found 51 live tropical fish in plastic bags tucked into a custom-made apron tied around her waist.

120,‘Assault Weapons’ Ban Shelved by Virginia Senate Committee,['Awr Hawkins'],"The “assault weapons” ban that passed the Democrat-controlled Virginia House of Delegates last week was shelved Monday morning by the Senate’s Judiciary Committee.

WAVY reports the committee voted 10-5 to shift the legislation–HB 961–to the 2021 legislation session.

The shift was supported by Republicans and Sens. John Edwards (D-Roanoke), Creigh Deeds (D-Charlottesville), Scott Surovell (D-Fairfax) and Chap Petersen (D-Fairfax).

Breitbart News reported HB 961 would ban “assault weapons,” magazines holding 12 rounds or more, and suppressors. The legislation was sponsored by Del. Mark Levine (D) and passed by the House of Delegates on Tuesday of last week.

The NRA-ILA reported HB 961, in its original form, contained no grandfather clause for “assault weapons,” but such a clause had to be added in order to garner enough support for passage.

However, Republicans and the handful of Democrats who voted with them on the Senate Judiciary Committee want to wait on the legislation and give time for a study to show whether such a ban carries any benefit in the first place.

121,NASCAR Star Ryan Newman Awake and Talking After Daytona 500 Crash,['Warner Todd Huston'],"NASCAR driver Ryan Newman is “awake and speaking with his family” according to Roush Fenway Racing a day after his terrifying crash during Monday’s leg of the 2020 Daytona 500.

Roush Fenway Racing announced that Newman is still in the hospital but is up and awake. His family also expressed gratitude to fans for their messages and well wishes, WTHR reported.

“Ryan Newman remains under the care of doctors at Halifax Medical Center in Daytona Beach, Florida,” the message said. “He is awake and speaking with family and doctors.”

‘Ryan and his family expressed their appreciation for the concern and heartfelt messages from across the country,” the message continued. “They are grateful for the unwavering support of the NASCAR community and beyond.”

“We will continue to provide information as it becomes available,” the racing concern concluded.

Newman found much support and wishes for a speedy recovery on social media.

No less than President Donald Trump was quick to let Newman’s family know he was praying for the NASCAR star.

122,San Francisco Giants Exclude Aubrey Huff from World Series Reunion Due to Social Media Posts,['Warner Todd Huston'],"The San Francisco Giants confirmed that they will not include former first baseman Aubrey Huff in its upcoming World Series reunion event, because of his social media posts.

Huff hit .294 with a home run during the 2010 World Series. He was also still with the team during their 2012 championship run.

Still, the team has announced that Huff will not be included in the team’s reunion event planned for later this summer, according to Fox News.

“Earlier this month, we reached out to Aubrey Huff to let him know that he will not be included in the upcoming 2010 World Series Championship reunion. Aubrey has made multiple comments on social media that are unacceptable and run counter to the values of our organization,” the Giants said in a statement. “While we appreciate the many contributions that Aubrey made to the 2010 championship season, we stand by our decision.”

Huff slammed the team for playing politics and blamed his exclusion on his support of President Trump.

“When I asked why I wasn’t invited [Baer] told [me] that the board didn’t approve of my Twitter posts, and my political support of Donald Trump. My locker room humor on Twitter is meant to be satirical, and sarcastic. And it was that type of humor that loosened up the clubhouse in 2010 for our charge at a World Series title. They loved it then, and it hasn’t changed. That’s not the issue. It’s politics,” Huff replied on Twitter.

“I find this whole thing very hypocritical coming from a man who has had his share of real controversy for pushing his wife for which he had to take a break from the Giants and issue a formal apology. All I did was tweet.”

Huff noted that he was proud of his pro baseball career and is disappointed by the team’s actions.

Huff came under fire last month for a tweet saying that “we” should “kidnap” Iranian women, “about 10 each. We can bring them back here as they fan us and feed us grapes, amongst other things.”

He later deleted the tweet and claimed it was a joke.

Huff also took criticism for a tweet featuring a photo of his children at a gun range with a caption saying he was “Getting my boys trained up on how to use a gun in the unlikely event @BernieSanders beats @realDonaldTrump in 2020.”

123,"NFL Stars Jerry Rice, Jim Brown Praise Trump for Pardoning Eddie DeBartolo Jr.",['Charlie Spiering'],"President Donald Trump pardoned former San Francisco 49ers wonder, Eddie Debartolo Jr., on Tuesday, the White House announced.

Former NFL players Jerry Rice, Jim Brown, Ronnie Lott and Charles Haley met with Trump regarding the pardon for DeBartolo, that was announced at the White House with Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley.

Speaking to reporters outside of the White House, former football star Jim Brown thanked Trump for the pardon calling DeBartolo a “great man.”

Hall of Fame receiver Jerry Rice also recognized DeBartolo for building a successful team.

“It was all about family. That’s really what they stood for. And that’s the reason why I think we won so many championships,” Rice said.

Rice also thanked Trump for the pardon.

“I take my hat off to Donald Trump for what he did,” he said.

DeBartolo was indicted in 1998 after Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards demanded that he pay him $400,000 for a Louisiana riverboat gambling license. He plead guilty for the offense of failing to report extortion and avoided prison.

He was punished by the NFL who suspended him for a the 1999 season and fined him $1 million.

DeBartolo never returned to the team despite presiding over their five Super Bowls victories in just 14 years.

124,WATCH: Braves’ Nick Markakis Says Every Single Astro ‘Needs a Beating’ over Sign-Stealing Scandal,['Dylan Gwinn'],"Several MLB players have spoken out and voiced their anger at the Houston Astros over the sign-stealing scheme the team used during their World Series run in 2017. However, not many have voiced their anger as bluntly as Nick Markakis.

Markakis, an outfielder for the Braves, told reporters that every Astro “needs a beating” for cheating the game.

“It’s anger,” Markakis said. “I feel like every single guy over there needs a beating. It’s wrong. They’re messing with people’s careers.”

According to ESPN:

Markakis did not elaborate on what would constitute a ‘beating.’ At least two pitchers have indicated that they would at least consider throwing at Astros batters, and William Hill sportsbook set an over/under of 83.5 for Houston hit-by-pitches in 2020, a number that would rank as one of the 10 highest in the previous five seasons.

Markakis also took a shot at MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred, for not punishing Astros players for cheating.

“The way he handled the situation, he should be embarrassed of himself,” Markakis said.

Though, Markakis seems most distressed by the damage that the Astros cheating scandal has done to baseball.

“There’s right ways to do it and wrong ways to do it,” Markakis explained. “I 100% disagree with way they did it. There’s a lot of people that were hurt by it, and it was wrong.”

The Astros employed a camera in center-field to help steal signs. When the batter was at the plate, a trash can would be banged to let the hitter know that an off-speed pitch would be on the way.

Newman had surged into the lead on the final lap when Blaney’s bumper caught the back of his Ford and sent Newman hard right into the wall. His car flipped, rolled, was hit on the driver’s side by another car, and finally skidded across the finish line engulfed in flames. It took several minutes for his car to be rolled back onto its wheels. The 2008 Daytona 500 winner was placed in a waiting ambulance and taken directly to a hospital, and the damage to his Mustang was extensive.

127,"Tebow Had ‘Some Discussion’ with the XFL, Chose Baseball Instead",['Dylan Gwinn'],"Whether Tim Tebow ever plays in the major leagues remains to be seen, but the former Heisman winner does indeed appear to be officially done with football.

Speaking with reporters at a press conference on Sunday, Tebow said he had spoken with the XFL, but ultimately decided baseball was for him.

“We had a couple conversations,” Tebow explained. “But it was pretty clear that this was — I love what they’re doing. I think it has a chance to have success. And I think that’s great. And so I think there needs to be a place for a lot of players that are really good and should and could be playing in the NFL and are better than a lot of NFL players. And there’s a chance they’re going to be seen. So I think it’s awesome and I think it’s good for a lot of guys that are going to get a spot on an NFL roster because they’re going show a team that they’re worth it. But for me this is what I wanted to do and pursuit it and be all in and just, yeah.”

Tebow’s position is understandable. The NFL had every opportunity in the world to find a spot for Tebow, and didn’t. At his age, 32, the former Gator only has time to try and make one dream come true. Not to mention the fact that he hasn’t appeared in a regular-season football game since 2012.

The real loss here, is the XFL’s. Tebow would draw a huge number of viewers and attendees any time he took the field, plus a huge amount of media attention that the young league could desperately use.

Still, Tebow is nothing if not committed once he sets his sights on something, And despite the doubt that most analysts and a majority of fans have about his chances of ever being a major league baseball player, Tebow is still betting on himself.

128,Transgender Runners Take 1st and 2nd Place at Connecticut High School Championships,['Warner Todd Huston'],"Transgender sprinters have once again taken top spots in high school indoor track championships, reports say.

Bloomfield High School’s Terry Miller and Cromwell High School runner Andraya Yearwood, biological males who claim to be transgender girls, have once again come away with the top awards for high school sprinters in the Nutmeg State, the Washington Times reported.

Miller and Yearwood took first and second place in the 55-meter dash at the state open indoor track championships. Miller also set a girl’s state indoor record of 6.95 seconds in the event. Taking second, Yearwood ran at 7.01 seconds. The numbers are significant considering that the third-place winner — who is a biological female — only finished at 7.23 seconds.

This is the second year in a row where Miller and Yearwood took the top spots away from biologically female contestants in the state championships. Yearwood won the 100-meter state championships last year, and Miller tool the 300.

Critics point out that the two keep winning because they are biological males with more physical power. But the state’s Interscholastic Athletic Conference claims it allows them to compete as females because they are required to follow a state anti-discrimination law.

“I have learned a lot about myself and about other people through this transition. I always try to focus most on all of the positive encouragement that I have received from family, friends and supporters,” Yearwood recently told the AP. “I use the negativity to fuel myself to run faster.”

Still, Yearwood admitted that even though he is transitioning to a female, he is stronger than his natural-born female opponents.

“One high jumper could be taller and have longer legs than another, but the other could have perfect form, and then do better,” Yearwood said. “One sprinter could have parents who spend so much money on personal training for their child, which, in turn, would cause that child to run faster.”

Yearwood and Miller have faced stiff opposition to their participation in the state’s female sports.

High school runner Selina Soule has been a strong voice of opposition.

“We all know the outcome of the race before it even starts; it’s demoralizing,” she has said. “I fully support and am happy for these athletes for being true to themselves. They should have the right to express themselves in school, but athletics have always had extra rules to keep the competition fair.”

Families of these biological girls who oppose the state’s policy are not sitting idly by. The families of three of these runners filed a federal lawsuit this month seeking to block transgender girls from competing against biological girls.

The girls, Selina Soule, of Glastonbury High School, Alanna Smith, of Danbury High School, and Chelsea Mitchell, of Canton High School, all filed suit this month. Arguing that allowing athletes with male anatomy to compete against biological girls deprives girls of track titles and scholarship opportunities.

129,Pastor Paula White-Cain: Prayer Can Help America Come Back Together,['Joel B. Pollak'],"Pastor Paula White-Cain told Breitbart News Sunday that prayer can help Americans come together in a politically divided time.

White-Cain, who is a spiritual advisor to President Donald Trump, and the author of Something Greater: Finding Triumph over Trials, appeared on the program as part of a new segment highlighting spiritual lessons and insights to take into the week ahead.

She was asked about the erosion of social conventions and political rituals designed to keep Americans united even in the face of deep divisions.

The context was a discussion of the bizarre gesture by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) earlier this month to rip up President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address as he was acknowledging cheers in the House of Representatives.

Pelosi continues to defend her actions, which gained media attention but also criticism.

Breitbart News asked Pastor White-Cain what Americans should do when a leader literally tears a national symbol apart on live television.

In a boxing match — like the upcoming heavyweight bout between Deontay Wilder and Tyson Fury — there are rituals through which the fighters express sportsmanship.

But Pelosi’s gesture suggested that those rituals were being destroyed in politics.

White-Cain, noting that even some Democrats were disheartened by what Pelosi had done, said that prayer was a ritual that Americans could use to step back from the political situation and recognize our commonality.

“You have to start to start with prayer. I don’t think intellect and human wisdom can solve this,” she said.

She cited the story of Nehemiah in the Old Testament, who was struggling to rebuild the walls of the Temple in Jerusalem against vehement opposition, and turned to prayer to unify and strengthen the nation.

White-Cain added that when leaders said that they prayed for one another, they should mean it.

She concluded by citing the parting words of Jesus to the Church in the New Testament (John 17:21): “Let them be one, even as We are One.”

She also cited Psalm 133 — “How good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together” — which is important to both the Jewish and Christian faiths.

NASCAR teen sensation Hailee Deegan was also thrilled to meet the president. Deegan, 18, who made her NASCAR debut this year, tweeted ahead of the weekend that she hoped to get the president to autograph her helmet.

131,XFL Sees Big Attendance Jump in Week 2,['Dylan Gwinn'],"The XFL posted solid attendance numbers in their first week of action, and built on that strong showing in their second week.

According to Ben Fischer of Sports Business Daily, the XFL welcomed 76,285 fans to their games this weekend, a 9.5 percent increase from Week 1. Though, the cause for that increase can be attributed to one fan base.

The more than 29,000 fans who showed up to watch the Seattle Dragons home opener, fueled the league’s attendance rise. The rest of the teams fared not so well,

According to Pro Football Talk:

The two teams that hosted games in Week One and Week Two saw lower crowds, with 15,031 showing up for the D.C. Defenders 27-0 win over the New York Guardians, 12.4 percent down from Week One. Also, the Houston Roughnecks had 17,103 witness their 28-24 win over St. Louis, a four-percent dip. The L.A. Wildcats had 14,979 witness a 25-18 loss to Dallas at Dignity Health Sports Park, the site of L.A. Chargers home games from 2017 through 2019. It was the smallest crowd of the eight games played to date by the resurrected XFL.

The television ratings for the new league will be released on Tuesday. Though, the numbers could be lower than last week given that the early Saturday game between the Defenders and the Guardians was a blowout, and Sunday’s games were up against the Daytona 500. A general lack of offense and good quarterback play is another troubling sign for the league.

However, given the fact that the league had no preseason and the fact that there aren’t 32 good quarterbacks in the NFL, so there’s definitely not going to be an additional eight good ones in the XFL, some early season offensive struggles are to be expected.

Hopefully, the league lasts long enough for the offenses to start to click.

132,Donald Trump Jr. Helps Teen NASCAR Star Hailee Deegan Get Her Helmet Signed by the President,['Warner Todd Huston'],"When 18-year-old NASCAR star Hailie Deegan heard that President Donald Trump was going to attend the Daytona 500, she went on a quest to get Trump to sign her helmet. It was a quest that only the president’s son could facilitate.

Ahead of the big race, Deegan jumped to Twitter to let fans know that she was in the hunt for the president’s autograph.

Today’s goal. Get my helmet signed by Trump https://t.co/5v9y2vrjPg — Hailie Deegan (@HailieDeegan) February 16, 2020

Amusingly, Don Trump, Jr., saw the tweet and made one of his own:

DM me… I may know someone. https://t.co/bJoxmZFP73 — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) February 16, 2020

Sure enough, on Sunday, Don Trump, Jr., proved he is a man of his word and posted a photo of Deegan happily displaying her signed helmet.

“Promises Made… Promises Kept! Great to meet you [Hailie Deegan],” Trump, Jr., posted.

The teenaged racing star also posted a photo of her own:

Deegan was not scheduled to race on Sunday, but she has become a rising star in the racing circuit, having made her debut this month, finishing second to Michael Self in the Feb. 8 ARCA Series season opener.

“I think there’s that aspect of being a girl that does help,” Deegan told the Associated Press. “But, once you get in the car, it don’t matter. No one knows. Most of the time, I have the most aggressive-looking, guy-looking car on the track.”

President Trump became only the second president ever to attend the Daytona 500. Not only did he issue the “start your engines” call, but he took the famed presidential limo “The Beast” for a victory lap around the track.

133,"Media, Pundits Triggered by Trump’s ‘Taxpayer Funded’ Daytona Lap in ‘The Beast’",['Dylan Gwinn'],"The collapse of the Russian and Ukrainian impeachment hoaxes has left a huge void to fill in the left’s ceaseless war on the will of the American voter.

Though, on Sunday, liberal pundits and journalists averted their longing gaze from Eastern Europe and focused on something far closer to home, to satisfy their need for evidence of Trumpian evil: The president’s car.

The presidential limousine, known to many as “The Beast,” led the field of drivers on a pace lap at the Daytona 500. The scene was unlike any other we’ve scene in previous Daytona races, as the president rode in his official vehicle and led the more than 40 drivers around the track.

However, several members of the mainstream media were less than enthralled with the intermingling of presidential power with the Great American Race.

NBC White House Correspondent Kelly O’Donnell noted that the trip to Daytona was an “official White House event.” Meaning, that the president’s appearance and trip around the track in “The Beast,” was paid for by the “taxpayers.”

However, most of the taxpayers who responded to O’Donnell’s tweet, seemed to have no problem with the presidential trip around the track.

The Daytona 500 is of course, the Great American Race, not a “political event.” However, the president will soon depart for a swing through the Western states of Arizona, Nevada, and Colorado. Those will be political events, Air Force 1 and “The Beast” will also make the trip.

134,NYT’s Reporter Blasts Trump for Using ‘The Beast’ at Daytona for Apparent ‘Political Event’,['Dylan Gwinn'],"There were no shortage of reactions on social media Sunday as President Trump led the field on a pace lap in the presidential limo, aka “The Beast.”

However, one reaction from a media member read more like a legal charge against the president, than a mere observation.

Maggie Haberman, a reporter for the New York Times, captioned a tweet showing the president’s limo on the track and cited Trump for using the “apparatus of government” for a “what appears to be a political event.”

Of course, the Daytona 500 is the Great American Race, and not a “political event.” The president’s limo, “The Beast,” is also Trump’s designated vehicle to use while serving as president. Not sure exactly what vehicle Haberman thinks the president should have used, not sure anyone cares what she thinks either.

135,President Trump Takes the Lead for a Lap at Daytona 500 In ‘The Beast’,['Warner Todd Huston'],"President Donald Trump became only the second U.S. president to attend the Daytona 500 on Sunday, but he did so in style by taking “The Beast” presidential limo for a lap around the track head of this year’s race.

With first lady Melania Trump sitting beside him, the president rode the 18-foot-long limo around the track as the race crews prepared to for one of the nation’s top auto races.

“The Beast” limo is quite a machine. Weighing in at 22,000 pounds of armor and bullet proof glass, the 2-year-old limo is built on a Cadillac CT6 stretch sedan that seats seven.

The car is built to deter any attacker. The $1.5 million armored car can spew a smokescreen and an oil slick in its wake to thwart chasing cars, not to mention firing tear gas to disperse attackers. It also has super wide, run-flat tires to rumble over and beyond road obstructions. In addition, the door handles are rigged to give an electric shock to unwanted intruders and he car is even equipped to send the nuclear launch codes if need be.

There is also a refrigerated compartment carrying a supply of the president’s blood type and other medical and first aid necessities if the worst happens.

“The Beast” was built by GM as part of a 12-car contract worth $15.8 million.

This year, President Trump also issued the “start your engines” call and wished the drivers a safe and successful race:

Race fans cheered and shouted four more years as the president and first lady arrived at 2:50 p.m.

The president thanked the “tens of thousands of patriots“ gathered at the Daytona International Speedway in a short speech before the race.

“NASCAR fans never forget that no matter who wins the race, what matters most is God, family, country,” he said.

The president welcomed Gold Star families as guests to the race, thanking their fallen loved ones for their service.

“Rubber will burn, fans will scream and the great American race will begin,” Trump said.

The president delivered the famous lines at the beginning of the race, shouting “Gentlemen start your engines!” to begin the race.

The president also participated in an interview with FOX Sports before the race and said that he had attended NASCAR four times prior to his visit.

“I think it’s really the bravery of these people … it takes great courage, it’s the speed, it’s really the technology, looking at what’s happened in the last ten years with the cars. I love to see it, I love to watch it,” he said when he was asked why he was a fan of the race.

When asked if he would drive his own car on the track, Trump replied, “I think I’m going to right now, if I can, I’m going to hop in one of these cars and I’m going to get into this race if possible.”

“Trump’s reelection campaign will run a TV ad during the Fox broadcast of the race and fly an aerial banner near the speedway. About 100,000 people are expected to attend this year’s race and millions more will watch on television. About 9 million people took in last year’s race on television.

138,Astros Fans Furious at Buffalo Wild Wings over ‘Cheating’ Tweet,['Warner Todd Huston'],"Houston Astros fans were not very happy when Buffalo Wild Wings posted a snarky tweet about the Astros sign-stealing scandal.

The pro baseball team has been at the center of accusations of breaking Major League Baseball rules by using electronic devices to spy on opposing teams in order to steal their coaching signs and using that information to prepare their own players to face their opponents.

Some have even accused the Astros of having players wear “buzzing devices” so that coaches in the dugout could alert batters to the pitches they might face. This claim, though, was investigated by the league and discounted.

In any case, Astros fans responded in anger to the restaurant’s obvious ribbing.

139,Former Jaguars Jumbotron Operator Arrested on Child Porn Charges,['Warner Todd Huston'],"A former operator of the Jacksonville Jaguars’ Jumbotron has been arrested on child pornography charges.

Samuel Arthur Thompson, a convicted sex offender, was indicted on new charges on Wednesday including receiving and possessing images of child abuse, the New York Post reported.

Federal authorities accused Thompson of using his access to the Jaguars’ computer system to send and receive the illegal images.

Thompson worked for the team between April of 2017 and February of 2018, after which the team refused to renew his contract. But according to an investigation, Thompson continued to remotely exploit his access to the team’s computers and used a rogue server in the computer room for the illegal purpose.

Authorities served a search warrant on Thompson’s devices and reportedly found sexually explicit images. Officials report finding evidence that Thompson was connecting to the server inside the team’s computer network.

Thompson also had a firearm, which he is legally prevented from owning due to a conviction from 1998 on a case of sexually abusing a child in Alabama.

In addition, the ex-employee was cited for traveling to the Bahamas and the Philippines without disclosing the reasons for his trips, another violation of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act.

The Jaguars released a short statement on the arrest reading: “We are aware of the charges involving a former contractor, and we have cooperated with the investigation as requested. We cannot otherwise comment on this legal matter.”

If convicted on these latest charges, Thompson could face up to 100 years in prison.

140,Megan Youngren to Become First Transgender Runner to Compete at U.S. Olympic Marathon Trials,['Warner Todd Huston'],"The U.S. Olympic marathon trials have accepted the first transgender runner in the history of the event.

Megan Youngren, 29, a biological male who identifies as a transgender female will compete in the trials as a female, according to the Daily Mail.

Youngren, who reportedly came out as transgender in 2012, is set to compete against 63 biological women for a spot on the 2020 U.S. Olympics team for this year’s Summer Games.

“I’m open to talking about it to people because that’s the only way you make progress on stuff like this,” Youngren recently said. The runner finalized paperwork for the transition to female in 2019.

In 2019, Youngren completed the Los Angeles Marathon in 3:06:42 and felt that completing the race in under three hours time is possible. So, Youngren jumped into a strict training regimen. Success brought greater ambition and, eventually, Olympic dreams.

Last December, Youngren finished 40th at the California International Marathon, completing the course in 2:43:52, giving the runner an opening to join the Olympic trials.

“I thought that if I worked incredibly hard and took some huge risks that I could run a 2:45,” Youngren said. “People will try to put it down by saying, ‘That’s too easy because you’re trans.’ But what about the 500 other women who will qualify? There’s probably someone with the exact same story. I trained hard. I got lucky. I dodged injuries. I raced a lot, and it worked out for me. That’s the story for a lot of other people, too.

“I have done everything by the book, and I can show that,” Youngren added.

Youngren is not the only trans person with the Olympics.

Chris Mosier already became the first transgender athlete to join Team USA after qualifying for the sprint duathlon men’s team for the 2016 World Championship. Mosier was born a woman but now identifies as male. Mosier also already qualified to compete in the Olympic trials for the men’s 50km race walk.

USATF has defended its inclusion of the trans athletes and said it follows the International Olympic Committee’s rules for transgender athletes. Currently, a transgender female athlete must have testosterone below ten nanomoles per liter for at least 12 months before competition and must remain below that threshold during the period of competition. The IOC, though, recently considered changing its rules for transgender athletes, but the organization’s negotiations broke down.

141,Pete Buttigieg Warns Black Law Students at UNLV: White Supremacy Could ‘Totally Destroy the American Project’,['Joel B. Pollak'],"LAS VEGAS, Nevada — Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg warned the Black Law Students Association (BLSA) at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) Tuesday afternoon that we might see “white supremacy totally destroy the American project.”

Buttigieg was speaking as part of a four-day swing though the Silver State during early voting in the Nevada caucuses, which officially take place Feb. 22.

The event was hosted by BLSA but open to others at the William S. Boyd School of Law. Buttigieg, who is currently leading the national race for delegates to the Democratic National Convention, answered questions from Prof. Frank Cooper, Director of UNLV’s Program on Race, Gender & Policing. The topics covered a wide range of issues, and included criminal justice reform and drug legalization.

At one point, Buttigieg pledged to end the policy of “family separation” at the U.S. border — though that policy had already been ended by President Donald Trump via executive order nearly two years ago.

Outside, two pro-life students, Angelique and Anali, held a protest against Buttigieg on behalf of UNLV Rebels for life.

They identified themselves as feminists who oppose abortion, and told Breitbart News that there were no Democratic Party candidates they could support because all back late-term abortion.

Frank, a first-year law student who attended the Buttigieg event, and who is also African American, told Breitbart News that he was impressed by Buttigieg, though he had not yet made up his mind whom he would vote for in the caucuses Saturday.

“He’s very sincere. He addressed ‘problem issues’ and didn’t run from them,” Frank said. “It’s very easy to tailor your message to certain audiences. But I really believe he’s interested in learning what he doesn’t know.”

Prof. Cooper was similarly positive about Buttigieg’s appearance, saying that while he had not made up his own mind yet, the young presidential contender had moved up his list of potential choices.

142,Bernie Sanders Blasts Bloomberg and His 'Racist Policies' at Rally,['Hannah Bleau'],"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) took direct aim at his rising rival Michael Bloomberg (D) during a massive rally at the Tacoma Dome on Monday, blasting his record as New York City mayor and warning him that he is “not gonna buy this election.”

Sanders, along with guests Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), actor Tim Robbins, and the indie rock band Portugal. The Man, drew a crowd of over 17,000 in Tacoma, Washington, on Monday evening. The presidential hopeful took a moment out of his traditional stump-style speech to send a direct message to his billionaire rival Bloomberg, who is dramatically surging in the polls.

“Today we say to Mayor Bloomberg: we are a democracy, not an oligarchy, you’re not gonna buy this election,” Sanders told the crowd, taking a shot at the former mayor’s record, including what Sanders described as his “racist policies like stop and frisk.”

“We say to Mr. Bloomberg, you are certainly not going to win when you have a record in New York City that included racist policies like stop and frisk which caused communities of color to live in fear and humiliation in New York City,” the presidential hopeful said.

“You’re not going to win an election when you opposed raising the minimum wage,” Sanders said, adding that those who “have billions of dollars” should “not be opposed to raising the minimum wage above $7.25.”

He also criticized Bloomberg for purportedly calling for cuts to programs such as Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare.

“The American people, working for families all over this country, want an economy and a government that works for all of us — not just a handful of billionaires,” he warned.

“Mr. Bloomberg, like anybody else, has a right to run for president. He does not have a right to buy the presidency,” Sanders tweeted Monday evening:

Sanders remarks come amid bubbling tensions between the respective campaigns. On Monday, Bloomberg’s campaign manager Kevin Sheekey accused the socialist senator of deploying “the very same attacks and tactics against Mike” as President Trump.

“It’s a shameful turn of events to see Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump deploy the very same attacks and tactics against Mike, but the reason is clear,” Sheekey said.

“At this point, the primary is Bernie’s to lose, and ours to win. Bernie knows this,” Sheekey continued. “Trump knows this. That’s why they are united in the campaign against Mike.”

The mounting criticisms preceded Tuesday’s National Public Radio/Marist/PBS NewsHour poll, which shows Sanders ahead by double digits with 31 percent support and Bloomberg jumping to second place with 19 percent support. The poll officially makes it possible for Bloomberg to participate in Wednesday’s NBC/MSNBC/Nevada Independent Democrat debate in Las Vegas.

Bloomberg’s campaign confirmed that he will, in fact, participate, giving Sanders a chance to question his rival face to face.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/18/bernie-sanders-blasts-michael-bloomberg-and-his-racist-policies-at-massive-rally/
143,Warren: Everyone Here Illegally Must Be Able to Secure U.S. Citizenship,['John Binder'],"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) says “everyone who is here” illegally must have a path to obtaining American citizenship — a policy that would eventually give voting rights to the 11 to 22 million illegal aliens in the United States.

During a town hall at the Domestic Workers Forum in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Tuesday, Warren reiterated her plan to make sure all illegal aliens are able to obtain American citizenship and thus, eventually, voting rights.

The plan, Warren vowed, would also increase the flow of legal immigration to the U.S. beyond its current admission of about 1.2 million foreign nationals a year, who are delivered to big business as an endless stream of foreign labor.

Warren said:

Immigration does not make our country weaker, immigration makes our country stronger. We need to change our immigration laws. I want to see expanded immigration. I want to see a path to citizenship, not only for DREAMers, but for everyone who is here to stay. Mixed-status families, we should not have. We should keep our families together. I think that’s powerfully important. [Emphasis added]

Despite her rivalry with fellow 2020 Democrat presidential primary candidate billionaire Michael Bloomberg, the two share an immigration agenda that is centered on driving up the U.S. population to win business, Wall Street investors, corporate developers, and elected Democrats more foreign workers, more consumers, more residents in need of housing, and more left-leaning voters.

Despite Rivalry, Michael Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren Share Donor Class Immigration Agenda https://t.co/tPj5VBHUVO — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) December 2, 2019

Warren’s donor class immigration plan, as Breitbart News has reported, is supported by tech billionaires, the open borders lobby, the outsourcing industry, the Chamber of Commerce, as well as the nation’s giant multinational corporations that have sought for decades to drive down U.S. wages by importing cheaper foreign workers to compete against America’s working and middle class.

Already, at current legal immigration levels, the U.S. is set to increase its population to 404 million residents by 2060 — the largest population in American history. This indicates that by 2060, about one-in-six U.S. residents will have been born in a foreign country.

In 1970, one-in-twenty U.S. residents were foreign-born. At current legal immigration levels, nearly 580,000 foreign-born residents will be added to the population every year, while just 1.3 million native-born residents are set to be added every year. A moratorium on immigration would stabilize the nation’s population at about 250 million residents.

144,Donald Trump Commutes Democrat Gov. Rod Blagojevich’s Jail Sentence,['Charlie Spiering'],"President Donald Trump commuted the jail sentence for former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich (D) on Tuesday, Trump confirmed to reporters.

“I watched his wife on television; I don’t know him very well,” Trump said, acknowledging that the former governor appeared on his show Celebrity Apprentice. “Seemed like a very nice person, don’t know him. … I did commute his sentence.”

Blagojevich was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he tried to sell the U.S. Senate seat vacated by former Sen. Barack Obama after he was elected president in 2008. To date, Blagojevich has served over seven years of his prison sentence.

Trump said that Blagojevich was prosecuted by “the same people, Comey, Fitzpatrick, the same group” that prosecuted him, and acknowledged that even though the governor was a Democrat, he deserved release from prison.

“Very far from his children, they’re growing older. They’re going to high school now. They rarely get to see their father outside of an orange uniform,” Trump said. “I saw that, and I did commute his sentence.”

The president has frequently discussed the idea of a pardon for Blagojevich, as he views the 14-year penalty as too harsh just for “being stupid” by discussing something that “many other politicians say.”

The Illinois state legislature impeached Blagojevich and removed him from office in 2009, which led him to appear on Celebrity Apprentice.

Trump ultimately fired Blagojevich after four weeks on the show.

Illinois Republicans have strongly objected to the idea of a pardon.

Trump sent the case to White House lawyers to review despite appearing ready to grant the pardon in 2018.

“We’re looking at it. I feel very badly. I think it was very harshly sentenced, but we’re looking at it very strongly. People feel very strongly about that,” Trump said in August.

He also criticized FBI officials for the unfair prosecution of Blagojevich.

“A lot of people thought it was unfair, like a lot of other things — and it was the same gang, the Comey gang and all these sleazebags that did it,” Trump said in 2018.

In January, Blagojevich wrote an op-ed in Newsmax criticizing Democrats for trying to impeach Trump.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/18/donald-trump-commutes-democrat-gov-rod-blagojevichs-jail-sentence/
145,Buttigieg Falsely Claims Late-Term Abortions Due to ‘Devastating’ Problem,['Dr. Susan Berry'],"CLAIM: A Democrat who promotes abortion on demand at any time during pregnancy, Pete Buttigieg claimed most abortions that occur very late in pregnancy are due to some “devastating news” the mother has just heard and then she faces a decision about whether to terminate her baby’s life.

VERDICT: FALSE

During the 2016 presidential race, failed Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton brought the same false claim forward once again and it has been repeated continually by the abortion industry and their allies in politics and the media.

The problem with the claim is that abortionists themselves have been saying it is false for decades.

""The majority of these procedures [late-term abortions] are performed… on healthy women and healthy fetuses."" – Ron Fitzsimmons, Director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers https://t.co/S8IiG32gr9 — Lila Rose (@LilaGraceRose) February 6, 2019

According to a 1997 report in the Los Angeles Times, Ron Fitzsimmons, former executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, admitted partial birth abortions were not that rare.

“The abortion rights folks know it, the anti-abortion folks know it and so, probably, does everyone else,” Fitzsimmons said, adding that he “lied through [his] teeth” during a Nightline interview when he said partial-birth abortions were rarely performed and only due to fetal anomalies and serious health risks to the mother.

Murdered abortionist George Tiller told National Abortion Federation attendees in 1995:

We have some experience with late terminations; about 10,000 patients between 24 and 36 weeks and something like 800 fetal anomalies between 26 and 36 weeks in the past 5 years.

“That equates to a mere eight percent of Tiller’s late-term patients who aborted because their babies were diagnosed prenatally with a health condition,” pro-life organization Live Action observed.

A study released in 2013 by the pro-abortion rights Guttmacher Institute also found that women who were seeking both first-trimester and late-term abortions provided the same reasons for delaying the procedure, including “not knowing about the pregnancy,” “trouble deciding about the abortion,” and “disagreeing about the abortion with the man involved.”

The study concluded that “most women seeking later terminations are not doing so for reasons of fetal anomaly or life endangerment.”

A 2018 report for the Congressional Research Service noted that Dr. Diana Greene Foster, professor at the University of California, San Francisco, said abortions for fetal anomaly “make up a small minority of later abortion” and that, due to inadequate data, those for endangerment to the life of the mother are even more difficult to describe.

Only a year ago, former Planned Parenthood President Dr. Leana Wen was seen repeating the same falsehood:

90% of abortions occur before 21 weeks. As a doctor & public health expert, I can tell you that those that occur later often result from a diagnosis of severe fetal abnormalities, or serious risks to the woman's health. — Leana Wen, M.D. (@DrLeanaWen) February 6, 2019

Wen repeatedly made the claim that the procedure is performed in the third trimester of pregnancy due to “severe fetal abnormalities” or “serious risks to the woman’s health.”

In late 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported nearly 13,000 fully developed babies who would be able to survive outside the womb are aborted annually.

Buttigieg reiterated the false claim during a recent appearance on ABC’s The View, when co-host Meghan McCain asked the Democrat presidential candidate about his view of partial-birth abortion.

“My point is it shouldn’t be up to a government official to draw the line,” Buttigieg said. “It should be up to the woman.”

McCain then asked, “So if a woman wanted to invoke infanticide after a baby was born, you’d be comfortable with that?”

Buttigieg replied, “Does anybody seriously think that’s what these cases are about?”

He continued:

Think about the situation. If this is a late-term situation, then by definition, it’s one where a woman was expecting to carry the pregnancy to term. Then she gets the most, perhaps, devastating news of her life. We’re talking about families that may have picked out a name, maybe assembling a crib, and they learn something, excruciating, and are faced with this terrible choice. And I don’t know what to tell them, morally, about what they should do. I just know that I trust, and her decision, medically or morally, isn’t going to be any better because the government is commanding her to do it.

After hearing Buttigieg’s response, McCain responded, “Quite frankly, that answer was just as radical as I thought it was, sorry.”",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/18/fact-check-pete-buttigieg-falsely-claims-very-late-term-abortions-occur-due-to-devastating-problem/
146,"Trump, Flynn to Gather Evidence for Crossfire Hurricane",['Aaron Klein'],"Unbeknownst to both Trump and Flynn, that FBI investigator memorialized that briefing, which included exchanges with Flynn and Trump, in an official document that was added to the Crossfire Hurricane case file probing the Trump campaign over unsubstantiated and ultimately discredited charges of Russian collusion.

The FBI file documenting the August 2016 briefing describes two questions asked by candidate Trump as well as comments from Trump and Flynn and exchanges with the briefer from the FBI who was not identified to either Trump or Flynn during the briefing as working on the Crossfire Hurricane team probing Flynn and other members of the Trump campaign.

James A. Baker, the former FBI general counsel, conceded that the briefer “was there on the off chance that somebody said something that might be useful.”

This means the FBI’s controversial Crossfire Hurricane probe team investigating members of the Trump campaign not only directly interfaced with Trump and Flynn without telling them but also recorded their comments in the official case file. Flynn at the time was already a target of the FBI probe.

Moreover, the FBI investigator who conducted the briefing says that he used the occasion as an opportunity to study Flynn’s behavior and mannerisms just in case the FBI needed to eventually conduct a subject interview of Flynn. Indeed, the same investigator himself was the FBI agent who conducted an in-person FBI interview with Flynn on January 24, 2017 in connection with the FBI’s investigation of Flynn.

All those details and more were contained deep inside the Justice Department’s previously released 476-page Inspector General report on the FBI’s Russia collusion investigation.

The details may take on renewed significant amid the reported decision by Attorney General William P. Barr to assigned an outside prosecutor to scrutinize the case against Flynn.

The briefing in question was a standard FBI unclassified “counterintelligence awareness” briefing routinely given to the transition teams for presidential candidates during an election cycle. The briefings were provided to both the Trump and Clinton campaigns. The briefing for Trump and his selected advisors, including Flynn, took place on August 17, 2016.

The FBI investigator told the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) that disgraced FBI agent Peter Strzok was mostly responsible for helping him prepare the briefing with Trump and Flynn.

The investigator said he prepared himself for facing Trump and Flynn in a series of mock briefings attended by both Strzok and FBI attorney Lisa Page, the infamous texting duo who were previously reportedly romantically involved.

The IG report says that Andrew McCabe, who served under Comey as the FBI’s deputy director, “acknowledged that it was possible he was part of a conversation about whether SSA 1 should handle the briefing because of his involvement with Crossfire Hurricane, but said he could not recall any such conversation.”

SSA 1 refers to the unnamed senior member of the Crossfire Hurricane team who conducted the sneaky briefing.

While McCabe claims he couldn’t recall participating in any discussions about using Crossfire Hurricane member SSA 1 to brief the unsuspecting Trump and Flynn, Baker, the former FBI general counsel, sung a different tune.

Baker recalled that discussions about using SSA 1 as the FBI briefer did occur at higher levels within the FBI and those discussions included himself, McCabe, Strzok and possibly Lisa Page. Also involved in those discussions was the FBI’s top counterintelligence agent, Bill Priestap, Baker recalled.

SSA 1 told the OIG that the briefing provided him “the opportunity to gain assessment and possibly have some level of familiarity with [Flynn]. So, should we get to the point where we need to do a subject interview…I would have that to fall back on.”

The SSA 1 agent was asked to explain what he meant by “assessment,” and he responded:

[Flynn’s] overall mannerisms. That overall mannerisms and then also if there was anything specific to Russia, or anything specific to our investigation that was mentioned by him, or quite frankly we had an …investigation, right. And any of the other two individuals in the room, if they, any kind of admission, or overhear, whatever it was, I was there to record that.

Baker, meanwhile, told the OIG that he didn’t raise any concerns about using SSA 1 as the briefer because “[h]e was not there to induce anybody to say anything…. He was not there to do an undercover operation or … elicit some type of statement or testimony …. He was there on the off chance that somebody said something that might be useful.”

Baker further conceded that the benefit of placing SSA 1 at the briefing was to see if anyone at the briefing said anything of relevance to the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane probe of alleged collusion.

Baker stated:

[I]f somebody said something, you want someone in the room who knew enough about the investigation that they would be able to understand the significance of something, or some type of statement, whereas … a regular briefer who didn’t know anything about that might just let it go, and it might not even register with them. And so … that was the reason to have [SSA 1] there.

Baker’s reference to “somebody” clearly meant anyone at the briefing, perhaps even Trump himself.

The IG report documents how the conversation between SSA 1, Trump and Flynn was memorialized in an Electronic Communication (EC) and filed away inside the Crossfire Hurricane file.

The report states that “woven into the briefing summary are questions posed to SSA 1 by Trump and Flynn, and SSA l’s responses, as well as comments made by Trump and Flynn.” Earlier the report referenced two questions from Trump that was documented in the file.

The language in the IG report indicated that the office was taken aback by the use of SSA 1 to brief Trump and Flynn.

It stated:

We asked Baker whether he recalled any discussion about the potential chilling effect on, and the FBI’s participation in, future presidential transition briefings if the FBI’s use of SSA 1 in this manner became known. Baker told us that he did not recall that issue being discussed, and added that the use of SSA 1 was focused on the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation and Russian activities, including any directed at the Trump campaign; it was not the intention to collect any “political intelligence about campaign strategy, about campaign personalities, or anything that could be used in any political way.”

A few paragraphs earlier, the report stated:

We asked SSA 1 whether he was aware of any discussions within the FBI about the appropriateness of the FBI using an ODNI strategic intelligence briefing for a presidential candidate, organized by the [Office of the Director of National Intelligence] as part of the presidential transition process, as an opportunity to gather potentially relevant investigative information about or from a staff member who is the subject of an FBI investigation. SSA 1 responded that he did not recall if there were any such discussions, but that if there were, they would have occurred at levels above him. He also told us that he did not personally have any concerns with the plan.

This episode isn’t the only time an FBI member surreptitiously met with Trump without telling him that he was being investigated and then proceeded to memorialize the conversation in the case file investigating the Trump campaign.

As Breitbart News first reported, a different IG report provided new context to Comey’s infamous classified briefing to then President-elect Donald Trump about “salacious” material inside the anti-Trump dossier.

That IG report relates that prior to the briefing, FBI members on Comey’s team discussed the need to memorialize the exchanges between Comey and Trump during the private January 6, 2017 briefing in Trump Tower just in case Trump made statements relevant to the agency’s Russia probe. In other words, they plotted to stealthily use statements Trump said to Comey in a private briefing to inform their Russia collusion investigation.

The IG further relates that Comey went on to do just that. He had a laptop waiting for him in the car, where he immediately began memorializing the private talk. He also immediately provided a “quick download” of the Trump briefing to members of the FBI’s Russia collusion team via a secured video conference.

147,Maxine Waters: Americans ‘Where Are You?’ — ‘I Don’t Hear Enough Voices’ Resisting Trump,['Pam Key'],"Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) said Tuesday on MSNBC that not enough Americans are resisting and speaking out against President Donald Trump.

Waters said, “The American people should be focused on Barr. We should be joining with all of those federal prosecuting attorneys that have decided he should step down, that he should resign. We should be supporting them and backing them up. I’m anxious to see what the federal judges who have decided they can’t wait until the yearly association meeting, that they should pay attention to what is going on now and review what has happened. I’m anxious to see what they’re going to come out with.”

She continued, “But the American public should get behind this if they care anything about our democracy. You know, for all of those people who say that they, you know, honor the flag and that they are in support of our democracy being strengthened, for all of those people who say that—where are you? Can’t they see what is happening? We’re in a constitutional crisis in this country, with a president who is running amok. He is out of control. We have got to make sure that he’s not reelected. We have to speak up, we have to resist. I don’t hear enough voices.”

She added, “It is not only the sycophants around him, it’s the average American who gets up every day, who is taking care of their families, who is thinking somebody else will see to it that this president is not re-elected. But, no, it has to be all of us out there working and working very hard. We have a constitutional crisis and we’ve got to deal with it. This is what democracy is all about, when you see a president out of control, when you see those who have been elected to office, who are not acting responsibly and they’re endangering our democracy, you have to speak out against them. You have to work against them. You have got to make sure that they’re not reelected ever again.”

148,"CEOs Keep 1 Million Indian Graduates in U.S. Jobs, Legally",['Neil Munro'],"U.S. employers have quietly converted an imported army of 451,000 Indian temporary workers into permanent U.S.-based workers by merely nominating them to join the multi-year line to become legal immigrants.

This stealthy inflow of white-collar visa workers was revealed in a February 10 press release from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The release provides the missing piece in a puzzle that shows how at least one million non-immigrant Indians now hold jobs as temporary contract workers in Americans’ white-collar workplaces.

The establishment media ignores this Indian labor force within the United States. But it is very visible to the many U.S. graduates who are fired, displaced, or “re-badged” from a huge variety of middle-class jobs in software, accounting, management, recruitment, design, engineering, and even regulatory enforcement. This labor force also suppresses salaries for college graduate Americans, even as President Donald Trump boasts of a “blue-collar boom.”

The Indian labor force is so large that many American graduates now work in Indian-run offices throughout corporate America, and especially in Silicon Valley. In those offices, the mass of Indian workers and managers has pushed out many Americans, has replaced U.S. professionalism with Indian-style workplace politics of caste and ethnic alliances, deference to managers, blame-shifting, kickbacks, and hostility to outsiders, according to numerous reports and lawsuits, as well as statements by Indian participants and by U.S. witnesses to Breitbart News.

“Now it’s like most of the managers coming in are Indian, so it is very hard for an American to get hired,” an experienced Silicon Valley engineer and manager told Breitbart News.

Americans get screened out from jobs even before the interview process, he said. “I know at one point there was a woman that was an Indian woman who was in the human resources department. … She was sorting through the resumes and all we got … was resumes from India.”

“Even in the interview process, the Americans are screwed,” he added:

When the interview process comes along, guess what? They’re gonna have three people from India and three people from America [interviewing the job seeker]. The three people from India are all going to vote the same. They’re going to pick their Indian guy and they’re going to say ‘Yep that’s our guy,’ and the Americans are gonna go back and forth. Guess who’s going to get hired? It’s such a skewed system.

India’s 4,000-year-old caste system pressures and enables Indians to exclude Americans — and to separate Indians from Americans’ society — in violation of U.S. workplace laws, he said. “We don’t have a caste [system]; we’re not part of their caste system, so we [individuals] have no caste. … You might as well be an untouchable. … I think that’s what they do is they [say], ‘You don’t have a caste; you are the lowest caste.’ And so they treat you that way.”

“Americans are culturally oblivious to this idea that something so Third World would be in the United States,” said Jay Palmer, a former technology worker who now helps India’s mistreated visa workers to sue U.S.-based corporations. “I’ve had so many Indians tell me it is an Indian Mafia — they use those words.” He continued:

I have hundreds of Indian workers coming to me to complain that they have to give part of their salary to Indian hiring managers out of gratitude [for getting their jobs], whether $5 to $10 an hour. … There are some Indian managers — I can prove this — making upwards up to $15,000 to $20,000 a month in kickbacks.

The Indian white-collar labor market in the United States is far bigger than prior estimates, or the 451,000 Indians nominated for green cards in the last ten years.

For example, the Department of State issued 399,686 non-immigrant visas to Indians in 2009 — but that number rose to 1,006,802 Indian visas in 2018. In 2017, Indian workers sent almost $12 billion back to India, so reducing consumer spending in many American cities and towns.

The U.S.-Indian Outsourcing Economy is also a hidden political headache facing Trump when he flies into India for trade talks in February 2020.

India’s government is trying to protect the outsourcing economy. It has repeatedly suggested that it will cut its U.S. imports — such as oil, aerospace products, and grain — and will restrict operations by U.S. firms in India if Trump or Congress cuts the flow of Indian visa workers into the United States.

“The flow of talent is part of our economic cooperation,” India’s External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said in December 2019:

It is in a sense almost strategic bridge between us. So, I cannot overstate the importance of the flow of talent for Indo-American ties. That was a point I make that look, this is important for you, it is important for us. It’s important for the relationship. So let’s work together to make sure this stays sort of open and vibrant and active.

In 2015, for example, India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, held a public meeting in Silicon Valley with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Many Indian tech workers went to the event, which was also a demonstration of India’s growing clout in Americans’ technology industry.

325,000 Indian H-1B Workers

Indians get roughly two-thirds of new H-1B visas, each of which lasts for six years. The program brings in roughly 100,000 contract workers each year, creating a resident population of roughly 500,000 H-1B workers, including about 325,000 Indians. The workers are not immigrants — they are contract workers imported for up to six years.

This huge gig-worker, white-collar labor force is imported into the United States by many categories of companies.

Amazon, Google, Intel, Facebook, Bloomberg, and other elite firms import many expert Indians and Chinese for many jobs sought by Americans. Major banking, insurance, airline, manufacturing, accounting, retail, and finance firms import Indians. Many elite universities, hospitals, and research centers import Indians, partly because non-profit employers have no cap on the number of H-1Bs they can import.

Many small firms import small numbers of graduates. This category includes firms, such as architecture firms, where American graduates once got their first jobs.

Roughly ten major Indian staffing firms import many Indian graduates so they can be rented to the American firms who do not want to hire Indian graduates directly. Americans managers favor the outsourcing contracts because the staffing companies offer to reduce their management tasks, their payroll spending, and their human resources staffing tasks.

The hiring companies and their locations can be tracked at MyVisaJobs.com. The political districts where the workers hold jobs can be tracked at SAITJ.org and H1bFacts.com.

These 320,000 Indian H-1B workers are supposed to go home after six years, theoretically limiting their numbers.

But H-1B contract workers can stay if they get green cards from their employers — although the pro-diversity “country caps” in the law means that only about 30,000 Indian workers and family members can get green cards each year.

So roughly 75,000 Indian workers — plus 75,000 spouses and children — got green cards between 2013 and 2017.

But Congress opened another loophole by allowing companies to sponsor as many visa workers as they wish each year — and by allowing the sponsored “temporary” contract workers to remain permanently in the United States.

So companies have nominated 52,009 Indian employees for green cards in 2019, 59,499 in 2018, and 51,261 in 2017 — and 451,000 Indians since 2009. That total was three times the number of Indian workers who could get green cards during the ten-year period described by DHS — and so it created a huge backlog.

The employers and the Indians know about the country cap. Yet they cooperatively created the multi-year backlog for green cards because the Indian workers prefer to stay in the United States as contract workers instead of going home.

The willingness to use the loophole has created a backlogged labor force of 300,000 Indian workers — plus at least 300,000 spouses and minor children — who are willing to work under a legal status somewhere between contract workers and green card holders.

Their willingness to stay adds them to the Indian-born workforce in the United States, alongside the 150,000 Indians who have gotten green cards during the last ten years.

100,000 H4EAD Workers

Many of the 300,000 backlog workers are married. In 2015, President Barack Obama allowed their wives to get work permits, even without approval from Congress.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) 2019 data shows that roughly 100,000 spouses of Indian workers have been given work permits — assuming the work permits apply for two years. USCIS officials refused to say how long the work permits last. These H4EAD permits are intended to help the H-1B spouses keep their visa-worker husbands in the United States while they both wait for green cards.

150,000 STEM, STEM-OPT, CPT, workers

In 2018, roughly 250,000 Indians were recorded as having F-1 student visas in the United States, and they kept that status for about four to six years. But that growing population of ‘”students” hides a growing foreign workforce.

In 2018, 70,521 Indians held three-year work permits after enrolling for a technology degree at a U.S. university. This program is called the STEM-OPT program, or the Science, Technology, Engineering or Mathematics Optional Practical Training work program.

Many additional Indians got jobs using one-year work permits via the similar non-STEM Optional Work Permit and Curricular Practical Training (CPT) programs. These OPT and CPT programs add roughly 300,000 foreign workers to Americans’ white-collar labor economy. The government did not reveal how many OPT and CPT workers are not Indians. But there is much evidence that Indians fill many of the CPT and OPT jobs.

If just half of the Indians (who were not working as STEM-OPT permits) held CPT or OPT permits, that would add roughly 100,000 Indian college-grade workers to the U.S. economy.

50,000 L-1 Company Transferees

Many foreign temporary workers are imported via the L-1 program for the foreign employees of multinational companies. Some of the inflow is legitimate, for example, the workers who help install foreign equipment in U.S. workplaces. A significant number of them work for prestigious U.S. companies, but DHS releases little information about their nationality, duration, or work. These L-1 workers are paid home-country wages, often just at U.S. minimum wage levels.

The General Accounting Office (GAO) says 163,424 L-1 worker and L-2 family visas were awarded worldwide in 2017. That 163,424 number includes “all visa adjudications during the specific time period,” a GOA manager told Breitbart News.

The DHS releases some data about the roughly 40,000 L visas it oversees each year. The DHS data suggests the top 10 Indian-owned staffing firms keep about 8,500 L-1s in the United States, not counting the L-1 workers quietly imported via other companies or the State Department’s “blanket petition” process. The top ten U.S. white-collar staffing firms use many Indian visa workers and seem to keep around 6,000 L-1s in the United States.

The State Department says it issued 51,981 L-1 worker and L-2 family visas to Indians in 2016. Other State Department pages show that it gave 18,473 L-1 work visas and 23,230 L-2 family visas in 2018, plus 18,293 L-1 worker visas in fiscal 2019, plus 23,060 L-2 family visas.

A 2013 GAO report used State Department data to show that the top 10 Indian users of the L-1 program between 2002 and 2011 asked for 70,227 L-1 workers, enough to maintain an Indian workforce of roughly 40,000 workers.

Some applicants exploit the program and its threshold requirement of “specialized knowledge”. For example, the GAO reported that “one pattern of abuse is an L-1A manager hiring family members and appearing to manage them in order to corroborate their claim to be an L-1A manager or executive.”

So if each visa worker and his family stay only four years — instead of the maximum five or seven years — that adds another 80,000 Indians to the U.S. workforce. But not all the L-1s are white-collar workers, so the estimate should be dropped to 50,000 resident L-1 workers.

Uncounted B-1s

Indian companies also sneak in workers via B-1 visit visas. These visas do not allow the B-1 holders to do any work. But in 2016, the State Department said it issued Indians a total of 563,202 B-1 visas for business visits or B-2 visas for tourist visits.

This includes “B-1 in lieu of H-1B” visas, which are used by U.S. companies to import workers for several months. For example, Boeing reportedly used those visas to import Russian aerospace workers. Some Indian companies try to send Indian workers — officially less than 1,000 workers in 2010 — to the United States on these visas.

20,000 Miscellaneous

Each year, the State Department also issues 600 O-1 visas for Indians “with Extraordinary Ability or Achievement,” pus roughly 8,000 J-1 visas for Indian doctors, teachers, trainees, researchers, and academics. If 50 percent of the Indian J-1s stay for roughly three years, the J-1 program keeps roughly 20,000 white-collar Indians in U.S. jobs.

The department also issued 89 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) “TN visas” to Indians in 2016. These visas allow Indians to take U.S. white-collar jobs after getting a residency in Canada. This is the thin end of a growing trend because more Indians are migrating into Canada, where they can take advantage of the uncapped TN visa category for the residents of the three NAFTA countries.

Exported Jobs

The population of Indians in the United States helps Americans companies to export white-collar jobs to India. For example, 20 Indians who run a payroll office in Connecticut may work with 200 Indians in Bengaluru. This article does not count that population of India-based workers, which may exceed 1 million jobs.

For example, in September 2015, the New York Times reported how the U.S. Toys “R” Us company used just eight Indian visa workers to outsource much of its 67-person computer department to India:

For four weeks this spring, a young woman from India on a temporary visa sat elbow to elbow with an American accountant in a snug cubicle at the headquarters of Toys “R” Us here. The woman, an employee of a giant outsourcing company in India hired by Toys “R” Us, studied and recorded the accountant’s every keystroke, taking screen shots of her computer and detailed notes on how she issued payments for toys sold in the company’s megastores. “She just pulled up a chair in front of my computer,” said the accountant, 49, who had worked for the company for more than 15 years. “She shadowed me everywhere, even to the ladies’ room.” By late June, eight workers from the outsourcing company, Tata Consultancy Services, or TCS, had produced intricate manuals for the jobs of 67 people, mainly in accounting. They then returned to India to train TCS workers to take over and perform those jobs there. The Toys “R” Us employees in New Jersey, many of whom had been at the company more than a decade, were laid off.

India’s Illegals

Alongside the legal workers imported from India, there is also a large population of Indian white-collar illegals, plus some evidence that Indians firms use the programs to smuggle in extra workers.

The population of illegal migrants from India has grown enormously and is now pegged at more than 630,000 people. Most are likely working in blue-collar retail and labor jobs. But their ranks likely include many Indian graduates who overstay their visas after filing to get into win a visa in the annual H-1B lottery, or who cannot the college feeds needed to get another OPT work permit. Roughly 40,000 Indians were overstaying business, education, and tourism visas during 2018, according to a 2019 DHS report.

The scale of this Indian white-collar workforce is hinted at by a lawsuit against the DHS, following its 2018 decision to define an ‘overstay’ as anyone who stayed past their visa’s expiration date. But this new policy has been rejected by a judge at the request of employers in the education and software sectors. DHS declined to comment, saying, “USCIS is currently reviewing the court’s decision, and we have no additional comment to provide at this time.”

There is no data about the number of Indian graduates who are smuggled into the U.S. via the visa-worker programs. But there is much evidence that Indian managers routinely use fraud to import H-1B workers legally. For example, they claim their hard-to-find wants ads are unanswered, and that no Americans are available to do the work, even though many nearby Americans are eager for the job.

This endemic fraud has been described in lawsuits, U.S. government documents, GAO reports, embassy reports, and the U.S. Department of Justice press releases. The topic is described and debated by academics, plaintiffs, Indians, Reddit chatrooms, article commenters, and Public Radio International.

The promise of U.S. jobs — and even green cards — helps to explain why so many Indians try to get legal or illegal jobs in the United States. For example, Glassdoor reports that programmers earn an average of about $5,500 in India — but $75,000 in the United States. This means that a few years of work and penny-pinching in the United States can set up a young Indian for life.

One Indian manager told Breitbart News, when visa worker Indians return to India with their savings, “If you are a bachelor, everyone is interested in you,” he said. “You will have a car; you can have your own apartment. … You can not only get a good wife, you can win … a great dowry also [from the wife’s family],” he said, adding, “You are actually like a Maharajah.”

New Infosys lawsuit helps explain how the huge H-1B/OPT outsourcing economy pressures & rewards Indian managers to discriminate against American graduates, including Indian legal immigrants.

Follow the money, all the way to India.

And to Utah's #S386https://t.co/anISMObiu6 — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) February 5, 2020

Given the huge rewards, many Indians are willing to skirt or break U.S. immigration and workplace laws, often with help from other Indians, partly because U.S. salaries and green cards are so fantastically valuable.

The gulf between U.S. salaries and Indian poverty was spotlighted by a February 2019 report from the BBC about Indians who tried to game the system by registering for work permits at a fake, no-study-required university. But Farmington University was set up as a sting by DHS, and up to 200 Indians had to flee home when the sting was announced:

Veeresh had taken a loan of 1.5m rupees (£16,300; $21,000) to help pay for his [U.S.] education. The first university cost him $30,000 and Farmington cost him an additional $20,000. He had to borrow money from his friend to buy a ticket to come back home. He still hasn’t told his parents why he returned. “They think I am on vacation. But the truth is that I have no job and a college loan to pay off. My parents would be devastated if they knew the truth.” His parents are farmers and Veeresh had hoped to help them out by earning an income in dollars, some of which he could send home. “I am the only son. I wanted to take care of my parents. We do not own land or a house. I wanted to go to America to earn better so that I can buy a house for my family in India.”

These huge economic stakes help to explain why so many Indians are eager to transfer jobs and salaries from American graduates to their fellow Indians — regardless of the impact on U.S companies or American graduates.

Non-Indian Visa Workers

The army of Indian workers are hired alongside many other foreign white-collar workers, mostly people from China.

This diverse population — who tend to favor their own peoples — adds roughly 350,000 white-collar workers to the U.S. economy — not counting the 118,645 Chinese who were sponsored for green cards from 2009 to 2019.

For example, 478,732 Chinese were at U.S. universities in 2018. Of those students, 25,843 Chinese held three-year STEM-OPT work permits in 2018, and many others held OPT or CPT work permits.

Other Chinese hold jobs via the H-1B program, often at elite financial firms. Many Chinese also work as low-wage scientists — dubbed “post-docs” — in the nation’s laboratories and hospitals.

This army of white-collar visa workers is commingled with another category of foreigners who have short-term “Employment Authorization Documents.” These EAD workers include the Indian OPTs and H4EADs — plus many other migrants, asylum seekers, DACA recipients, green-card applicants, and various other categories. In 2018, their numbers added up to 2 million.

The Spreading Impact on American Graduates

“The Indians now control the IT labor market in the United States,” said a statement from Kevin Lynn, founder of U.S. TechWorkers. He continued:

Any American trying to enter the job market in IT will have to be screened by a recruiter that lives in India and further, be interviewed by an Indian manager. The result of these Darwinesque practices is on display to anyone visiting many of the Fortune 500 IT departments and call centers. The Indians have a preference of hiring their own, and in particular, hiring an Indian on an employment/guest worker visa because they are easier to exploit. Thus, the job market is rigged in favor of H-1B, OPT, and H4EAD workers from India. This is a disaster for equal opportunity in the workplace.

But this Indian labor-market is now spreading throughout the United States as the U.S. government invites more Indians into the United States, the Silicon Valley manager said. “Nothing frustrates me more than to see these people say ‘It’s an [just] an information technology problem.’ It’s not an IT problem. No, they’re taking everything.”

The Indian cartel exists because U.S-based Indian managers have the power to grant or deny Americans’ jobs to Indian students and workers, said Palmer. Without the U.S. job offers, the Indians must return to India’s poverty, he said.

Once the Indians have a job, he said, “their work-experience letters are held over their head for their next H-1B contract if they do not give their managers $10 an hour.”

Sometimes, the kickbacks are paid via nearby restaurants and gas stations that are owned by Indian managers he said. “I’ve had Indian workers [tell me they] have to go in there and spend in there an exorbitant amount on meals weekly,” he said. “If an Indian [hiring] manager has a gas station … [Indian employees] will have to run a debit card for odd amounts.”

U.S.-style professionalism is quickly discarded by Indian managers who prefer to hide problems, he said. In one episode, an Indian manager berated and insulted him when he pointed out a technical problem that their department had allowed into a company product. “I was going to the doctor at least once a once a month, sometimes two times, maybe more [and] I was taking pills to sleep,” he said, adding:

I was pro-H-1B when it first started, but then it got to a point [where] you get mistreated a few times and you realize, “Hey, these guys — you’ve got to protect yourself.”

U.S. CEOs prefer compliant Indians to American professionals, he said. “What they get out of it is they get control, because [American] person[s] can leave … They’ve got that [Indian] person under their thumb. And you know, if the person doesn’t work out, they can fire him and send him back to India. That guy’s got no recourse, [so] he’s a very safe asset.”

Indians are also moving into the top slots at U.S. corporations. The CEOs of Google, Microsoft, Adobe, IBM, and Mastercard are Indians. The chief technology officer at Walmart is an Indian.

There is no corporate desire to reverse the Indians’ growing dominance of major companies, the Silicon Valley manager said. “They don’t want to. Nobody wants to do that … The Chamber of Commerce? They love this thing. Big tech? They love this thing. There are a few people at the top that are getting rich on this [Indian] thing.”

Federal legislators will not try to reverse the Indian expansion, he said:

I’m sure they know. You talk to congressman and they’re like, “Oh my God, replacing Americans? Absolutely never gonna allow that! I would never allow that!” But they get in a room to vote and they go, “Yeah, no problem.”

For example, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) is pushing his S.386 bill to accelerate the inflow of Indian workers into the Utah and U.S. economies.

American college graduates are going to revolt against their replacement by Indians’ workers and managers, he said:

People are looking at [Sen.] Bernie Sanders they’re so pissed off about the system. They’re looking at a socialist government, and I’m going “You know what? Neither party has served me. So why the fuck not go with Bernie Sanders and get rid of all these [CEOs and Indians]?” Yeah, that’s kind of where we’re going [because] I think people are so pissed off.

In 2013, @SenSanders gave a powerful speech condemning the Gang of Eight bill written by corporate lobbyists. He then he voted for the bill despite being on record acknowledging that it would hurt American workers. https://t.co/6fPGwbcido — NumbersUSA (@NumbersUSA) February 14, 2020

“Americans want an immigration system that serves them and the country, not one that offers pro-business fixes to the problems created by the employers who are gaming the system,” said Jessica Vaughan, policy director at the Center for Immigration Studies.

“The fix is to create opportunities for American workers, not to continue to rig the system in favor of employers.”

149,Mike Bloomberg Claimed Young Men of Color 'Don't Know How to Behave',['Haris Alic'],"Democratic presidential hopeful Mike Bloomberg once claimed during a television appearance that an “enormous cohort” of young black and Latino males “don’t know how to behave in the workplace.”

Bloomberg, who at the time was in his final term as mayor of New York City, made the remarks at the launch of his multimillion dollar Young Men’s Initiative (YMI) in August 2011. The program, funded in part through a collaboration between the city of New York and George Soros, seeks to address the “disparities among black and Latino men between the ages of 16 and 24 in education, employment, health and justice.” As part of its launch, Bloomberg mounted a media campaign to stir up attention and enthusiasm.

One of the first stops of that campaign was an in-depth sit down with PBS News Hour. The televised interview, however, would prove to be problematic given Bloomberg’s use of language that can only be considered racially insensitive.

Bloomberg started off by saying:

For a long time people have said there is nothing you can do about [racial disparities]. Blacks and Latinos score terribly in school testing compared to whites and Asians. If you look at our jails, it’s predominantly minorities. If you look at where crime takes place, it’s in minority neighborhoods… who the victims and the perpetrators are, it’s virtually all minorities.

Bloomberg proceeded to argue that although great lengths had been taken to address the city’s crime problem, its root causes could not be addressed without expanding economic opportunities for young men of color. Which is where, according to Bloomberg, the YMI was to come into play.

The mayor said, elaborating on why he believed such individuals were unable to find work:

We’ve done a number of these kinds of things to try and attract the kind of jobs that are available to people, who maybe don’t have a formal education … or don’t have great command of the English language or have a blemish on their resume. Nevertheless, there’s this enormous cohort of black and Latino males, age 16-to-25 that don’t have jobs, don’t have any prospects, don’t know how to find jobs … [and] don’t know how to behave in the workplace.

When pressed for an example of how YMI would improve the lives of young men of color, the mayor struggled to provide an answer. While admitting there were some jobs that would never go to individuals with a criminal record, Bloomberg suggested reconnecting at-risk youth with their fathers might be one solution to the disparity YMI was created to address.

“But there will be jobs if we can get these kids, get their families together, even if their fathers don’t live with their mothers or [have] never been married or maybe, even, they’re in jail,” the mayor said.

“Lot of statistics show that if the father is engaged it gives the kid some understanding that he’s heading down the wrong path,” he added, before suggesting mentors could serve the same function.

Bloomberg’s remarks on PBS struck many, especially within New York City’s African American community, as insensitive and bled over into YMI’s public perception. The Village Voice, a prominent New York City tabloid, mocked the initiative as “the white mayor’s burden,” while questioning its feasibility.

Michael Meyers, the executive director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition, was even more direct, claiming the program was paternalistic and perpetrated problematic stereotypes of young black men.

Meyers wrote for the Huffington Post shortly after the initiative launched:

I am opposed to this Young Men’s scheme because the black and Latino community is dis-served by good-intentioned paternalism — such strategies … are doomed to fail because they are trying to sell hope through charity and group blame.

YMI and Bloomberg’s controversial advocacy of it on PBS comes back into the spotlight as the former mayor is under fire after audio resurfaced from a speech he gave at the Aspen Institute in 2015. In his remarks to the mostly white gathering, Bloomberg defended “stop-and-frisk” in words that can only be described as racially charged.

“It’s controversial, but … 95 percent of your murders, and murderers, and murder victims fit one [description],” Bloomberg says on the audio. “You can just take the description, Xerox it, and pass it out to all of the cops. They are male, minorities, 15-to-25. That’s true in New York, it’s true in virtually every city in America.”",https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/02/17/bloomberg-2011-young-black-latino-men-dont-know-how-to-behave-in-the-workplace/
150,Pete Buttigieg Promises Extra Housing — and Extra Migrants,['Neil Munro'],"Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s housing plan promises to help city councils replace suburban houses with apartment buildings — but his immigration plan would fill up those extra suburban apartments with more economic migrants.

Buttigieg’s housing plan says:

Housing supply, especially in high-cost cities, is often decreased by burdensome regulations rooted in historically racist single-family zoning policy. Pete will press cities to facilitate inclusive, community-oriented processes to set affordable housing strategies, including reviewing zoning and other locally-determined rules that may constrain new development. In municipalities with the highest rent burdens and most restrictive Pete will implement progressive restrictions of federal funding.

But he said, “This county needs more people than its immigration system is willing to allow” while campaigning in Carson City, Nevada. Buttigieg continued:

So what happens? The people come, but then they are endangered of all of the uncertainties of being undocumented in this country … On day one, we go to the border and we start managing the border in a way that matches our values, as well as our laws. With humanity and compassion as well as security.

Under current rules, the federal government annually imports roughly one million migrants and also keeps an army of at least two million temporary workers in the United States. The inflow has spiked housing prices nationwide.

According to Buttigieg’s policy paper:

In Charleston, South Carolina, a typical bank teller can’t afford to rent a one-bedroom apartment at the median price of $1,113. In Los Angeles, California, a bookkeeper or school bus driver can’t afford to rent a one-bedroom 2 apartment, which rents on average for $1,340 per month.

So Buttigieg’s apparently contradictory policy offers few gains to lower-income Americans and their young families. His housing plan would help reduce apartment prices — but his rush of extra migrants would trim Americans’ wages.

The result is more Americans and migrants will end up living in small apartments in subdivided suburban lots, emulating California’s housing crisis.

California's poverty rate is worse than Alabama & Mississippi, says Census Bureau. The major cause of this huge change is immigration policy which spikes housing costs & shrinks wages — and delivers huge gains for investors in real-estate & corp. shares. https://t.co/mEjCP83Hkr — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) September 13, 2019

But Buttigieg’s two policies would also combine to create a huge boon to construction firms, real estate firms, and local governments. His policy would allow them to crack open suburban zoning rules and then resell slices of suburbia to poor Americans and new arrivals.

That strategy is already being pushed by investor groups, such as the Economic Innovation Group. A booklet by the EIG group says:

The relationship between population growth and housing demand is clear. More people means more demand for housing, and fewer people means less demand … As a result, a shrinking population will lead to falling prices and a deteriorating, vacancy-plagued housing stock that may take generations to clear. … The potential for skilled immigrants to boost local housing markets is clear. Notably, economist Albert Saiz (2007) found a 1% increase in population from immigration causes housing rents and house prices in U.S. cities to rise commensurately, by 1%.

Tom Steyer and Elizabeth Warren have also backed the more migration/less suburbia strategy favored by the progressive alliance of investors and pro-migration ideologues:

Democrat & billionaire investor Tom Steyer says he will give cheap housing to many illegal migrants (plus jobs etc) – so raising Americans' housing costs.

His private house looks down on SF's Golden Gate bridge. Maybe he is just oblivious to housing costs?https://t.co/QZuykNTFjA — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 13, 2020

This policy is increasingly popular among pro-migration Democratic legislators in cities and states, but it is generating massive opposition from homeowners in Los Angeles, Seattle, and many other towns.

In July 2019, Politico covered the issue with the headline, “How Minneapolis Freed Itself From the Stranglehold of Single-Family Homes: Desperate to build more housing, the city just rewrote its decades-old zoning rules.” The article said:

Thanks in part to activists like [Janne] Flisrand and [John] Edwards, Minneapolis just did away with the rules that gave single-family homes a stranglehold on nearly three-quarters of the city. In December, Neighbors for More Neighbors, the group co-founded by Flisrand and Edwards about two years ago to address Minneapolis’ affordable housing crisis, won a victory unseen in any other major American city. The city council approved the Minneapolis 2040 comprehensive plan, which declares the city’s intent to abolish single-family-home zoning and allow duplexes and triplexes to be built anywhere in the city.

But the push to fracture is not popular. Politico said:

Single-family-only neighborhoods, a staple of city and suburban planning, are woven into the DNA of the American dream: the leafy, peaceful street lined with stand-alone houses, green lawns and plenty of elbow room. Minneapolis’ new vision of itself would essentially rewrite that code—reshaping the urban streetscape around walking and mass transit and rebooting the American dream to be more racially and economically inclusive. … But the mayor predicts the 2040 plan’s results will eventually vindicate his approach. “While people might hate my guts for a couple of years,” he said. “I’m confident that a little down the road, it’ll be apparent that we took the right route.”

The irony of the progressives’ policy is that housing prices tend to rise fastest in the non-diverse districts favored by the progressives whose income is cut the most by college graduate migration:

Americans must demolish suburbia to provide dense housing for the poor immigrants who should come through open borders, says pro-migration immigrant writer at the NYT.

Kicker: the author can't afford a suburban house like his dad bought in the 1980s.https://t.co/fMqsGmtvRj — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) February 8, 2020

Buttigieg’s housing policy also promised to revive policies created by President Barack Obama that encouraged poor Americans — especially black Americans — to exit valuable land in progressives’ cities and then move to cheaper housing in distant counties.

Buttigieg’s policy says:

Pete’s administration will direct federal resources and technical assistance to states and cities for the housing interventions that are right for them. … Pete will support states and municipalities in partnering with the private sector to provide workforce housing.

… Fully reinstate the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Rule. Reinstating this rule will ensure that states, local governments, and public housing authorities combat segregation, foster inclusive communities, and improve housing opportunities for individuals in need.

The Buttigieg plan also calls for a revival of the disastrous pro-housing policies pushed by Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Their policies got more immigrants and poor Americans into houses — but it crashed the economy once the poor people could not pay their mortgages.

Buttigieg says he will:

151,Pete Buttigieg Open to Idea of Raising Minimum Age for Gun Purchases,['Awr Hawkins'],"During a February 18, 2020, CNN town hall, presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg indicated he is open to the idea of raising the legal age for firearm purchases.

CNN host Erin Burnett pointed out that the Parkland high school attacker bought his rifle legally at age 19, then noted that Florida responded to the shooting by raising the minimum purchase age to 21.

She asked Buttigieg if he would support raising the age federally and he said, “I would be very open to that. We have to do whatever we can to save lives.”

Buttigieg also voiced support for an “assault weapon” ban and universal background checks. He claimed that “the vast majority, not just of Democrats, but of Republicans, and gun owners, already believe we ought to do.”

He said universal background checks have “eighty or ninety percent support in America,” and Congress still cannot pass it.

He did not provide any substantiation for his claim on gun owners’ alleged support for universal background checks.

On February 20, 2019, Breitbart News reported that over 90 percent of NRA member oppose universal background checks.

Former NRA president Marion Hammer used an Ammoland column to explain that the the views of NRA members are actually 180 degrees removed from those represented by the claims of Democrats and Democrat surrogates in gun control groups around the country.

Hammer wrote, “Over 92 percent [of NRA members] oppose background checks on sales between private citizens.”

152,Michael Bloomberg Proposed Ban on Baby Formula as NYC Mayor,['Dr. Susan Berry'],"As New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg demanded that mothers breastfeed their babies and insisted hospitals keep baby formula under lock and key.

In 2012, the current Democrat presidential candidate created the “Latch On” initiative, which exerted control over a mother’s decision on how to feed her baby.

The Daily Mail reported at the time:

Mayor Bloomberg has demanded that hospitals stop handing out baby formula to persuade more new mothers to breastfeed their babies. The New York City health department will monitor the number of formula bottles being given out and demand a medical reason for each one.

More than half of the city’s hospitals agreed to institute the Latch On program. Subsequently, those hospitals ended the practice of distributing free bags of formulas and baby bottles to new mothers.

With the support of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the campaign was presented as a health initiative for both mother and baby.

“With this initiative the New York City health community is joining together to support mothers who choose to breastfeed,” said Thomas Farley, city health commissioner.

WTVR reported Bloomberg defended the initiative, claiming it would make people healthier.

The proposed ban on baby formula arrived soon after another one on sugary drinks in large containers to control obesity. In 2008, Bloomberg also banned trans-fats in city restaurants and demanded menus display calories contained in each food item.

“Most of the public health officials around the country think that this is a great idea,” Bloomberg said of the baby formula initiative. “I gather that the immunities that a mother has built up get passed along to the child, so the child is healthier.”

However, some mothers complained about the campaign.

“It’s up to the mother to choose what’s right for her and her child,” said Lisa Tacy, according to WTVR. “I don’t think the government should be doing anything to prevent the mom from being a mother and making her own decisions.”

Ironically, a 1997 lawsuit filed against Bloomberg and his company alleged that he told an employee who disclosed her pregnancy to him that she should “kill it” in order to protect her career at his firm.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/18/nyc-mayor-michael-bloomberg-proposed-ban-baby-formula/
153,Report: NSC Official May Be Reassigned Amid Rumors She's 'Anonymous',['Kristina Wong'],"Top Trump administration officials are discussing reassigning a senior National Security Council (NSC) official to the Department fo Energy, amid speculation she is “anonymous” — the author who penned an anti-Trump op-ed that later became a book, according to a report.

Axios reported Monday that two sources familiar with the planning said that Deputy National Security Adviser Victoria Coates, who was elevated to the role just two months ago, could be transferred amid an effort by some within the administration to tag her as “anonymous.”

The outlet said her working relationship with National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien is “strained.” Coates reportedly denied being “anonymous” to colleagues, and one of the literary agents of the book released a statement that said Coates is not the author, did not edit the book, did not see it in advance, and did not know about it.

The discussions involve Coates potentially taking on a senior role at the Energy Department, according to Axios.

National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot told Breitbart News in a statement, “We do not comment on personnel matters.”

There have been several departures from the NSC in recent weeks. Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and his twin brother, Army Lt. Col. Yevgeny Vindman, were both reassigned from the NSC back to the Army.

Vindman testified during the House impeachment inquiry that he was so disturbed by the president’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that he reported it to the NSC’s general counsel along with his brother. He likely also spoke with the “whistleblower,” whose complaint launched the House Democrats’ impeachment effort.

O’Brien recently described their removal as his decision and part of a restructuring of the NSC. Under the Obama administration, the NSC ballooned in size. Ullyot told Breitbart News the restructuring continues.

“We remain on track to meeting the rightsizing goal Ambassador O’Brien outlined in October, and in fact may exceed that target by drawing down even more positions,” he said.

In October, O’Brien wrote in an op-ed that policy positions at the NSC would go from 174 to under 120 by early 2020.

154,"Shaun King, White Man Who Claims He Is Black, Stars in Sanders Ad",['Robert Kraychik'],"Shaun King — a self-described black man whose family says he is white — stars as an official surrogate in a Tuesday-published political ad released by Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) presidential campaign.

Millions of Americans voted “against their own self interest” in voting for President Donald Trump in 2016’s general election, declares King in the video ad published on Sanders’ official Instagram profile.

King describes himself as a journalist, humanitarian, leader, and activist against injustice, racism, and policies that criminalize blackness.

WATCH:

King is identified as a “civil rights activist” in Sanders’ ad as he reads the following script (emphasis added):

Bernie resonates in places where Trump won. Here’s the thing, to win this election you have to win the electoral college, and Trump won 30 states in 2016, and he won in places where Bernie actually crushed it in the Democratic primaries. Bernie won 71 or 72 counties in Wisconsin. Trump won there. Bernie won every single country in West Virginia. Trump won there. Donald Trump exploited real pain and problems in this country and began to scapegoat African Americans, immigrants, other marginalized communities, LGBTQ folk, as demagogues always do, and Donald Trump as a con man began making promises that he never intended to keep. Bernie said the Democratic and Republican establishment has failed people all over the country, and people feel that failure and take it personally. Donald Trump understood that and exploited it for his own gain. People were so agitated and frustrated and felt that this guy actually believed in them, when in reality it was just a con. So you have millions and millions of white folks in this country who voted against their own self interest. They need an elimination of medical debt. They need equal access to health care. There are rural communities all over this country where hospitals are closing down. There are counties all over the state of Tennessee where there’s nowhere to deliver a baby. When Bernie wins the nomination, Bernie is going to take this fight to Trump in all 50 states and fight to win the hearts, the minds and votes of everyday people all over the country.

Sanders’ campaign ad declares via chyron that the Vermont senator “will beat Trump.”

Sanders is regularly lauded as “authentic” by sympathetic news media outlets such as the Chicago Tribune, LA Times, government-funded NPR, Politico Magazine and Salon. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and the “squad” have similarly praised her own endorsement of the self-described “democratic socialist” senator’s presidential bid as “authentic.”

King aligned himself with various media-driven narratives, controversies, and campaigns, including support for Black Lives Matter, backing Colin Kaepernick’s kneeling protest against the national anthem, and praising the perpetrator of a thwarted mass murder attempt against an ICE facility.

After latching onto the Black Lives Matter campaign, King was dismissed by Black Lives Matter figurehead Deray Mckesson in 2015 over questions of “integrity” regarding activist fundraising.

In 2019, Black Lives Matter activist Mckesson accused King of a “lapse in integrity” related to the latter’s political fundraising and leadership style.

King received a scholarship from Oprah Winfrey to attend Morehouse College, a historically black school. He later denied lying about his race in applying for the award.

The festivities of Christmas and Easter are used as “tools of white supremacy,” claimed King in 2015. In 2018, he derided Independence Day, July 4th, as a “sham.”

In response to questions about his racial self-description, King said he is “3/4ths” white in 2016, adding, “We are each complex racial characters.”

155,Afghan Special Operations Forces Partnering More with U.S. Forces,['Kristina Wong'],"Members of the Afghan Special Security Forces (ASSF) — the country’s primary fighting unit against the Taliban — are partnering more with American and coalition forces instead of becoming independent, a U.S. government watchdog testified recently.

Special Inspector General of Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) John Sopko testified during a February 11 Senate hearing that the ASSF are conducting fewer missions by themselves, despite the spending of hundreds of millions of U.S. taxpayer dollars to train them.

“We’ve put a lot of money in that. But the number of independent missions that the Afghan special forces are doing has gone down,” he said Tuesday during the hearing, which was convened by Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY).

SIGAR first published in a January 30 report from the last two years that showed U.S. and coalition forces are increasingly partnering, or assisting the ASSF, with their operations. It said the ASSF conducted only 43 percent independent operations in 2019, compared to 55 percent independent operations in 2018.

The report also said although enemy-initiated attacks during the fourth quarter of 2019 reached the highest level than any fourth quarter of any year since the attacks started being tracked in 2010, the ASSF were conducting fewer ground operations at the same time than the rest of 2019.

Asked by Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) if there were any trends that show that the Afghan security forces would be one day able to fend off the Taliban and other terrorists itself, Sopko responded there was no way to tell.

“That’s the $64,000 — [or] $64 million question, I can’t answer that, I really can’t,” he observed.

Since 2002, the U.S. has spent almost $86.4 billion to help the Afghan government provide security in Afghanistan, according to SIGAR’s report.

For 2020, Congress has appropriated more than $4 billion to train Afghan forces, and authorized nearly $730 million of that for Afghan special operations forces.

SIGAR said they began tracking the number of independent ASSF operations after the Pentagon began using it as an important success indicator for the Afghan forces and the effectiveness of the U.S.’s “small-footprint military campaign” in Afghanistan.

A spokesman for the U.S.-led training mission said Afghan special operations forces did roughly the same amount of independent operations in 2018 and 2019, but increased partnered operations beginning around June 2019 to put more pressure on the Taliban and other terrorists — accounting for the higher percentage of partnered operation.

“This reflects an increase in ASSF capability rather than an inability to operate independently,” he told Breitbart News in an email.

He pointed to statistics in SIGAR’s January 30 report that showed beginning after June 2019, there was a big drop in the percent of independent operations and an increase in partnered operations. However, the statistics also show a big drop in operations after June 2019 overall.

(Source: SIGAR quarterly report to Congress, January 30, 2020)

Compared to statistics in a Defense Department report, the ASSF appears to have conducted more operations during roughly that same period in 2018, both in independent and partnered operations.

(Source: Department of Defense report to Congress, December 2018)

Sopko predicted that the data on Afghan special operations forces would probably not be available in the future since it seemed that metrics that showed negative progress in the war either get abandoned or become classified.

“Now, I am not a betting person, but I will bet you that next quarter, that database will be classified, because every time we find something that looks like it’s going negative, it gets classified or it’s no longer relevant,” he said.

According to SIGAR’s report, the information about Afghan forces that have become classified or no longer publicly releasable includes casualty figures, total numbers, and performance assessments.

Sopko said it is not even known how many Afghan soldiers and police there are and the U.S. is paying for.

“Apparently, it’s all secret, classified and I can’t tell you what the results are. … We have a whole list of everything that’s been classified and it keeps growing,” he said.

The observation prompted Hawley to question how Congress could perform oversight without access to such data.

“That’s the point we’ve been trying to make over the last five or six years,” Sopko responded.

Sopko also testified there is some concern that the Afghan special operations forces were being overused or “burned up” — which, with more partnered operations, could be taking a toll on their trainers, the Army Special Forces.

According to a U.S. Army website, Afghan special operation battalions, or “kandaks,” are primarily built and developed by Army Special Forces.

“Army Special Operations have assisted in growing this force to 10 [special operations kandaks] divided between two brigades under the Afghan National Army Special Operations Corps (ANASOC) headquarters,” it said.

Twelve of 18 American combat deaths in Afghanistan since 2018 were Special Forces soldiers — or 67 percent.

Sen. Paul said in his opening statement at the hearing:

Congress needs to do its duty and decide whether to continue America’s longest war. Congress needs to debate what the mission in Afghanistan is today. Congress needs to vote on whether to continue the war in Afghanistan. One generation cannot bind another generation to war and should not. We now have soldiers fighting who were born after the 9/11 attacks. We need to reexamine what our mission is in Afghanistan.

Dan Caldwell, senior adviser to the conservative organization Concerned Veterans of America, noted there were so many members of the public at the hearing there was standing room only but that less than a handful of senators showed up.

“That’s incredibly disappointing to me. This is the nation’s longest war, we still have Americans dying and being wounded in Afghanistan almost on a weekly basis,” he said. “This should be a priority issue for every single senator.”

He said the data about Afghan special operations forces caught his attention. “That’s one of our priority training missions. And that shows me that our current strategy there around training Afghan security forces is failing.”

156,Fitton: Judicial Watch Sues FBI for Seth Rich Records,['Tom Fitton'],"I know many Americans remain concerned about the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich.

We know that the Seth Rich controversy came up in Peter Strzok-Lisa Page emails we just uncovered. In a heavily redacted August 10, 2016, email exchange, Strzok sends Page a forwarded message from unidentified agents from the FBI’s Washington Field Office (WFO) discussing Rich.

A public affairs official whose name was redacted opens the WFO email chain, writing:

Various news outlets are reporting today that Julian Assange suggested during a recent overseas interview that DNC Staffer, Seth Rich was a Wikileaks source, and may have been killed because he leaked the DNC e-mails to his organization, and that Wikileak’s was offering $20,000 for information regarding Rich’s death last month. Based on this news, we anticipate additional press coverage on this matter. I hear that you are in class today; however, when you have a moment, can you please give me a call to discuss what involvement the Bureau has in the investigation.

An unidentified WFO agent responds: “I’m aware of this reporting from earlier this week but not any specific involvement in any related case.”

An unidentified WFO agent subsequently writes deputy assistant director in the bureau’s Counterintelligence Division Jonathan Moffa and Strzok: “Just FYSA. I squashed this with [redacted]”.

Strzok then forwards the email chain to Page.

Now, seeking the full truth, we have filed a FOIA lawsuit against the FBI for all records related to Rich, who was the Democratic National Committee (DNC) Voter Expansion Data Director.

Rich, 27, was murdered on July 10, 2016, according to the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia. The DC police reported that Rich was killed at approximately 4:19 a.m. in the 2100 block of Flagler Place NW, Washington, DC.

No one has been charged in connection with Rich’s death. The DC police are offering a $25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible.

We filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia after the FBI failed to respond to our July 26, 2019, FOIA request seeking all records related to Rich and his murder (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:20-cv-00385)).

There is significant public interest in the Seth Rich murder, and the FBI’s game-playing on document production in this case is inexcusable.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/18/fitton-judicial-watch-sues-fbi-for-seth-rich-records/
157,"Illegal Acquitted for Kate Steinle Murder Deemed Mentally Ill, Unfit for Trial",['John Binder'],"The seven-time felon, five-time deported illegal alien acquitted for 32-year-old Kate Steinle’s murder in 2017 will not stand trial on federal gun charges after a California court has deemed him mentally ill.

Following Steinle’s 2015 killing on a pier in San Francisco, illegal alien Jose Garcia Zarate was charged with her murder after being caught on surveillance footage running from the shooting. After his arrest, Zarate admitted to shooting and killing Steinle, who was walking on the pier at the time with her father, saying he chose San Francisco because it was a sanctuary city that shields criminal illegal aliens from arrest and deportation by federal immigration officials.

Now, after his acquittal of Steinle’s murder, Zarate is facing federal criminal charges for illegal possession of a firearm. Zarate has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Records from last week reveal that a California court is declaring Zarate mentally ill and thus unable to stand trial for the charges, as FOX 5 San Diego reported:

A court evaluator concluded Jose Ines Garcia Zarate is not competent to stand trial on federal gun charges “because of a mental illness that is not presently being treated,” according to a court document from the US District Court in California. [Emphasis added] … “If neither side disputes the evaluator’s conclusion, the Court wishes to explore … what efforts should be made locally to restore the defendant to competency through proper medication, as opposed to sending the defendant to a federal facility outside California,” according to court documents dated February 14. [Emphasis added]

The defense and prosecution are set to meet this week to discuss the matter.

Illegal aliens facing trial, as Breitbart News has chronicled, increasingly have used the defense of being insane, mentally ill, and mentally disabled to escape maximum sentences for murder.

In the case of illegal alien Wilbur Ernesto Martinez-Guzman — accused of murdering four Americans in Reno, Nevada — the defense is expected to claim that Martinez-Guzman is “mentally disabled” to avoid the death penalty if he is convicted.

Likewise, the 34-year-old illegal alien Apolinar Altamirano, an alleged self-proclaimed member of the Sinaloa Cartel, accused of murdering 21-year-old gas station clerk Grant Ronnenbeck in cold blood in January 2015, will not be eligible for the death penalty after he successfully got himself declared “intellectually disabled.”

158,Illegal Alien Charged with Raping 13-Year-Old Girl in Missouri,['John Binder'],"An illegal alien in St. Francois County, Missouri, is facing charges for allegedly anally raping a 13-year-old girl in 2018 and intimidating witnesses set to testify against him.

Manuel Avalos, a 38-year-old illegal alien, was indicted this month after a grand jury charged him with first-degree statutory sodomy involving a child under the age of 14 and felony tampering with a witness, according to the Daily Journal Online.

Avalos, according to prosecutors, in 2018 was staying at the same home as a 13-year-old girl when he allegedly sexually assaulted her. The girl told law enforcement she fell asleep on a couch before she was awakened by Avalos pulling her pants down.

After Avalos was charged in November 2019 for allegedly anally raping the girl, he was booked into a local jail and held on $100,000 bail. Less than a month after his arrest, prosecutors say Avalos threatened a potential witness in the case with a lawsuit and arrest.

Local law enforcement officials confirmed in an arrest warrant that Avalos has been placed on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer so that if he is released from jail, he will be turned over to federal immigration agents for arrest.

Avalos is facing a sentence of up to life in prison for the alleged child rape.

159,Venezuela’s Maduro Announces Permanent War Games Against Trump,['Frances Martel'],"Socialist Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro announced late Monday that he would order “surprise” war games to plan for attacks against the United States on a “permanent” basis following the conclusion of the latest exercises.

Maduro, who ceased being the legitimate head of state of Venezuela in January 2019, regularly claims that Washington is planning a military invasion against him, or that it has orchestrated various alleged assassination attempts to remove him from power. Maduro had ordered the organizing of “Bolivarian Shield 2020” exercises last week to prepare for alleged upcoming “terrorism” on the part of the United States.

“I hereby announce that the ‘Bolivarian Shield 2020’ military exercises will remain active and we will surprise,” Maduro said on Monday, in public remarks meant to commemorate the end of the war games. Maduro spoke alongside senior military leaders while wearing combat fatigues. “From today on, we will not announce the date of the military exercises nor the region.”

The broadcast lasted about an hour and included several impassioned interjections by Venezuelan socialist soldiers pledging loyalty to Maduro.

#EnVivo 📹 | Junto al Estado Mayor Superior de nuestra digna #FANB, hacemos Balance del Ejercicio Escudo Bolivariano 2020. #SomosPatriaInexpugnablehttps://t.co/DPkg8W4sTA — Nicolás Maduro (@NicolasMaduro) February 18, 2020

The purpose of surprise exercises, Maduro claimed, was to maintain combat readiness, denying soldiers time to prepare to show their abilities. They “could start at midnight” or any time of day, he added, and “this will be permanent so that we can have happiness and peace and security. With peace and security, anything is possible.”

The Venezuelan outlet Runrunes noted that Maduro suggested that hundreds of thousands of members of Venezuela’s military could be forced to participate in exercises at any given moment from now on.

Maduro made clear in the broadcast that the reason for seemingly random exercises was to protect from President Donald Trump.

“We don’t want war, we don’t want terrorism, we don’t want violence, but we are not afraid of fighting with arms in hand to defend peace, territorial integrity, and the future of Venezuela, let the world know,” Maduro rambled. “When Donald Trump two weeks ago said he was going to crush Venezuela, and he tells [Ecuadorian President] Lenin Moreno that he is going to take care of Venezuela, they convinced him it would be easy.”

Maduro appeared to be referring to remarks in Trump’s State of the Union Address in which he vowed to eliminate tyranny in the country. Speaking while acknowledging the presence of Venezuela’s actual president, Juan Guaidó, Trump said, “Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, a tyrant who brutalizes his people. But Maduro’s grip of tyranny will be smashed and broken.”

Trump also met with Moreno in Washington last week, stating that he would not attack Venezuela, but that he would help its people.

“Yeah, we’ll be looking at and talking about Venezuela. And it’s always close to our heart. We have millions of people from Venezuela living in the United States very successfully,” Trump said. “They love our country and they love Venezuela. We’ll take care of the Venezuelan people.”

“They have mercenaries ready in Venezuela and we will all surrender, all of us … that is what they convinced him of,” Maduro continued, without specifying the mysterious “they” who convinced Trump of this, allegedly. “That’s why he says ‘we are going to crush and break Venezuela’ and tells Lenin Moreno, ‘don’t worry about Venezuela, I’ll take care of it.”

Maduro’s henchmen joined the chorus of supporting military action against America in statements following the dictator’s remarks.

“Anything that happens, we will always be at the forefront with comrade President Nicolás Madro, next to the people, struggling for our independence and sovereignty,” Diosdado Cabello, Maduro’s second-in-command, said on Monday. Cabello is widely considered the head of the Cartel de los Soles, an intercontinental cocaine trafficking operation run out of the Venezuelan military, and lost a defamation lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal for publishing that information. Cabello is a career military leader and repeatedly stated on Monday that he would never negotiate with the United States or abandon Maduro. Cabello also spoke on behalf of U.S.-sanctioned drug criminal Tareck El Aissami, who Maduro put in charge of the nation’s key oil and gold industries.

On state television, socialist party councilman William Fariñas insisted that the constant surprise war games were “a reasonable response for the country before the attacks perpetrated by the government of Donald Trump against Venezuela.” Fariñas claimed that the original exercises forced 3 million soldiers to partake, allegedly the largest in history.

Fariñas also made the claim that 80 percent of Venezuelans oppose American sanctions and “coercive measures,” a claim not backed by the results of nationwide polls.

The Trump administration imposed new sanctions against the Maduro regime on Tuesday, this time against the Venezuelan subsidiary of Rosneft, the Russian energy company. U.S. Special Representative for Venezuela Elliot Abrams told reporters on Tuesday that Rosneft is “now handling about 70 percent of Venezuelan oil,” helping the Maduro regime access global markets and fund its repression of the Venezuelan people.

160,NSA Whistleblower Petitions Trump for Early Release from Prison,['Katherine Rodriguez'],"Reality Winner, a National Security Agency (NSA) whistleblower who was found guilty of leaking classified intelligence about Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election, is petitioning President Donald Trump for her early release from prison.

Alison Grinter, an attorney representing Winner, announced Monday at a press conference in Dallas that her legal team had submitted 4,500 letters of support to the federal office of the pardon attorney within the Department of Justice, the Guardian reported.

This is the branch that is responsible for advising the president on U.S. clemency or early release decisions.

A judge sentenced Winner to five years and eight months behind bars starting in August 2018 for violating the Espionage Act by slipping top secret documents to an investigative news website about the Russian hacking of local voting systems ahead of the 2016 election.

“Our country was attacked by a hostile foreign power,” The Intercept quoted Grinter as saying at the press conference.

Grinter continued:

Our national healing process cannot begin until we forgive our truth tellers and begin the job of rebuilding what was taken from us: election security, accountability for those who endeavor to undermine our democracy; and safeguarding the American right to government by and for the people. None of this can begin in earnest while we are still punishing those who tell us the truth.

The petition to Trump states that Winner’s imprisonment is “costly, unnecessary to protect the public, burdensome to her health and wellbeing, and not commensurate with the severity of her offense.”

The president commented on Winner’s sentencing in 2018, tweeting that Winner’s crimes were “‘small potatoes’ compared to what Hillary Clinton did,” and criticized then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

Winner told CBS News in a 2018 interview that she could not thank Trump enough for his tweet.

“I don’t like to assume anything as to what’s going on in his head, but the ‘small potatoes’ was a breath of fresh air,” she said. “It really made me laugh. It reminded me of me and my own family. We try to make a joke out of everything.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), said Tuesday on MSNBC that President Donald Trump’s “wet dream” would be running against 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful former New York City Mayor Micheal Bloomberg.

Chuck Todd said, “I got to assume there’s an opportunity for this campaign with Michael Bloomberg on that stage. I mean Elizabeth Warren’s campaign I would argue is framed around dealing with the Michael Bloomberg’s of the world not as a candidate, but the billionaires.”

Castro said, “Here you have Michael Bloomberg, basically someone that was once called by The New York Times as the most outspoken defender of Wall Street, and in Elizabeth Warren, someone who has been fighting for every day Americans for consumers, for folks who are losing their homes in the housing crisis. She’s been on the side of the American people. And Bloomberg has been making excuses for the status quo. So, tomorrow when they debate, you’re going to have two different visions for America. Hers is a vision that for all the rest of us, folks who work hard for a living, can prosper.”

He added, “He the closest thing we have to a Donald Trump on the Democratic side. If you look at his weaknesses.”

Todd said, “Wow.”

Castro said, “There are a lot of people out there that think that — maybe the best thing we can do is nominate a billionaire like Bloomberg because he has the resources. I actually think if you look at his record on race, on Wall Street, all of these sexual harassment complaints that were filed against him, and that he settled and has hush agreements with women on. He is actually Donald Trump’s wet dream. Donald Trump wants to run against the guy that has all of this baggage on exactly the issues where Trump can suppress the vote.”

He added, “I think he has the most baggage. In that sense, he gives Trump a real opportunity to win back the Electoral College.”

162,Trump Reinforcement on the Way from Tennessee in Bill Hagerty,['Matthew Boyle'],"President Donald Trump’s former ambassador to Japan, Bill Hagerty, seems like a done deal for the GOP U.S. Senate nomination in Tennessee, as despite a handful of other challengers that are not gaining traction, Hagerty has the full support of the president and first family.

What’s more, Democrats are not expected to—as they did unsuccessfully last time in Tennessee against now Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN)—field a serious contender like former Gov. Phil Bredesen. So that clears the way for Hagerty’s rise as retiring Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) heads for the exits after a long career in politics.

Perhaps more interesting than the specific contours of this race—again, for which Hagerty seems like a lock on the right—is the bigger context of how this fits into the broader future of the GOP under Trump and beyond the current president.

During the impeachment trial in the U.S. Senate, in the lead-up to the vote on whether to hear from additional witnesses that ultimately failed, clearing the way for the president’s eventual acquittal, Alexander waited until the literal 11th hour the night before the vote, issuing a just-before-midnight statement that he would be voting against additional witnesses. His statement included a slight jab at the president, saying he thought Trump did something wrong but it was not impeachable, but he was convinced of the case and did not need to hear anything else to eventually vote to acquit Trump, which he did on both Articles of Impeachment.

Alexander represents something of a bygone era in the U.S. Senate. Someone who championed big government bipartisan deals, he’s been around in politics for decades–first as governor, then as a U.S. Senator. His style evoked anger from the populist right, which tried multiple times unsuccessfully to defeat him in primaries, but Alexander eventually survived.

That all being said, Alexander is not as antagonistic to Trump as some other now former Republican Senators have been. Gone are the likes of the retired Sens. Bob Corker (R-TN) and Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and the deceased former Sens. John McCain (R-AZ) and Thad Cochran (R-MS)—replaced with Blackburn and Sens. Martha McSally (R-AZ) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS)—and all that’s left of the hardcore anti-Trump resistance inside the Senate GOP conference is the lone junior senator from Utah, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT). Romney, the failed 2012 GOP presidential nominee, voted to convict Trump on one Article of Impeachment and to acquit him on the other. His gripe seems more personal, those close to him say, than the portrait of a paragon of virtue that he and the establishment media who previously hated him have painted about his decision.

The U.S. Senate is a lot slower to change than other legislative bodies across the country. Elections come every six years, and many senators build entrenched brands and political machines in their various states—like Alexander did—and it is very tough to defeat a sitting senator in a general election, never mind a primary. The U.S. House GOP conference, under Trump, has already radically changed in the direction of the president’s vision. As Breitbart News has previously reported, more than 40 percent of House Republicans who were in office when Trump took over in early 2017 have retired, been beaten in elections, or are retiring.

But the Senate is, by design and nature, slower to change. That said, slowly but surely, the Senate GOP conference is becoming the party Trump envisions, and there’s perhaps no better example than Hagerty.

Hagerty worked on Trump’s campaign in 2016 and then later joined the administration as U.S. ambassador to Japan. The position was extremely important to the president, as Trump’s relationship with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe has been one of if not the most important of his presidency—especially as Trump builds an informal international coalition to stand up to the Chinese Communists in Beijing.

In a lengthy exclusive interview late last year, Hagerty explained his close relationship with President Trump—and how they have worked together on issues of grave national and international importance.

“I think it goes all the way back to the 2016 campaign,” Hagerty told Breitbart News. “The president—I was the victory chairman for Tennessee. The president knows I stood with him during the hardest times. The Tennesseean, which is the largest newspaper in our state, attacked me in a Sunday editorial trying to peel me away. I stood with him through the entire process. I was a volunteer but worked very actively to try to deliver the victory in 2016. Again, as a full-time volunteer, I worked very closely with him putting together good choices for him to select good people into the Cabinet. I got to know a lot of the people in the administration through that process. I retired from that job when the president went into office, because he had asked me to go represent him in what I think is the most important strategic ally we have right now which is Japan. I had the opportunity to work with many members of the administration—the president, most importantly—but many members of the administration. I developed a strong personal bond, and a great bond of trust, and that certainly carried into my effectiveness while I was in Japan.”

President Trump and his eldest son, Donald Trump, Jr., have both publicly endorsed Hagerty—Trump, Jr., was in Tennessee campaigning with Hagerty a few weeks ago—and Hagerty was the first and remains the only GOP candidate for U.S. Senate in a competitive primary that Trump has endorsed before he officially won the nomination.

His first television ad out in late January touts Trump’s endorsement too:

Another ad touts Trump, Jr., highlighting Hagerty’s support of his father and his father’s endorsement of Hagerty:

Hagerty has a unique story to tell, too, in that he would be the first U.S. Senator who actually worked in Trump’s administration prior to his election, should he win in November.

“The message is one that I think is quite important to hear. I think it’s one of the reasons that the president wanted me to do this job, has endorsed me to do this job,” Hagerty told Breitbart News. “I’ve been on the implementation end of our policies. I’ve actually seen them work. The president wants someone in the Senate who understands that. You’ve got someone in me who’s got a strong business background—I’m a lifelong business person—but also someone who has a great relationship with the administration and understand how to work with the president and work with his team and will have a unique voice in the Senate. I’m somebody who understands the principles behind our policies and somebody who can have the president’s back when it’s harder sometimes to get that through.”

Specifically, Hagerty’s job on the Pacific Rim—as U.S. ambassador to Japan in the Trump administration’s earliest days—put him at the center of perhaps the Trump administration’s biggest under-told story: how Trump has completely changed the game in U.S.-China relations, as the two world powers duke it out for geopolitical power and dominance, not just in the Asia-Pacific region but around the world as well.

“The alliance we have with Japan is critical in that we have more U.S. military stationed there than any place outside the United States any place in the world,” Hagerty said. “Japan is at the doorstep of one of the most strategic regions in the world, where over half the world’s population is in the Indo-Pacific region. It’s also the place in the world where I think we have our greatest threat and that’s not North Korea—that’s an immediate threat—but it’s China. Long-term, our big issue is with China. They’ve risen to become the second-largest economy in the world. They are threatening us at every turn, whether it’s economic, whether it’s intellectual property, or whether it’s the militarization of assets out there that have grown astronomically. It’s something that I think bears more discussion and more understanding. But I’ve been at the doorstep. I’ve dealt with China in the past as a business person, and I’ve worked with the president to help bring the threat to bear.”

Hagerty echoes Trump in relaying the concern that the United States and the West made a number of major mistakes with regard to China’s rise in recent decades, especially with allowing the communist powerhouse into the World Health Organization under President Bill Clinton and other historical errors in the past several years.

“We brought China into the World Trade Organization back in 2001,” Hagerty said. “President Clinton was in office then in the lead up to that. The aspirations were laudable, right? They thought that if we could get the Chinese to agree to the type of democracy that we have, to the type of capitalist system that we have, they would change. But I think there was some naiveté there, because they failed to put in tough and enforceable standards. So when the Chinese began to cheat, we began to look the other way. Politically, that was maybe the most easy thing to do, but it wasn’t the right thing to do for our economy or the world economy. People are upset right now about the trade war that’s under way with China, but if we dealt with this 10 or 12 years ago it would have been a lot better. If we waited 10 years again, it would have been far worse. So, the president has viewed this as a time to stand up to China. He’s talked about this from day one. He talked about this during the campaign, it resonated with me very clearly. I’ve had too many business dealings with China and too many of my friends have seen the actual result of their policies. The answer is really quite simple with the Chinese: they have got to stop stealing, and they have got to stop cheating. But you can focus on a number of areas—probably 5G and Huawei is the threat that I’d be focused on most. The threat that that poses to us is existential to us in some ways.”

Hagerty, in his role as U.S. ambassador to Japan, was critical in building—and then strengthening—Trump’s relationship with Abe, which was forged through the fires of several crises with not just the Communists in China but also the regime in North Korea. Trump, Hagerty told Breitbart News, has “changed the whole dynamic” in dealing with American adversaries along the Pacific Rim.

“The relationship with Abe has been absolutely critical. Abe is a strong leader. He’s been an excellent ally for the United States,” Hagerty said. “The president has changed the whole dynamic there. He’s even changed the lexicon. The terminology ‘leading from behind,’ or ‘strategic basins’—that’s out of the dictionary now. We’re standing firm. We’re standing strong there. When the North Korean regime launched two rockets over Japan, I was able to stand beside Prime Minister Abe and beside the foreign minister and say America is here to abide by our security treaty. We will protect and defend this region and we will bring the full force and weight of America’s strength to bear. I don’t know that my predecessors could have said that. I don’t know how to interpret ‘leading from behind.’ Certainly, the Japanese and our other allies in the region didn’t know what we meant by that. But now, we’re dealing from a position of strength and what we’ve done is chill China’s efforts to militarize the islands which they began during the Obama administration. It’s incredible what happened during the previous administration in terms of the Chinese militarization of one of the most important trading routes in the world, the South China Sea and also in the East China Sea where the Chinese were harassing the Japanese in 2016. When I got there in 2017, the situation changed completely because the president showed a very different side of America; Our strength, and our willingness to stand up. The Japanese joined us arm in arm, and if it weren’t for the strength of the relationship between the president and Prime Minister Abe we would not have been able to pass three consecutively sets of stronger sanctions on the North Koreans that brought them to the table. The president again changed the dynamic with North Korea. We’re no longer relying on other parties in the region. He’s now dealing directly with Kim Jong Un. We’re not relying on other parties in that region—there are no more six-party talks—and Kim Jong Un can do whatever he wants to with Russia or China or someone else, but we are now dealing directly with the situation. Have we resolved it to where we hope to be right now? Not yet. But we’re in a fundamentally different place.”

Hagerty intends to focus on 5G technology, and specifically the threat that Communist-China-backed Huawei represents to the west.

“Coming back to Huawei, and this is putting a businessperson’s perspective on the issue,” Hagerty said. “The national security threats with Huawei are pretty well-known and pretty well-discussed. There is a law on the books in China, I think it was put on the books in 2017, which requires any company in China to share their data with the central government. Huawei is a state-owned enterprise. Regardless of what they call it, 180,000 employees and they’ve got the balance sheet of the government of China behind it. This is a massive entity and they’re doing the bidding of the government of China. To allow them to come in and take a strategic foothold in the nation’s infrastructure—not just our nation, but our allies as well—we’ve got to do two things. One is we’ve got to work very closely with our allies to share with them the intelligence that we have that lets them know you can’t contain this by saying oh, we’ll check the software updates, we’ll escrow and check it. The tech is such that you just can’t do that. They talk about separating the core of the system from the edge, but if Huawei is into the edge there’s no way to keep that from penetrating and contaminating the core.”

But national security concerns are not the only issue, he says, with Huawei. He argues there are economic concerns with the Chinese tech firm as well.

“The other piece of it is economic,” Hagerty said. “This doesn’t get covered very much, but the economic piece of it from a businessperson’s perspective is so obvious. Why isn’t there a competitor in the United States that has a business product as strong or stronger than what Huawei is trying to offer up right now? Because they’re government-backed. It’s an un-level playing field. You’ve got the balance sheet of Communist China—if you’re in the business of allocating capital, which I have most of my life, you’re not going to stand up and try to compete against a bottomless source of capital coming from the Communist government of China. You’re not going to try to build a business you can’t compete against. They’ve already got a 180,000-person enterprise with this massive balance sheet. We’re expecting private enterprise to do what we do best: to innovate. But they’re going to avoid a space that’s contaminated by state-owned enterprises. So what did the president do? He kept them out of our arc. I worked very hard with Prime Minister Abe and the Japanese team to get Huawei and other state-owned enterprises out of the Japanese market. That’s the largest market in the world and third largest market in the world. I’m setting Communist China aside—they’re number two, and our competition too.”

This interview with Hagerty was conducted in mid-October, as the House Democrats ramped up their since-failed efforts to impeach President Trump. They did succeed in adopting Articles of Impeachment out of the House before Christmas, which they later, in January, transmitted to the U.S. Senate after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi withheld them for a month. That transmission sparked a Senate trial of Trump, which eventually cleared the president on all counts—he was acquitted by the U.S. Senate. But Hagerty said that even back then, during this October interview, the effort by Democrats in Congress to undo the will of the people in the 2016 election with the partisan impeachment push was only hardening support for President Trump in states like the one he intends to represent in the U.S. Senate.

“I talked with the president just a few days ago about this, he called to congratulate me on a good start,” Hagerty said in the October interview. “But we talked about how the impeachment was playing in Tennessee. Frankly, I think it’s been going on since the day after the election. I felt it this early as we walked through the lines of people yelling ‘Not My President!’ spitting at me, and that sort of thing as we worked to help the president transition from being a candidate to being the leader of the largest enterprise in the world. I think this has been going on since then. The latest move, this impeachment exercise, as I said to the president, I think has increased the intensity of support for him in Tennessee. What we see in Tennessee is an effort that just continually moves the goalposts but aimed at only one result: That’s to discredit this presidency and that’s to change the results of the 2016 election—they’re so unhappy with that. They’ll stop at nothing. So, it’s intensifying his support there.”

Hagerty said the Democrat Party’s “socialist agenda” terrifies him, and that he intends to be a leading voice against it in the U.S. Senate.

“Coming back to [the] reason I want to do this job—we talked about the reason the president wants me, to have a strong voice in the Senate and to have someone he has experience working with. I think I’m the only person who has a track record of working with him, certainly in my state in the primary I’m the only person who has a track record of working with the president,” Hagerty said. “But also, in addition to the president’s confidence in me and desire to have me there, why do I want to do this? Why did I feel compelled to come home? What I looked at is exactly what you’re talking about: It’s what’s coming out of Washington, the Democrats. It’s not just the impeachment and the effort to do something I think is very illegitimate which is to change the results of the election. But they have a socialist agenda they’re trying to impose on the nation. I have four children, four young children, I want them to have a world that allows them to have the same opportunities that I did. Democrats are doing everything they can to try to remove that opportunity. They’re trying to implement more government control over our lives, whether it’s through the Green New Deal, or whether it’s through Medicare-For-All where they’ll cause us to lose our private healthcare, it’s incredible the rhetoric that’s coming out of Washington. Somebody has got to stand up to it. Look at the immigration system. It’s an embarrassment to our nation. It’s critical and it’s damaging our economy and it’s making our nation unsafe. I have a brother, a 30-year law enforcement veteran in California. He’s dealing with MS-13. His life is at risk because of the policies that are in place that are coming out of the Democrat Party. They want open borders. They want to invite people in here and offer them free healthcare and free education. Those are all the wrong incentives. We’ve got to straighten out our immigration system and secure our borders first. We’ve got to eliminate sanctuary cities. Thankfully, the conservative legislature in Tennessee eliminated sanctuary cities. We have cities in Tennessee like Nashville that tried to create sanctuary cities, but our legislature stood up to them. You’ve got ICE that’s being disrespected. We’ve got to stand with ICE and all law enforcement like my brother in law, we’ve got to stand with them and support their efforts. We’ve got to build the wall. I’m going to come in and support President Trump in getting that done.”

He added that he wants to pursue policies that protect Christian conservatives and the right to life against forces pushing radical pro-abortion views.

“Tennessee needs and I think they want a Christian conservative running for this seat and representing them in the Senate,” Hagerty said. “With me, you’ll get a strong Christian conservative who’s 100 percent pro-life. I’ll stand for the Second Amendment. I worked with the great team to get Beretta to Tennessee, but I led that effort. You’ll have somebody who understands these issues with immigration and who’s going to stand with the president to address them. And you’ll have someone who over the long haul is going to stand to address conservative constitutionalism in office and confirming those types of judges. The president has done a great job—over 150 conservative constitutionalist judges have been appointed during his tenure. We need to continue that effort. That is so critical to our nation. Then, I think at the very end I think you’ve someone with business experience who understands what it takes to be successful in America and will fight back against these socialist anti-capitalist measures that are coming out of Washington that would destroy our country. I appreciate what a good job means to a family. I grew up in a family where my dad lost his job. I know what that feels like. I know how important it is for a family to have a good job and the dignity and self-respect that comes with it too. So I think that’s a perspective I can bring to bear.”

He also sees Blackburn, who replaced Corker, as a future ally in the U.S. Senate with whom he can work to advance President Trump’s vision for the country.

“I’ll have a great partner in Marsha Blackburn. She’s a terrific senator. She’s a great representative for us,” Hagerty said. “I look forward to working with her as a team to help the broader efforts by President Trump, but also every day to try to help the needs of Tennesseans. So I think that potential partnership with Marsha is very appealing to me because I think we’ll make a great team. The other thing is the president has got a known quantity in me and someone he can pick the phone up and call and help navigate and position resources in a way that will be effective. Do I need to come up and create some massive body of legislation? That’s not what I’m looking to do. I’m coming up to make a difference. I’m not looking to make a career as a media commentator or a lobbyist or whatever people might do. I’m only coming to make a difference for my children and the children and grandchildren of my constituents in Tennessee should I be lucky enough to do this job.”",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/18/exclusive-trump-reinforcement-on-the-way-from-tennessee-bill-hagertys-senate-race-highlights-presidents-takeover-of-gop/
163,Exclusive–Rand Paul: Trump Needs GOP Allies to End War in Afghanistan,['Kristina Wong'],"Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) said in a recent exclusive interview with Breitbart News that the president needs more Republican allies to help him end the war in Afghanistan.

“I think the president is sincere when he says he wants to end these long wars. He said a year ago at the State of the Union that great nations don’t fight perpetual war. He said this year at the State of the Union he was ready to bring the troops home, but he needs more allies,” he told Breitbart News last week.

“I’ve been an ally of his, Sen. [Mike] Lee has been an ally of his on this side, but many Republicans are in the, you know, there’s never been a war they didn’t like. There’s never been a war they wanted to end, and so that’s what we’re up against,” he said.

The senator recently accompanied President Trump to Dover Air Force Base to receive the bodies of two fallen U.S. Special Forces soldiers who were killed in Afghanistan — Sgt. 1st Class Javier J. Gutierrez, 28, of San Antonio, Texas, and Sgt. 1st Class Antonio R. Rodriguez, 28, of Las Cruces, New Mexico.

“It’s a very somber moment, very heart-wrenching to see our young men come home with their lives cut short. They were both in their late 20s, one young man had four children, small children,” Paul said.

He said the president does not necessarily need to bring all U.S. troops home from Afghanistan but should end U.S. combat missions in Afghanistan.

“You know, he’s talking about bringing troops, you know, lowering the troop level in Afghanistan, but really we just need to end combat missions in Afghanistan,” he said.

Paul convened a hearing last Tuesday on the Afghan Papers — a set of interviews of U.S. officials involved in the Afghan War, including some who expressed doubt over the strategy and whether progress was being made.

He said the hearing was a way to give justice to soldiers who have served there.

“I think our soldiers deserve better so this hearing is a way to really give justice to our soldiers who serve and say we really need to be debating what is our mission in Afghanistan, so we’ll probably do another hearing similar to this in about a month,” he said.

164,Donald Trump: I Know Who ‘Anonymous’ Is,['Charlie Spiering'],"President Donald Trump claimed Tuesday to know the identity of the “Anonymous” government official criticizing his administration in a New York Times op-ed and in a book.

Trump spoke about the individual that remains unnamed, despite some guesses at the identity of the protesting deep-state official.

“It’s not so much a search… I know who it is,” Trump told reporters prior to boarding Air Force One on Tuesday, as they repeatedly asked him to reveal the name.

“Can’t tell you that,” he replied. “But I know who it is. We won’t get into it, people know it’s a fraud.”

The official wrote a New York Times op-ed in September 2018 claiming to be only “part” of the “resistance inside the Trump administration,” describing the president as unfit to lead the country.

The official also published a book in November 2019 that warned that Trump “stumbles, slurs, gets confused, is easily irritated, and has trouble synthesizing information.”

But Trump appeared confident that he had rooted out the official responsible.

“I know all about ‘Anonymous,'” Trump told reporters.

165,Charlie Daniels: Mike Bloomberg Knows as Much About Farming as a Hog Knows About an Airplane,['Hannah Bleau'],"Country rock legend Charlie Daniels ripped Michael Bloomberg (D) on Monday after the presidential hopeful’s belittling remarks about farmers resurfaced, noting that the billionaire knows “as much about farming as a hog knows about an airplane.”

“Hey Bloomberg you know as much about farming as a hog knows about an airplane, so how are you going to teach somebody else how to do it, Better stay in NYC where corn comes in cans,” the “Uneasy Rider: singer said in a tweet to his 985k Twitter followers.

Hey Bloomberg you know as much about farming as a hog knows about an airplane, so how are you going to teach somebody else how to do it,

Better stay in NYC where corn comes in cans. — Charlie Daniels (@CharlieDaniels) February 18, 2020

Bloomberg’s past remarks about farmers, which he made during an Oxford University forum in England in 2016, resurfaced over the weekend. He told the crowd that he could “teach anybody, even people in this room, no offense intended, to be a farmer.”

“It’s a process. You dig a hole, you put a seed in, you put dirt on top, add water, up comes the corn. You could learn that,” Bloomberg said.

“Then we had 300 years of the industrial society,” he continued. “You put the piece of metal on the lathe, you turn the crank in the direction of the arrow, and you can have a job.”

He veered the conversation into the reality of the “information economy” and suggested that farmers lack the intellect or “gray matter” to keep up with the new economic realities and advanced technologies associated with modern life.

“Now comes the information economy and [it] is fundamentally different because it’s built around replacing people with technology and the skill sets that you have to learn are how to think and analyze, and that is a whole degree level different,” he stated. “You have to have a different skill set, you have to have a lot more gray matter.”

The remarks prompted sharp responses from both sides of the political aisle, from Donald Trump Jr. to Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) supporters to Vice President Mike Pence.

Bloomberg wouldn’t last 3 seconds as a farmer… but like his comments on minorities, you can tell he really hates regular hardworking Americans. He will never fight for them because he couldn’t care less about them. https://t.co/03CmskF5Vn — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) February 17, 2020

So God Made a Farmer 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/sbXSugMNyO — Mike Pence (@Mike_Pence) February 17, 2020

Bloomberg’s campaign has since claimed that the remarks were taken grossly out of context and accused the Sanders campaign of pushing out “falsehoods.” His campaign manager Kevin Sheekey added that Bloomberg has “traveled to 26 states” and “during that time, he has met with farmers and heard directly about the struggles they face.”

As Breitbart News’s John Nolte explained, Bloomberg’s denial is overwhelmingly weak:

Obviously, anyone who watches the original video, or who reads the full context of the transcript, knows Bloomberg was definitely not taken out of context — not even close. To begin with, he’s not talking about agrarian society as it existed 3,000 years ago, he’s talking about an agrarian society that lasted 3,000 years. Everything he says, everything he refers to, is in the present tense. This is made clear when he says, “I could teach anybody, even people in this room so no offense intended, to be a farmer.” He’s not talking about teaching people to farm 3,000 years ago, he’s talking about teaching them to be a farmer today. … The fact that he’s speaking in present tense is made even clearer when he says, “and the skill-sets you have to learn are how to think and analyze, and that is a whole degree/level different. You have to have a different skill-set; you have to have a lot more gray matter.” Again, he is not talking about how farmers from 3,000 years ago would lack the gray matter and skill-set, he’s talking about the “gray matter” problem with farmers (and factory workers) today.

166,Hollywood Demands AG Bill Barr Resign to ‘Restore Public Confidence’ in DOJ,['David Ng'],"The Hollywood left have taken out their pitchforks for Attorney General William Barr, demanding his immediate resignation in order to restore public confidence in the Department of Justice.

Stars including Alyssa Milano, Mark Ruffalo, Rosie O’Donnell, and John Leguizamo are encouraging their social media followers to sign a petition that accuses Barr of misleading the public about the contents of the Mueller report and making false statements to Congress.

Their demands echo those of Democratic presidential candidates, including Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, who are also seeking Barr’s resignation from office. Republicans are calling the coordinated attack a political hit job designed to weaken President Donald Trump and to prevent Barr from investigating the origins of the Russia collusion hoax.

The Obama-aligned group Protect Democracy has also launched a media offensive against Barr, telling news outlets that more than 2,000 former Department of Justice officials are calling for Barr to step down.

Alyssa Milano led the Hollywood charge, saying that Barr must resign “to restore public confidence in the integrity of the Department of Justice.”

Barr must resign as Attorney General immediately to restore public confidence in the integrity of the Department of Justice. Please add your name to this petition and pass it on. #BarrMustResign https://t.co/IYmezWvUpL — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) February 18, 2020

Actress Piper Perabo also fanned the flames by recycling the claims made by Protect Democracy.

If you watched the news tonight 📺 (I saw it on @AC360 + @maddow also reporting from @TheAtlantic @abcnews & @TIME) 2000+ former DOJ officials are calling on AG #Barr to resign.

Rosie O’Donnell also demanded Barr’s resignation, citing Harvard Law professor Laurence Tribe, who has pushed for impeachment since before Donald Trump took office in 2016.

Actor Mark Ruffalo echoed the push for Barr’s resignation, quoting an editorial written by Donald Ayer, former U.S. Deputy Attorney General under President George H. W. Bush.

Filmmaker Judd Apatow let loose a wild string of allegations against Barr, claiming that the attorney general is “part of a cult” and that he is being unduly influenced by religion.

People need to always discuss the religious aspect to his legal choices. He is part of a cult. His speech about religion is reason enough to impeach him. He sees all Democrats as enemies. https://t.co/xRMCEwu8WT — Judd Apatow (@JuddApatow) February 17, 2020

Actor John Leguizamo simply tweeted the hashtags #ResignBarr and #BarrResign six times.

Alec Baldwin tweeted a cryptic list of prominent conservatives and Trump supporters, adding Barr’s name to the top of the list.

167,Five Things Netflix’s Narcos: Mexico Gets Wrong,"['Ildefonso Ortiz', 'Brandon Darby']","The new season of Narcos: Mexico was released last week continuing the narrative of how the country went from small drug smuggling operations to powerful cartels with more influence than governments in some regions.

The series follows the rise and fall of Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, the founder of the Guadalajara Cartel who was able to establish a large-scale drug transportation operation for marijuana and eventually cocaine as Mexican drug lords overshadowed their Colombian counterparts. The fall came after Gallardo and associates murdered DEA Agent Enrique “Kiki” Camarena; a case that touched the highest echelons of Mexican politics.

While the show is a fictionalized version of events, several parts deviated drastically from known historical accounts, while others were plain factual errors. It is worth noting that in 2017, one of the location scouts for the series was killed in Mexico State, a move that put additional pressure on the studio when it came to dealing with glaring security problems. Below are five of the notable errors in season two.

Naturally, spoilers follow.

–Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo did not order the murder of El Guero Palma’s family. In the show, Enrique Clavel, who is Felix Gallardo’s driver, shoots the wife of the Sinaloa Plaza boss Hector “El Guero” Palma and throws his children off a bridge. The murder comes after Palma and Gallardo had a falling out over Gallardo’s refusal to prevent the murder of a drug lord named “Cochiloco” at the hands of the Arellano Felix brothers.

The true story is considerably darker. The murders were linked to the Arellano Felix family but not Felix Gallardo himself. According to George Grayson’s Mexico: Narco-Violence and a Failed State?, After El Guero Palma spent eight years in an Arizona prison following his first arrest in 1978, his wife Guadalupe Leija Serrano left him for Clavel, who was not Gallardo’s driver–but a Venezuelan drug lord. Clavel forced Leija to take out $7 million from her bank account only to decapitate her and send her head to Palma in an ice chest. Days later, Clavel took Leija’s and Palma’s two young children and threw them off a bridge along the Venezuela-Colombia border.

-El Guero Palma did not kill Clavel with a bat. One of the last scenes in the series shows Clavel working at a shoe store where El Guero Palma and Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman arrive with various gunmen. The series shows Palma beating Clavel to death and El Chapo spitting by his corpse.

In reality, following his family’s gruesome murder, El Guero Palma tracked Clavel’s three sons to Tijuana where they worked for the Arellano Felix brothers to have them murdered and dismembered. In a similar fashion, Palma had Clavel murdered inside a Venezuelan prison. Three other Clavel associates met a similar fate, according to Publimetro.

-Comandante Aguilar was Amado Carrillo’s boss, not his employee. In the show, a Chihuahua state police commander named Rafael Aguilar is seen as an underling of the eventual leader of the Juarez Cartel Amado Carrillo Fuentes, better known as “Lord of the Skies.”

Aguilar plays a minor role in the series, but in real life he was the co-founder of the Juarez Cartel along with Pablo Acosta. According to the Los Angeles Times, Aguilar died in 1993 in Cancun when a team of gunmen ambushed him and an innocent bystander from Colorado. The murder was allegedly ordered by Carrillo Fuentes who took over the criminal organization.

–Matamoros is not a beach area with hills, wrong restaurant name, and other Gulf Cartel errors. In one of the early episodes, Carrillo Fuentes travels to Matamoros to meet with the head of the Gulf Cartel, Juan N. Guerra. In one of the opening scenes, Matamoros is presented as a beach area with hills. The meeting between the drug lords takes place in “Restaurante Matamoros.” The show depicts Juan Garcia Abrego, Guerra’s nephew and heir, as a smart individual who is overshadowed in size by his uncle.

Dear Netflix, there is no way in hell this is Matamoros (the scene is too pretty), the restaurant was Piedras Negras, not Restaurante Matamoros and there is no Sheriff de Brownsville ‍♂️‍♂️ #NarcosMexico2 pic.twitter.com/ayQkXnbz66 — Ildefonso Ortiz (@IldefonsoOrtiz) February 15, 2020

In reality, Matamoros does not have any hills and is not a beach city, but is 20 miles west of one called Playa Bagdad. During his tenure as the Matamoros kingpin, Guerra held court at his restaurant Piedras Negras on Sixth Street, less than a block away from Reforma Theater. While the restaurant was known for its good fare, its fame came from being a place where average citizens and traffickers alike could request an audience with Guerra. Guerra’s nephew, Juan Garcia Abrego, was known for his large stature.

-There is no Brownsville Sheriff’s Department. In one of the scenes where Felix Gallardo is visiting Guerra, his nephew Juan Garcia Abrego mentioned that half of the Brownsville Sheriff’s Department would go to Guerra’s parties.

While the Rio Grande Valley has seen several border area sheriffs go to prison for working with the Gulf Cartel, there is no “Brownsville Sheriff’s Office.” Brownsville, Texas, is located in Cameron County.

168,"Nolte: ‘Fast & Furious’ All-Girl Spinoff Is Exact Opposite of Woke, Gender-Swapped Reboot",['John Nolte'],"Flannel, zombies, and The Fast and the Furious – that’s the full extent of my cutting edge credentials. Before flannel was a thing, I was wearing flannel. Thirty years before zombies were the rage, I was sitting alone in movie theaters watching zombie movies. Ten years before The Fast and the Furious became a billion-dollar global franchise, I was watching the first one on a practical loop. I love this franchise; have since the beginning, which means I feel somewhat protective towards my discovery. I don’t want to see it exploited and cheapened — which, sadly, has already happened…

Hobbs and Shaw…? Not so hot. While I certainly understand the studio’s desire to turn its biggest (and aging) franchise into a full-blown universe, Hobbs and Shaw was basically Dwayne Johnson’s empty-headed ego trip, a movie about nothing more than CGI and forced banter.

Unfortunately, Hobbs and Shaw also made more than $750 million worldwide, which means we will probably get more of the same; which is the long way of saying an all-female Fast & Furious spin-off, that we are told is in the works, could stink.

That doesn’t mean, though, it’s a bad idea.

What’s more, if this spin-off does come about, we should not make the mistake of lumping it into the growing pile of stupid, all-lady, woketard remakes and reboots we’ve been suffering through since the Ghostbusters went full-vagina.

To begin with, the Fast & Furious female characters are already well-established. From the beginning, and long before this woketard assault on human nature began, Fast & Furious gave us tough, independent, sympathetic, and sexy female characters capable of holding their own without sacrificing their femininity. What’s more, these are women who love men, who don’t hector and lecture about how useless and awful we all are.

As long as the spin-off remains faithful to that, why wouldn’t we want to see characters we already love in their own movie?

I do have one suggestion, though….

Would it be okay if the all-lady Fast & Furious dared to be a little sexy?

Hey, I’m not asking for porn or even nudity; I’m just asking for a little cleavage, some side boob, a tight dress, some T, some A… Come on, what’s the harm? If a woman is willing to be objectified and men are willing to objectify her, is that not a relationship between consenting adults?

I’m not saying you don’t give the girls some attitude and skills beyond their hotness. We want them to kick ass. I’m all for that… But this plague of sexlessness infecting movies today, this appalling Puritanism that was unheard of even at the height of the Studio Era and the Production Code… It absolutely sucks.

If I’m not being too candid, part of the fun of going to the movies is, was — yes, getting a little turned on.

Don’t you miss that?

I miss that.

So please don’t make the all-lady Fast & Furious only for girls; don’t make the same mistake Ghostbusters, Birds of Prey, and Charlie’s Angels made and proceed under the assumption there are enough brittle, dried-out, joyless feminists out to make your blockbuster a hit.

You need us, you need us guys to show up, and if you shit all over us, you will not only have another expensive woketard disappointment on your hands, you’ll mar the entire franchise.

You know, the Fast & Furious franchise is not a hit just because of all the stunts and action. It’s also a hit because it’s unpretentious and inviting; it’s the American melting pot in action without sanctimoniously announcing it’s the American melting pot. It’s about men being men, women being women, burning fossil fuels, and family.

Stay true to that, avoid the woketardiness, set it ten years ago so Gal “hubba-hubba” Gadot is able to return, and I’ll be in the front row on opening day.",https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2020/02/18/nolte-fast-furious-all-girl-spinoff-is-exact-opposite-of-woke-gender-swapped-reboot/

Mitt Romney (R-UT), who voted in favor of one of the articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump.

While discussing Trump administration National Security Adviser John Bolton, co-host Meghan McCain said, “He was asked about Zelensky, and instead of giving an answer to the students at Duke, he said, ‘You’ll love chapter 14,’ meaning, like, buy it. It’s like if you are giving a speech at a college, I think you should be candid and maybe talk about what you are so fearful you put in a book. But instead, he’s extremely self-promotional. He seems to want to be a celebrity in a way.”

Co-host Whoopi Goldberg said, “It’s freaky, ain’t it?”

McCain said, “I think there’s a certain amount of people in politics that just can’t let the spotlight go, and unfortunately— I used to really like him—Ambassador Bolton seems to fit in that box.”

Behar said, “The only patriot on the right, right now to me, is Romney. He’s the only one who stuck his neck out. The rest of them are trash.”

Clinton also added that she wants to “see Puerto Rican American citizens be able to vote for president.”

Clinton’s remarks were made after she was questioned about a report from Matt Drudge that claimed Bloomberg was considering asking Clinton to join his presidential ticket.

The Massachusetts senator, who has struggled to regain her footing and once-held top tier status, set her sights on her billionaire rival after it was revealed that he had successfully qualified for Wednesday’s Democrat primary debate and will, in fact, participate, despite his absence on the Nevada caucus ballot.

“It’s a shame Mike Bloomberg can buy his way into the debate,” Warren said on Tuesday. “But at least now primary voters curious about how each candidate will take on Donald Trump can get a live demonstration of how we each take on an egomaniac billionaire”:

This is far from the first time that Warren has taken aim at Bloomberg. She took shots at the billionaire in November following the beginning of his multimillion-dollar ad buy, which currently tops $400 million.

“Michael Bloomberg is making a bet about Democracy in 2020. He doesn’t need people. He only needs bags and bags of money,” she said.

I think this is fundamentally wrong,” Warren continued.

“It’s going to be about which billionaire can you stomach going forward. Because believe me, there are plenty of billionaires who think they should be president, or the minimum, should be picking the president,” she added:

173,Bloomberg Accused of Helping Communist China Suppress News,['John Hayward'],"Writing at the Intercept on Tuesday, Leta Hong Fincher described herself as “one of the many women Mike Bloomberg’s company tried to silence through nondisclosure agreements,” even though she never actually worked for Bloomberg’s companies.

Her husband did, however, and according to Fincher, Bloomberg brought enormous pressure to bear against the couple to suppress news reports that were embarrassing to Communist China.

Fincher said she was studying sociology at Tsinghua University in Beijing when her husband Michael Forsythe worked on a series of Bloomberg News reports about the tremendous wealth accumulated by Chinese leaders and their families, including the relatives of dictator Xi Jinping.

Like other visiting Western reporters critical of the Communist government, Forsythe soon found himself receiving death threats that included threats against Fincher and the couple’s two young children. Fincher said Bloomberg News told them not to say anything about the death threats pending an internal investigation, but after several months she broke her silence and mentioned them on Twitter.

Within a matter of hours, Fincher said her husband was contacted by a Bloomberg manager and told to “get your wife to delete her tweets.” She refused to do so, although she also stopped talking about the threats, fearful of antagonizing the company while she and Forsythe were dependent on his job with them.

It was another story in late 2013 that led to the couple’s most serious trouble with Bloomberg News, and eventually cost Forsythe his job. The story, reportedly fully backed by Forsythe’s editors until the last minute, once again concerned the secret finances of Xi and other top Chinese officials:

A Bloomberg managing editor, Jonathan Kaufman, said in an email in late September 2013, “I am in awe of the way you tracked down and deciphered the financial holdings and the players. … It’s a real revelation. Looking forward to pushing it up the line,” according to an account published by the Financial Times. Then Bloomberg killed the story at the last minute, and the company fired my husband in November after comments by Bloomberg News editor-in-chief Matt Winkler were leaked. “If we run the story, we’ll be kicked out of China,” Winkler reportedly said on a company call.

Fincher accused Mike Bloomberg of lying to the American people about his willingness to bend to Communist Party pressure to protect his business interests in China:

Mike Bloomberg, then New York City mayor and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, was asked on November 12, 2013, about reports that his company had self-censored out of fear of offending the Chinese government and he dismissed the question. “Nobody thinks that we’re wusses and not willing to stand up and write stories that are of interest to the public and that are factually correct,” Bloomberg told a press conference. Yet, days after Bloomberg made those comments to reporters in New York, Bloomberg lawyers in Hong Kong threatened to devastate my family financially by forcing us to repay the company for our relocation fees to Hong Kong from Beijing and the advance on my husband’s salary that we took out, leave us with no health insurance or income, and take me to court if I did not sign a nondisclosure agreement — even though I had never been a Bloomberg employee.

Fincher detailed a long legal battle following that threat, marked by repeated threats from the Bloomberg legal team to inflict ruinous financial damage upon her family. She eventually hired Edward Snowden’s legal team in Hong Kong, and they managed to get the Bloomberg team to back down from its demands for a gag order in 2014.

Fincher denounced Bloomberg not just for bowing to Communist China, but for using non-disclosure agreements to conceal “an environment of sexism” at the company:

Bloomberg managers and lawyers treated me as though I were a piece of company property, an appendage of my husband, using intimidation and threats to try to bully me into submission. I agonized over whether to sign the NDA and I remember feeling physically suffocated, as though my mouth were stuffed with cotton balls. I haven’t met any of the other women, but I imagine that they, too, may have experienced the same terror of being threatened by a multibillion-dollar corporation, which could ruin their lives if they did not comply. Even now, I am nervous about the consequences of speaking out. But the more of us speak out, the stronger we are.

As for her husband Michael Forsythe, he went to work for the New York Times after he was fired by Bloomberg News, and was able to publish the story spiked by Bloomberg in 2015.

174,Cernovich: Bloomberg Says What Media Accuse Trump Supporters of Saying,['Robert Kraychik'],"Michael Bloomberg has said things that left-wing news media outlets falsely accuse President Donald Trump’s supporters of having said, stated author and filmmaker Mike Cernovich on Tuesday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow.

Marlow observed Bloomberg’s authoritarian politics.

“How could you complain about our democracy and then have a guy who’s so openly authoritarian?” asked Marlow of news media characterizations of Trump as an aspiring dictator. “Every time Bloomberg opens his mouth, it seems like an authoritarian thought comes out of it. … This is a guy who harbors all these authoritarian fantasies and he clearly condescends to black and brown people. … You couldn’t say this stuff and keep a social media account. He could be president.”

Bloomberg has said “everything that the media pretends Trump supporters say,” replied Cernovich, adding, “and the response of the press has largely been, ‘Ah, who cares?'”

LISTEN:

“I think most people who hear about Mike Bloomberg will do so by one of his ads,” assessed Cernovich, commenting on broad news media disinterest in critical reporting of Bloomberg over the former New York City mayor’s comments about stop-and-frisk policies and minorities.

Marlow addressed public distrust of news media. “The establishment media now has such little power because everyone is learning that they’re just the boy who cried wolf to the extreme,” he said. “If everything is a crisis, nothing is crisis. If everything is an existential threat than nothing’s an existential threat. … We know that so often they announce something is going to be the end of everything and then it turns out to be a total zero, and no heads roll, no one is moved out of their prime time anchor slot.”

Left-wing news media outlets are now beholden to reflexive politics among their consumers, concluded Cernovich. “If I’m at the New York Times or a left-wing outlet, I realize that [my] audience has just gone full-cuckoo bird, and [I] just have to pander to them. It’s just, ‘Oh yeah, Trump’s bad. Orange man bad. NASCAR bad,’ and give them what they want to keep that subscriber revenue coming in.”

In response to Bloomberg’s consideration of Hillary Clinton as a running mate, Cernovich said, “I always thought Bloomberg would pick Stacy Abrams, and I still think that,” describing Stacy Abrams as “a much better play for Bloomberg.”

“It used to be that a billion dollars was a massive amount of money for a campaign,” Cernovich observed, “and it is, Bloomberg could spend on his own campaign ten billion and not even really notice it that much. I think it’s just interesting to think about what could somebody do with ten billion dollars. As of now, he’s spent [almost] 400 million in advertising. I didn’t really know who he was or really care that much, and everybody has to pay attention to him, now.”

Bloomberg has already spent over $300 million on advertising across TV, radio, and digital platforms, according to a report from CNBC. President Donald Trump’s total spending across his 2016 campaign, including outside groups, was below $450 million.

Cernovich added, “It is undeniable that [Michael Bloomberg] would be an oligarch, and his wealth, by the way, it’s so much that — even when you think about it — it’s hard to understand. For him, a million dollars is less than a dollar to the average person. If you’re a person making, say, 50 or 60 thousand dollars a year, the way you look at a dollar is the way Bloomberg looks at millions of dollars.

“He’s printing billions of dollars just in interest alone,” Cernovich remarked. “Bloomberg Financial does at least 10 billion dollars a year in revenue … [and] his margins are high. This guy is wealthy in a way we’ve never seen in American electoral politics.”

Cernovich stated, “The narrative ten years ago was, ‘Money in politics is awful.’ And in 2015, the narrative switched to, ‘Oh wow, look how much Hillary Clinton has raised.’ It just changed. So now the narrative is, ‘Raising money is cool.’ … Bloomberg is like a Jeff Bezos-level billionaire.”

The research reveals that even in low-migration states, the cost to American taxpayers is still significant. Of the total 415,000 foreign-born residents living in these ten states, about 88,000 are illegal aliens — indicating that illegal aliens represent more than 20 percent of foreign-born residents.

Those 88,000 illegal aliens across these ten states, along with about 35,000 of their U.S.-born children, are costing American taxpayers about $454 million every year, with each illegal alien costing anywhere between $4,000 and $6,000.

“To put that figure into context, that $454 million expenditure is more than 200 times what the state of Montana budgets for its entire Veterans Affairs program and it is 2.5 times the total sum that West Virginia invests in its state university,” the FAIR study notes.

FAIR researchers say the $4,000 to $6,000 cost of each illegal alien in these low-migration states means that social programs for American veterans, disabled Americans, and U.S. citizen children could be receiving “significantly more funding” if not for the statewide cost of providing these same services to illegal aliens.

The cost to taxpayers for the U.S.-born children of illegal aliens, commonly referred to as “anchor babies,” is particularly burdening on small towns’ school systems in low-migration states like Maine.

In Lewiston, Maine, for example, the school system has been forced to absorb an enormous population of either migrant children or the non-English speaking U.S.-born children of illegal aliens, who need English as a Second Language (ESL) lessons:

Over the past 15 years, more than 7,500 migrants – most of whom are refugees from dozens of different countries – have resettled in the town, which has a population of less than 40,000. As is often the case, residents and city officials had no say in the resettlement process and little warning that these migrants were going to be placed in their community. According to former Mayor Laurier T. Raymond Jr., the city became “maxed-out financially, physically, and emotionally.” [Emphasis added] The public school system in Lewiston crumbled as a result. In 2004, roughly 95 percent of all students were considered “proficient” in the English language. But by 2017, nearly 30 percent of the students were designated as Limited English Proficiency — three times more than the national average. And teachers have been forced to find a way to instruct a student body that speaks 34 different languages. In order to adequately educate the growing number of migrants moving to the state, Maine will need to increase its number of LEP-qualified teachers by as much as 110 percent. [Emphasis added]

Another example, reported by Breitbart News last year, is the small town of Worthington, Minnesota, which has been forced to absorb a steady flow of migrant children who arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border alone.

Taxpayers of Worthington voted to hike taxes in order to increase funding for their local school system due to the influx of mass immigration that has led to larger class sizes and teachers sometimes using old storage closets as classrooms.

As Breitbart News previously reported, illegal alien births to their U.S.-born children cost American taxpayers nationwide about $2.4 billion every year. Roughly one-in-four births that are paid for by taxpayers are those to an immigrant, legal or illegal. This accounts for 429,000 immigrant births every year that taxpayers subsidize. Illegal aliens births of anchor babies make up 11 percent — or about 198,000 births — of all births that are paid for by American taxpayers.

In 2019, there were nearly 400,000 illegal alien, tourist, and temporary worker births to U.S.-born children. The birthright citizenship policy ensures that all of these children are provided immediate American citizenship, which can be later used to sponsor their foreign relatives for an unlimited number of green cards.

Today, there are at least 4.5 million anchor babies in the U.S. under 18-years-old, exceeding the annual roughly four million American babies born every year. Likewise, there are 11 to 22 million illegal aliens living in the U.S., costing taxpayers at least $132 billion every year.

176,"Bernie Sanders Says Mike Bloomberg Stands for ‘Oligarchy, Not Democracy’",['Joel B. Pollak'],"RENO, Nevada — Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) attacked billionaire oligarch Mike Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, directly in an address at the University of Reno, Nevada on Tuesday morning.

Sanders took direct aim at Bloomberg, saying that “we have a corrupt political system which allows billionaires to buy elections.” The crowd booed.

“People who have enormous amounts of money can make incredible contributions. They can contribute hundreds of millions of dollars into the political process to elect candidates who represent the rich and the powerful,” he continued.

“And in [some] cases, they can even run for office themselves!”

He continued: “Anybody here worth 60 billion dollars? You can run for president, and you can buy the airwaves.” The crowd booed again.

“My friends, that is called oligarchy, not democracy.”

Bloomberg is currently running second or third behind Sanders in the latest national polls, and will appear with Sanders onstage at the Democrat debate on Wednesday evening in Las Vegas.

Sanders spoke to roughly 200 people in a hall on campus. Supporters came from the local community and from neighboring states.

Becca, from Nevada City, California, told Breitbart News that she supports Sanders because of “consistency over time, seeing someone who has a vision and following it over time.”

“Integrity,” chimed in her friend, Bethany, also from Nevada City.

A local Sanders precinct captain, Laurel, confided that she would vote for Bernie but would also consider alternatives.

She was nervous, she said, about whether Sanders could win the general election.

“We need to get ’45; and fascism out of the White House,” she said.

“I’m a former philosophy instructor, so truth is important to me,” she explained, adding that the country needed an alternative to what she saw as Trump’s climate of “fear” and “ignorance.”

Asked whom she might be considering as an alternative, she said Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN).

“She has a lot of the same positive energy, but would actually speak to the middle in ways [Sanders] will not,” she said.

Part of problem, Laurel said, was the “socialism piece — even just calling himself that.”

Her 9-year-old son, however, who was attending his first political event, had no doubt that Sanders was the strongest Democratic candidate to defeat Trump.

After his speech, Sanders led supporters on a march to a polling place at the university’s student union, where the last day of early voting was being held.

The actual caucuses will be held at noon on Saturday, Feb. 22

The debate will be held at the Paris Theater in Las Vegas at 6:00 p.m. PT / 9:00 p.m. ET, and will be hosted by MSNBC.

177,Exclusive–Tom Cotton on Coronavirus: Establishment Media ‘Spouting’ Chinese ‘Communist Party Line’,['Matthew Boyle'],"Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) ripped establishment U.S. media outlets who have mischaracterized his comments on the origins of the coronavirus outbreak plaguing China and the world during an exclusive interview with Breitbart News this week.

Cotton, who this past weekend during an appearance on Maria Bartiromo’s Fox News Channel program Sunday Morning Futures laid out how Communist China has not been honest about the origins of the coronavirus, has been the subject of vicious attacks from establishment media in the U.S. as a result.

In particular, during the Bartiromo interview, Cotton specifically said there is not evidence to suggest that the coronavirus originated in a high-security biochemical lab the Chinese Communist Party government operates in Wuhan. But since the government’s original official story about the virus’s origin is collapsing under scrutiny, the senator argued that the question needs to be asked—and that that theory, along with several other more plausible virus origin theories than the Communists’ original and likely false claim that the virus originated in a food market, need to be pursued. Cotton argued that the Communists must allow internationally renowned independent western experts into China to investigate the matter.

“We don’t have evidence that this disease originated there but because of China’s duplicity and dishonesty from the beginning, we need to at least ask the question to see what the evidence says, and China right now is not giving evidence on that question at all,” Cotton said in the Bartiromo interview.

WATCH THE FULL COTTON INTERVIEW WITH BARTIROMO:

Cotton has been aggressive in his criticism of Communist China on coronavirus, as he was in the Fox News interview and in this exclusive interview with Breitbart News. He was also the first U.S. senator to call for President Donald Trump’s administration to extend a temporary travel ban to China in order to protect Americans from the disease—which he did in another Breitbart News exclusive a few weeks ago.

In his interview with Breitbart News on Monday, Cotton—who is also launching a new effort to back conservative Republican veterans for Congress—called on China to allow western experts into Wuhan province in China to investigate coronavirus and its origins.

“Of course the Chinese Communist Party needs to be open and transparent, and they have not been from the beginning as they still refuse to be,” Cotton said. “Just in the past couple days, they released a so-called secret speech from Chairman Xi that he supposedly gave in early January to demonstrate how on top of matters he was blaming the local officials—an endemic problem to communist government. It was like a parody of historical revisionism, like old-school Marxist Leninists. What the Chinese Communist Party needs to do is open up to internationally recognized experts—not Iranian experts or even Russian ones, but European and American and Canadian and Japanese—where there’s no question of their credentials or their integrity and allow them into Wuhan, allow them into the food market, and allow them into the super laboratory in Wuhan so they can figure out exactly where this virus came from and we can glean lessons from that to develop effective diagnostic testing and vaccines.”

But perhaps more importantly than that, Cotton laid out how the establishment media—much of which has accused him of spreading conspiracy theories about the coronavirus—is “spouting” Chinese Communist Party propaganda.

“The second point you make though is about the media, and this is yet again a gross form of mainstream media bias—they are spouting the party line, and in this case it is the Communist Party line,” Cotton told Breitbart News. “They are doing everything they can to be apologists for the Chinese Communist Party when in fact it is in the Communist Party system of government that has inflicted this outbreak upon the world—and most importantly upon their own people. The Chinese people, after all, are the first and worst victims of the Communist Party government in China. It’s time the media start directing these questions not at skeptics in Washington, but begin directing their skepticism towards Chinese apparatchiks in Beijing.”

For instance, after the Fox News interview with Bartiromo, the Washington Post’s Paulina Firozi wrote a piece that in the headline says Cotton “keeps repeating a coronavirus conspiracy theory that was already debunked.”

The Post piece, however, just quotes a few experts disagreeing with Cotton on his questioning of the matter and does not even address the Communist Party of China’s likely false claims that the virus originated in a food market. In response to that story, Cotton sent out a tweet-storm further explaining his questions about the virus origins:

Let me debunk the debunkers. @paulina_milla and her “experts” wrongly jump straight to the claim that the coronavirus is an engineered bioweapon. That’s not what I’ve said. There’s at least four hypotheses about the origin of the virus: https://t.co/536ygN1gC7 — Tom Cotton (@SenTomCotton) February 17, 2020

1. Natural (still the most likely, but almost certainly not from the Wuhan food market) — Tom Cotton (@SenTomCotton) February 17, 2020

2. Good science, bad safety (eg, they were researching things like diagnostic testing and vaccines, but an accidental breach occurred) — Tom Cotton (@SenTomCotton) February 17, 2020

3. Bad science, bad safety (this is the engineered-bioweapon hypothesis, with an accidental breach) — Tom Cotton (@SenTomCotton) February 17, 2020

4. Deliberate release (very unlikely, but shouldn’t rule out till the evidence is in) — Tom Cotton (@SenTomCotton) February 17, 2020

Again, none of these are “theories” and certainly not “conspiracy theories.” They are hypotheses that ought to be studied in light of the evidence, if the Chinese Communist Party would provide it. — Tom Cotton (@SenTomCotton) February 17, 2020

We ought to be transparent with the American people about all this. Maybe some of these so-called experts think they know better. I don’t. And they really don’t either. — Tom Cotton (@SenTomCotton) February 17, 2020

But, then, the New York Times published its own piece claiming that Cotton was repeating a “fringe theory” about the “origin” of coronavirus. In it, the newspaper takes the Communists in China at their word about the origins of the virus—not questioning the false claims it originated in a food market. “The Chinese authorities say the outbreak began in a market in Wuhan where wild animals were sold,” the New York Times’ Alexandra Stevenson wrote.

Throughout the article, Stevenson repeatedly frames Cotton’s questioning of the Communist government in Beijing using words and phrases like “rumor” or “conspiracy theory” or “lacks evidence” or “has been dismissed by scientists” to describe what the senator was saying—while offering no such criticism whatsoever of the Communist Party line.

Cotton hit back at Stevenson in a separate tweet:

If @jotted took the time to actually listen to what I’ve said, she wouldn’t embarrass herself so badly. Instead, she spouts the party line—the Communist Party line. https://t.co/2vu7B4JQPy — Tom Cotton (@SenTomCotton) February 17, 2020

In his Breitbart News exclusive interview this week, the senator made clear though that it is unsurprising to see establishment U.S. media outlets like the Washington Post and New York Times—among the many others attacking him this week—defending the Communist Party.

“For years and years and years, China has engaged in a concerted effort to court western media,” Cotton told Breitbart News. “China has been paying millions of dollars to the New York Times and Washington Post to run their propaganda sections. And of course, there’s always the romance between left-wing reporters and left-wing government, of which communism is the best example, so there’s a lot of reasons why the media reflexively defends China, but they have to stop it and they have to hold Beijing to account for the good of the entire world.”",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/18/exclusive-tom-cotton-on-coronavirus-establishment-media-spouting-chinese-communist-party-line/
178,Wuhan Hospital Director Dies from Coronavirus,['John Hayward'],"Dr. Liu Zhiming, a neurologist and director of Wuchang Hospital in the troubled city of Wuhan, China, was reportedly killed by the coronavirus on Tuesday.

Liu is the highest-ranking Chinese medical official to be killed by the virus so far. At least six other health care workers have died from the disease and over 1,700 have taken ill.

Liu was 51 years old and in good health, so he joins the late whistleblower Dr. Li Wenliang as evidence the coronavirus does not kill only the elderly and those with severe pre-existing conditions. Li Wenliang was only 34 years old when the virus killed him two weeks ago.

As with Dr. Li, the Chinese Communist Party scrambled to control the political fallout from Dr. Liu’s death, delaying public acknowledgment, leading to what the Epoch Times described as “confusion” about Liu’s condition:

The director and party secretary of the publicity center within the Health Commission of Hubei first reported that Liu had died around 10:00 p.m. local time on Feb. 17 through Weibo, a popular Twitter-like Chinese social media platform. In the post, which was subsequently deleted, he described Liu as the first hospital director to have “sacrificed” his life to fight the virus and expressed “profound condolences.” […] Confusion arose just hours after the party secretary’s Weibo post after Liu’s wife reportedly told Pear Video, a leading Chinese short video platform, that he was in critical condition and was relying on an ECMO machine (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) to support his breathing. She added that his illness had lingered for over 20 days. Liu was transferred to Wuhan Tongji Hospital on Feb. 14 and has been under intubation since, she said. The voice in the video was electronically altered. The Epoch Times is unable to independently verify the video’s authenticity. A staff member from the hospital confirmed that “he was being treated,” but did not provide more information. Another hospital employee said they were not aware of the issue beyond the online discussions. China Daily and several other state run media had also run reports on Liu death, but subsequently deleted their articles and social media posts, in a fashion reminiscent of the death of Wuhan doctor and whistleblower Li Wenliang less than two weeks ago.

Once this “confusion” was resolved, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission announced that Liu “passed away at 10:54 Tuesday morning at the age of 51 after all-out efforts to save him failed.”

“From the start of the outbreak, Comrade Liu Zhiming, without regard to his personal safety, led the medical staff of Wuchang Hospital at the front lines of the fight against the epidemic,” the commission said, crediting Liu with making “significant contributions” to Wuhan’s fight against the disease.

Wuchang Hospital is one of seven major facilities designated for the treatment of coronavirus patients in Wuhan. Dr. Liu was a leading neurologist at the hospital.",https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/02/18/wuhan-hospital-director-dies-from-coronavirus/
179,Hong Kong Citizens Protest Plans for Coronavirus Centers,['John Hayward'],"Hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets of Hong Kong over the weekend to protest plans for establishing 18 treatment centers for the Wuhan coronavirus in residential neighborhoods.

Some of the demonstrations escalated into clashes with the police after participants tried to block off roads and vandalize clinics.

The Hong Kong Free Press (HKFP) reported several district officials participated in the demonstrations, and at least two of them were pepper-sprayed by the police.

Opposition legislator Claudia Mo suggested Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam should consider using “more desirable sites” for treating coronavirus patients, such as Chinese military barracks:

When asked if lawmakers or district councillors were told about the clinic plans, she said: “None… [Chief Executive] Carrie Lam behaves like a tinpot dictator and obviously thinks she can do just anything she wants… the residents should at least be consulted over the designated clinic plan.” “Carrie Lam starts the fire on one hand, and pretends to try to have it put out on the other. Hongkongers caught in the middle are getting burnt.” Mo added. Meanwhile, District Councillor Mak Tsz-kin told HKFP that he was stopped and searched by a police officer at a Fo Tan protest before the assembly began: “He asked me questions with a very unfriendly attitude,” he said. He also questioned if water cannon trucks deployed at Shan Mei Street were necessary. Mak said that chances of community outbreak in the neighbourhood were a concern: “We have no confidence in this government. Incidents of home-quarantined patients escaping are not unheard of. How do they ensure that there will be enough manpower to monitor the situation?”

Several quarantine centers are already up and running in Hong Kong residential areas and are approaching their maximum capacity. Hong Kong has reported 62 cases of the virus so far, with one fatality.

The South China Morning Post on Tuesday cited research from Chinese University that found isolation for Hong Kong coronavirus patients has been delayed by an average of six and a half days, with an average of three visits to the doctor before quarantine was ordered, giving the virus more of an opportunity to spread. There have been 43 cases of local infection so far, 12 of them from completely unknown sources.

The researchers also argued that Hong Kongers are not practicing enough defensive “social distancing measures,” although over 98 percent of them are wearing masks in public areas.",https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/02/18/hundreds-hong-kong-protest-plans-coronavirus-centers-residential-areas/
180,"Klobuchar on the Struggle Bus: Campaign Disorganized, Scrambling Ahead of Nevada Caucuses",['Hannah Bleau'],"Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) is having trouble channeling the momentum from her third-place finish in New Hampshire into Nevada as her campaign descends into disorganization — with her campaign “scrambling” to fill key positions and instructing staffers to drive her campaign bus thousands of miles across the country due to her lack of a campaign bus in the Silver State — just days ahead of the caucuses, according to reports.

While Klobuchar considered her strong third-place finish in New Hampshire a victory, it was short-lived as all eyes turned to the Nevada caucuses. Klobuchar’s presence in the state has not been as strong as some of her rivals, and her campaign is reportedly struggling to adjust accordingly.

According to the Washington Post, Klobuchar is “scrambling to hire for basic jobs that other campaigns filled months ago, including a Nevada operations director.” She has resorted to using her Iowa specialist to help her strategize ahead of the Nevada caucuses due to her lack of a Nevada caucus specialist, and she “had no campaign bus in Nevada, so staffers had to drive the one in New Hampshire 2,700 miles to get there”:

New WaPo reporting on Amy Klobuchar’s campaign in Nevada: – Scrambling to hire for jobs other campaigns filled months ago

– Had to drive NH bus 2,700 miles because she had no Nevada bus

– Lacked Nevada caucus expert so she is using her Iowa caucus experthttps://t.co/DB1Lsth2W4 — JM Rieger (@RiegerReport) February 18, 2020

“We’re putting the airplane together as we’re flying it,” one adviser told the Washington Post.

The problems extend far behind Nevada, the Post adds. A poor showing in Nevada could quash all momentum that followed the New Hampshire primary and compromise her performance in South Carolina. If she fails to show up in either state, her ability to adequately compete in Super Tuesday states could be greatly, if not all, diminished.

The Post specifically notes Klobuchar’s disconnect among black voters — a key demographic in South Carolina and one Joe Biden (D) is resting his dwindling presidential aspirations on:

She struggles especially to connect with African American voters, and black activists say she has made little effort. The campaign in recent days had to ask a former Democratic official for a list of black churches in South Carolina, which votes a week after Saturday’s Nevada caucuses. “Where’s Amy?” Roland Martin, a prominent black political analyst, posted on his Instagram account recently. “If she wants black votes, she has to talk to black people.”

However, Klobuchar’s staffers are reportedly strategizing on how to effectively compete in upcoming states, questioning if it is worth investing resources in states like Texas and California:

Some advisers want her to focus instead on independent-minded states that aren’t overly liberal, like Maine and Tennessee, because they might be receptive to her centrist message. But those states, of course, yield much fewer delegates.

“From the beginning of this campaign, she has been understaffed and under-resourced compared to the other leading candidates,” Klobuchar adviser Norm Sterzenbach said, according to the Post.

“So the strategy is always going to be to find moments that she can capitalize on to build momentum that leads into the next piece and the next piece. So it’s going to be, for a little while, step by step for her,” he added.

As Sterzenbach suggested, the presidential hopeful’s campaign has tried to capitalize on significant moments. It recently celebrated a fundraising milestone, raising over $12 million following the New Hampshire debate.

“We’re building up our staff all over the country, actually in the Super Tuesday states, because finally, I’ve gotten the resources I need, over $12 million just in the little over a week since the New Hampshire debate,” Klobuchar said during an appearance on CBS’s Face the Nation.

Indeed, Klobuchar has seen an uptick in endorsements, particularly from key newspapers like the Las Vegas Weekly, which praised the Minnesota senator as a “sincere and results-oriented leader,” and the Houston Chronicle, which proclaimed that she possessed the “secret sauce” to win.

She has since been working to juice up her funds, attending a high-dollar fundraiser in the Beverly Hills home of Jaws star Lorraine Sheinberg. Tickets reportedly went for $500.

She is also making efforts in the Palmetto State, launching a six-figure ad blitz ahead of the state’s upcoming primary.

Klobuchar will have another chance to experience a breakout moment during Wednesday’s Democrat debate in Las Vegas. She will appear alongside rivals Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Pete Buttigieg (D), and Michael Bloomberg (D).

Nonetheless, the RealClearPolitics average spells trouble for Klobuchar, who is sitting in sixth place with 5.8 percent support nationally.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/18/amy-klobuchar-on-the-struggle-bus-campaign-disorganized-scrambling-ahead-of-nevada-caucuses/
181,Bernie Sanders Compares Voting for Him to Voting for Nelson Mandela,['Joel B. Pollak'],"RENO, Nevada — Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) compared himself to the late South African President Nelson Mandela in an address to supporters at the University of Nevada, Reno, on Tuesday morning.

“You know, I think back now, and I think, in fact, some of you may be familiar with Nelson Mandela — remember that, and his fight for freedom in South Africa? — and people marching to the polls,” Sanders said, as he closed his remarks, before an audience of about 200 people.

“I’m thinking about the civil rights movement, and people marching to the polls. Well, we’re fighting to change America.”

Sanders then led supporters on a walk to the nearby student union, which is a polling place ,to encourage them to cast their votes on the last day of early voting for the Feb. 22 Nevada caucuses.

The Vermont senator is currently the frontrunner in the race for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, leading in national polls and in Nevada after winning the most votes in Iowa and New Hampshire earlier this month.

Many supporters share Sanders’s nostalgia for earlier idealistic struggles — or simply the counterculture of that period.

One woman came to the event wearing Bernie Sanders-themed attire in the style of the Grateful Dead:

Sanders will face off against the rest of the Democratic presidential frontrunners — including a newcomer former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg — in the Democrat debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday night at 9 p.m. ET on MSNBC.

184,Austin Businesses Sound Alarm over Homelessness Hitting ‘Boiling Point’,['Amy Furr'],"The homelessness problem is getting out of hand and increasing the risk of danger, a steakhouse owner in Austin, Texas, said recently.

“Our biggest thing is this isn’t safe for anybody, and that includes the homeless population,” Vince Young Steakhouse’s Executive Chef Phillip Brown told KXAN.

On Twitter Wednesday, Brown shared photos he took of a large cardboard box behind his restaurant where people had set up camp:

@MayorAdler @austintexasgov This is not where people should be camping – this is the alleyway of our business. Not only is this VERY unsafe for our guests, patrons and staff, this is not a safe space to camp out! Something must change! @ToddAndDonKLBJ pic.twitter.com/ezg6DvWTtL — VinceYoungSteakhouse (@vysteakhouse) February 13, 2020

While there are now more police in the area, Brown said, “They can’t be everywhere all the time.”

On January 25, Austin police arrested a homeless woman who reportedly confessed to stabbing five women in the famous Sixth Street area of the city, according to Breitbart News.

Austin police Chief Brian Manley said when an officer approached one of the women, she was “lying on the ground in a pool of blood.”

“The witnesses described seeing the suspect, after passing their group take a swing, hitting at the victim, hitting the victim and the victim falling to the ground,” he stated.

For Brown, problems regarding the homeless issue escalated a year and a half ago when an alleged homeless man began knocking tables over on the restaurant’s patio, then hit him in the head.

At the hospital, the chef received 13 stitches.

However, Mayor Steve Adler told KXAN Monday that Austin is one of the safest big cities in America and said people should not automatically link the homeless to violent crimes.

“We have a challenge. We’re attacking it, not hiding it,” he commented.

In November, Craig Staley, co-owner of Royal Blue Grocery, said the homeless population grew somewhat empowered after the city council voted to weaken ordinances regarding panhandling, lying on sidewalks, and camping in certain public areas.

Staley noted that his employees were being confronted more often and shoplifting had also increased.

“When we first opened our store last decade, if you had trouble with someone that was homeless, you’d say, ‘You can’t sit there,’ and they’d say, ‘Okay, sorry.’ And now it’s, ‘Screw you.’ They changed the world downtown in about three weeks,” he said.

Brown knows the problems will not be fixed overnight but explained that he has become weary of dealing with them on such a frequent basis.

185,WATCH: Police Drone Leads Officers to Blind Man Lost in Woods,['Amy Furr'],"A blind man was located by a law enforcement drone after he became lost in a wooded area for nearly 33 hours in Enfield, Connecticut, on Saturday.

Friday, 62-year-old Richard Doty’s brother called the Enfield Police Department for help when he did not hear from him and became concerned about his safety, according to CNN.

“Enfield PD Officers responded to take the initial report and through investigation and knowledge of the victims past behavior determined that it was likely that he walked away from the home and became disoriented,” the department wrote on Facebook.

The post continued:

Through interviewing neighbors, Officers determined that the male party had not been seen since approximately 10 AM on 2/14/20, approximately 24 hours prior. Due to the temperature, there was concern about hypothermia and it was clear that time was of the essence for a successful outcome. Vernon CT Police Department was contacted for assistance and a drone pilot from Vernon PD responded from home to assist.

For approximately 30 minutes, authorities searched the area using the drone and were finally able to locate Doty lying at the bottom of an embankment 100 yards into the woods.

“The male party stated to personnel that he had become disoriented due to medical conditions and had been outside for approximately 33 hours, surviving overnight in temperatures around 9 degrees Fahrenheit,” the department said.

Following the rescue, Doty was taken to St. Francis Hospital in Hartford for treatment. There is currently no word on his condition.

“By covering large areas in a short period of time, a drone can help save a life by locating a person much more quickly than could be accomplished on foot, so that they can get the medical care they need,” according to UAVCoach.com.

Saturday, Lt. Bryan Nolan said police departments are using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) now more than ever to perform their duties.

“It is becoming more common for us to use drones,” he concluded.",https://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/02/18/watch-police-drone-leads-officers-blind-man-lost-woods/
186,Security Experts: Google Allowed 500 Malicious Apps onto Its Web Store,['Lucas Nolan'],"Google has reportedly pulled over 500 malicious Chrome extensions from its Web Store, with some active on the site for over a year. The extensions used the computers of millions of people to commit ad fraud and steal data.

A recent report by Naked Security from Sophos reveals that tech giant Google has pulled over 500 Chrome extensions from its Web Store after researchers discovered that many were stealing browser data and executing click fraud on the computers of millions of users.

Although Google claims to protect its users from fraud and malicious apps, the report makes the startling assertion that many of the illicit apps were made available by Google for up to a year, with some made available to Chrome users for even longer.

Security researcher Jamila Kaya used Duo Security’s CRXcavator tool to spot a handful of extensions that were suspicious. Kaya then connected the extensions to each other in order to identify recurring patterns that could highlight other infected extensions.

Naked Security writes:

The first giveaway was that the extension code often looked like copycats of one another despite small changes to the names of internal functions designed to obscure this.

Another troubling similarity was the number of permissions requested. Enough to allow them to access browsing data and run when visiting websites using HTTPS. Working with Duo Security, they eventually identified 70 extensions that seemed to be related to one another. All also contacted similar command and control networks and seemed to have been designed to detect and counteract sandbox analysis. Ad fraud was the biggest activity – contacting domains without the user being aware – as well as redirecting users to malware and phishing domains. Naked Security notes that many of the extensions had been active for nearly a year with some possibly being around for longer. Google carried out its own investigation and found that over 500 extensions were infected.

Naked Security suggests that users take the following actions to prevent their browsers from becoming infected.

Install as few extensions as possible and, despite the above, only from official web stores.

Check the reviews and feedback from others who have installed the extension.

Pay attention to the developer’s reputation and how responsive they are to questions and how frequently they post version updates.

Study the permissions they ask for (in Chrome, Settings> Extensions> Details) and check they’re in line with the features of the extension. And if these permissions change, be suspicious.

Reclaim the Net reports that the account of WikiLeaks was locked according to WikiLeaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson. Hrafnsson noted via his personal account that the WikiLeaks account was locked “shortly before Assange extradition hearing.” Hrafnsson’s tweet can be seen below:

188,Abrams Defends Bloomberg After She Receives $5M for PAC in December,['Charlie Spiering'],"Failed Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams defended billionaire Michael Bloomberg on Monday for using his riches to compete in the Democrat presidential primary.

“Every person is allowed to run and should run the race that they think they should run, and Mike Bloomberg has chosen to use his finances,” Abrams said in an interview on ABC’s The View on Monday about Bloomberg.

Abrams compared Bloomberg using his billions to boost his campaign to other candidates using their natural talent or pets to run for office.

“Other people are using their dog, their charisma, their whatever,” she said. “I think it’s an appropriate question to raise. But I don’t think it’s disqualifying for anyone to invest in fixing America.”

According to Federal Election Commission (FEC) records, Abrams received a $5 million donation from Bloomberg in December 2019, to Fair Fight, her political action committee to fight voter suppression.

Abrams indicated it was comforting to know the source of Michael Bloomberg’s money, despite many Democrats complaining that the former New York City mayor was trying to buy the election.

“I think that for once we actually know where the money is coming from,” she said.

Abrams also walked back her March 2019 assertion that she was no longer interested in serving as a vice presidential candidate.

“It would be doing a disservice to every woman of color, every woman of ambition, every child who wants to think beyond their known space for me to say no or to pretend, ‘Oh, no, I don’t want it,’” she said in the interview. “Of course I want it. Of course, I want to serve America. Of course I want to be a patriot and do this work.”",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/18/stacey-abrams-defends-michael-bloomberg-after-she-receives-5-million-for-pac-in-december/
189,Mike Bloomberg Changed Rules to Run for Third Term in New York,['Joel B. Pollak'],"Billionaire oligarch Mike Bloomberg is running as the “anti-Trump,” casting President Donald Trump as a “bully.” “I bill myself as the un-Trump,” Bloomberg told a campaign rally last week.

But as mayor of New York City from 2002 to 2013, Bloomberg behaved like the authoritarian many Democrats believe Trump to be, changing the rules to allow himself to run for a third term, then voting to change them back.

As the Wall Street Journal noted toward the end of his three-term tenure:

Perhaps Mr. Bloomberg’s most controversial move was running for a third term in 2009 by engineering the repeal of a law passed twice by voter referendum limiting city elected officials to two terms. That decision colored his final years in office, as his approval ratings fell from the high 60s and never again cracked 50% in his third term, according to Marist. Voters reinstated term limits in 2010.

Bloomberg argued that only he could steer the city through the fallout of the global financial crisis in 2008. Almost half of New Yorkers disagreed: Bloomberg only won his third term by an unexpectedly narrow margin, barely reaching 51 percent, just five points ahead of his challenger.

Later, the Journal noted, Bloomberg voted in 2010 to reinstate a two-term limit, meaning that only he could enjoy a third term.

He called his third term “an extraordinary one-time thing.”

Bloomberg qualified Tuesday for Wednesday’s presidential debate in Las Vegas, Nevada, at the Paris Theater at 6:00 p.m. PT / 9:00 p.m. ET on MSNBC.

190,Buttigieg: Illegals Have ‘Every Bit of Claim on This Country’ As We Do,['Charlie Spiering'],"Former Mayor Pete Buttigieg repeated his claim Monday that the United States of America belonged to illegal immigrants, just as much the country’s citizens.

At a campaign rally in Utah, Buttigieg said that the so-called “dreamers,” illegal immigrants brought to the country as children, had “every bit a claim on this country as the rest of us.”

He continued in Spanish, which translated to English meant, “We should tell dreamers that we support them, and we understand that this country is your country too.”

Buttigieg has stepped up his use of Spanish and his political support for amnesty and taxpayer-funded health care for illegal immigrants as he tries to place well in the Nevada caucuses on Saturday.

Earlier Monday, Buttigieg told voters in Nevada that the legal immigration system was not allowing enough people into the country.

The people come, but then they are endangered of all of the uncertainties of being undocumented in this country.”",https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/02/18/pete-buttigieg-illegal-immigrants-have-every-bit-of-claim-on-this-country-as-the-rest-of-us/
191,"Indie Rock Band Helps Draw 17,000 for Bernie Sanders Rally in Tacoma, WA",['Hannah Bleau'],"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) drew a massive crowd of over 17,000 to his rally in Tacoma, Washington, Monday evening, which featured actor Tim Robbins, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), and the indie rock band Portugal. The Man.

His campaign is calling it “the largest rally any presidential candidate has held in Washington this cycle.”

“This is the kind of energy a campaign needs to defeat Donald Trump in November,” Bernie 2020 Washington State Director Carin Chase said in a statement.

“Our campaign has the grassroots support and momentum we need to expand the electorate here in Washington and complete the political revolution Bernie started in 2016,” Chase added.

Sanders held the rally at the Tacoma Dome, which has a capacity of up to 23,000. Portugal. The Man reportedly played “Children Of The Revolution” for the crowd ahead of Sanders’ appearance:

“Today we say to Mayor Bloomberg: we are a democracy, not an oligarchy, you’re not gonna buy this election,” he told the crowd.

“We say to Mr. Bloomberg, you are certainly not going to win when you have a record in New York City that included racist policies like stop and frisk,” he continued to boos, “which caused communities of color to live in fear and humiliation in New York City.”

He added:

You’re not going to win an election when you opposed raising the minimum wage. You know, people who have billions of dollars should not be opposed to raising the minimum wage above $7.25. You’re not going to win an election when you called for cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.

192,Pro-Life Leader Rips Michael Bloomberg’s Alleged Hostility Toward Pregnant Staff,['Dr. Susan Berry'],"The communications director of a UK pro-life organization said a 1997 lawsuit that alleged Michael Bloomberg told his pregnant employee to “kill it” in order to protect her career at his firm, is an example of the pressure to abort that pregnant women continually face in the workplace.

“Outrageous comments such as these can pressure women to have an abortion in order to protect their career,” said Michael Robinson, director of communications at the pro-life Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (SPUC). “These comments are not appropriate for any employer.”

According to allegations made in a 1997 lawsuit against the former New York City mayor, Bloomberg told employee Sekiko Sakai, a sales manager in his company, to “kill it” when she revealed her pregnancy.

“Great, No. 16′,” the current Democrat presidential candidate allegedly bemoaned, according to a 2001 New York Times article, in a reference to the 16 pregnant employees he had in his company at the time.

The lawsuit and its allegations resurfaced in December, along with others claiming a sexist environment at Bloomberg LP, after the billionaire businessman’s announcement of his candidacy for president.

ABC News ran a piece with the headline, “Bloomberg’s Sexist Remarks Fostered Company Culture that Degraded Women, Lawsuits Allege.”

As the Times reported in 2001, Bloomberg has denied the specific allegation that he told Sakai to “kill it,” citing a polygraph test.

According to ABC News, Bloomberg LP “settled Sakai’s case on undisclosed terms, and she is now bound by a confidentiality agreement.”

SPUC’s Robinson said Bloomberg’s alleged comments represent “a scenario in which such negative workplace attitudes towards pregnancy and motherhood make a woman feel she ought to have an abortion in order to protect her career.”

In 2007, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) brought a massive case against Bloomberg’s company, alleging discrimination against pregnant women and new mothers in the firm.

ABC News reported:

The lawsuit alleged that the company engaged in a pattern of discrimination against women after they became pregnant and after they took maternity leave. Sixty-seven women were prepared to join the case. The time period of the misconduct alleged in the lawsuit was between 2002 and 2007 while Bloomberg was mayor of New York City and not involved in the day-to-day operations of the company, although he remained the majority owner of it. A court dismissed the case in 2011.

A later 2016 lawsuit places the blame directly on Bloomberg for creating the hostile culture at his company.

“Mr. Bloomberg, Bloomberg’s founder, CEO, and President, and the former three-term Mayor of New York, encouraged this type of sexist and sexually charged behavior,” said the complaint, according to ABC News. The complainant was an anonymous 26-year-old female employee of the company.

“Bloomberg’s notoriously sexist and hostile work environment has been well documented and has been the subject of myriad law suits prior to this lawsuit,” the complaint continued.

“It is important that women in the workplace do not have their job security threatened because of pregnancy,” SPUC’s Robinson commented. “Negative workplace attitudes towards pregnancy and motherhood can put pregnant women in an extremely vulnerable position at a time when their focus should be on their wellbeing and that of their unborn child.”

Robinson stressed as well that discrimination against pregnant women in the workplace “is not a matter of isolated incidents, but is part of a growing hostility towards pregnancy and motherhood.”

Bloomberg is a staunch supporter of Planned Parenthood and abortion rights. Last week, he announced his plan “to expand and safeguard access to reproductive services.”

Women employees of Planned Parenthood have reported complaints similar to those of Bloomberg’s female staff.

In December 2018, the New York Times published a report that revealed employees of Planned Parenthood said the abortion giant mistreated and discriminated against pregnant women and new mothers in the workplace.

The report observed interviews and legal documents showed women employees of Planned Parenthood and other feminist organizations have “described discrimination that violated federal or state laws — managers considering pregnancy in hiring decisions, for example, or denying rest breaks recommended by a doctor.”

“Many women said they were afraid to announce a pregnancy at work, sensing they would be seen as abandoning their colleagues,” stated the Times, adding:

[A]t Planned Parenthood, the country’s leading provider of reproductive services, managers in some locations declined to hire pregnant job candidates, refused requests by expecting mothers to take breaks and in some cases pushed them out of their jobs after they gave birth, according to current and former employees in California, Texas, North Carolina and New York.

Former Planned Parenthood employees and union representatives say the discrimination exists against pregnant employees and new mothers, with some employees expressing a disdain by management toward pregnant staff.

According to the Times report, Planned Parenthood blamed its reported failure to provide paid maternity leave or appropriate workplace conditions for pregnant employees on continued threats of defunding by conservative lawmakers.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/18/pro-life-leader-rips-michael-bloombergs-alleged-hostility-toward-pregnant-staff/
193,Poll: Bernie Sanders Holds 19-Point Lead in Nevada,['Hannah Bleau'],"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is leading in Nevada with 19 percentage points over his closest rival, a Data For Progress poll released Monday revealed.

The survey, taken February 12-15, 2020 among 766 likely Nevada caucus-goers, showed Sanders with an overwhelmingly strong showing in the Silver State, with 35 percent support. His closest rival, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), comes 19 points behind with 16 percent support. Pete Buttigieg (D) and Joe Biden (D) follow closely behind with 15 percent and 14 percent, respectively. Tom Steyer (D) also garnered double-digit support, with 10 percent choosing the billionaire.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) saw nine percent support, and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard saw two percent. Michael Bloomberg (D) is not on the Nevada caucus ballot.

The margin of error is +/- 3.4 percent:

#Nevada Democratic Primary Polling: Sanders: 35%

Warren: 16%

Buttigieg: 15%

Klobuchar: 9%

Gabbard: 2% Data For Progress / February 15, 2020 / n=766 — Polling USA (@USA_Polling) February 17, 2020

The survey found Nevada Democrats “strongly support” Sanders’ key policy proposals, with 69 percent supporting Medicare for All and 93 percent supporting a Green New Deal.

It also found Sanders performs the best among Hispanic voters, which is largely driving his strong numbers.

According to the survey:

Sanders performs extremely well with Hispanic likely caucusgoers, registering 66 percent support, with no other candidate cracking double digits. … Bernie’s base of support is found both among voters under 45 and Hispanic voters. Among voters under 45, he holds a 50 point lead over Warren who sits in second place with 14 percent. Meanwhile, 66 percent of Hispanic likely caucusgoers back Sanders, with the rest of the field accounting for the remaining 34 percentage points.

Sanders’ popularity among Latino voters could grow further following a recent endorsement from the influential grassroots group Mijente, which describes itself as a “political home for multi-racial Latinx and Chicanx people”:

We need a president who will fight like hell for change that is long overdue & who will not quickly return to pre-Trump, quasi-progressive policies. With over 70% of the vote, a majority of Mijente members agree that Sanders is the best path to mobilize Latinxs & beat Trump. — Mijente 🐜🐜🐜 (@ConMijente) February 18, 2020

The group plans to mobilize voters for Sanders ahead of the Nevada caucuses and continue its efforts in other key states such as California, Texas, and Arizona.

194,Here's How the ‘Winner’ Will Be Declared in Nevada's Democrat Caucuses,['Michael Patrick Leahy'],"The Nevada State Democratic Party (NSDP) is hoping this Saturday’s Nevada Democrat caucuses will not turn into the same reporting debacle that marred the February 3 Iowa Democrat caucuses.

The NSDP hurriedly scrapped plans to use the technology app that failed so dramatically in Iowa.

Instead, the party will use a make shift reporting system. Recent reports indicate that party workers at the caucuses across the state have complained that they have not been trained properly on how to implement the new plan.

“It feels like the [state party is] making it up as they go along,” one aide to a presidential campaign told the Washington Post on condition of anonymity.

ABC reported on the details of the 2020 Nevada caucuses’ reporting system:

Among the key changes that the Nevada Democratic Party is implementing post-Iowa is a “caucus calculator,” which will assist precinct chairs “in completing caucus math as well as incorporate early vote data,” according to a new memo that details the updated caucus reporting process sent to the presidential campaigns early Thursday and obtained by ABC News. …

The caucus calculator will only be used on party-purchased iPads – not on personal devices as was the case for the app in Iowa – and will be accessed through “a secure Google web form.” The calculator will only be “provided” to and “pre-configured” for trained precinct chairs to determine viability and award delegates. . .

Their multi-step reporting process includes “a two-source verification process where data will first be reported” through “a secure hotline to a trained operator” and one other additional source, either the calculator or the reporting sheet. The party will have a public-facing voter protection hotline number; a secure, dedicated hotline for precinct chairs which will be made available only to them on caucus day; and an internal hotline for non-reporting related issues, according to a Nevada Democratic Party official.

A total of 41 delegates to the Democratic National Convention were at stake in the February 3 Iowa Democratic caucuses. Thirty-three delegates were up for grabs in the February 12 New Hampshire primary. In the Nevada Democrat caucuses this Saturday, February 22, a total of 36 delegates will be up for grabs.

These first three electoral contests in the 2020 presidential campaign will account for a very small percentage of the 4,750 delegates who will be eligible to cast ballots for the party’s presidential nominee when the Democratic National Convention convenes in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, this July.

Caucuses differ from primaries in several ways. Perhaps the most important way is this: The administration of the election in a primary is handled by the state government through the Secretary of State’s office. In contrast, the administration of a caucus is handled by the political party conducting the caucus.

The steps in the process to determine the winner of the Nevada Democrat caucuses this Saturday are similar the steps in the Iowa Democrat caucuses, but there are several notable differences.

First, early voting, which began in Nevada on Saturday and continues until Tuesday, is allowed.

Second, the caucus day events begin at noon, rather than 7 p.m., as was the case in Iowa.

Third, the “winner” is determined by the number of county convention delegates selected rather than the number of “state delegate equivalents” determined, as is the case in Iowa. (Iowa Democrats select county convention delegates during their caucuses, and then add an additional step, selecting “state delegate equivalents,” who in turn select the state’s convention delegates.)

As was the case in Iowa, the NSDP will report three results from every one of the 1,712 caucus locations in the state, resulting in a cumulative total as follows:

First alignment votes Second alignment votes Final number of county convention delegates selected.

Previously, in 2016, only the number of county convention delegates selected for each candidate was reported.

In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the Nevada Democrat caucuses, securing 52.6 percent of the county delegates selected (6,316). Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) finished in second with 47.3 percent of the county delegates selected (5,678).

Clinton took 20 of the state’s 35 DNC delegates in 2016, compared to Sanders, who took 15.

As was the case in Iowa, the Sanders campaign and others pressed to successfully change the reporting of results in the Nevada Democrat caucuses so that first alignment votes and second alignment votes will be reported, as well as county convention delegates selected.

Early voters in the Nevada Democrat caucuses mark their ballot with their top three presidential candidates, ranked in order of preference. Those ballots are delivered in person to the local caucus locations, and the results will be added after the first alignment on Saturday’s caucus day at each caucus location. (There were 1,712 precincts in 2016. Politico estimates there will be about 2,000 “precinct sites” in 2020.)

On Saturday, in person voting begins at precinct locations across the state, as KIRO reported:

On caucus Day, Nevadans will caucus in two different ways. Voters will caucus in locations across the state beginning at noon. They will fill out a presidential preference card with their first choice for president. Like in Iowa, if the caucus-goer’s first-choice doesn’t meet the “viability threshold” or attract 15% support from the caucus-goers, a voter can “realign,” or pick another candidate who is already viable or the voter can join with others to make help make another candidate viable. The second way Nevadans will vote applies to those who work in Las Vegas’ hospitality industry and the city’s casinos. These caucuses, called “strip caucuses” because it involves employees of the Las Vegas Strip, allow hotel and casino workers who would have trouble getting to caucus sites to caucus in businesses along the Strip. The Strip caucus takes place on Saturday.

Nevada offers a twist on candidate viability determination after the first alignment votes are calculated, not found in Iowa, as KIRO reported:

For precincts electing four or more delegates, the viability threshold is 15%. For precincts electing three delegates, the threshold is one-sixth of the attendees. For precincts electing two delegates, the threshold is 25%.

If it all works as is planned, the first candidate preferences from the early voters will be added to the in-person first alignment numbers for each candidate

It is possible that a number of caucuses around the state may experience delays after the first alignment has been completed before the number of candidates who are “viable”—that is have received more than 15 percent of the first alignment votes cast in person and in early voting—is determined. If it all works as is planned, the number one voter preferences from the early voting preferences will be added to the in-person first alignment numbers for each candidate

Another potential delay could occur in determining the results of the second alignment. While the number of in-person second alignment votes should be relatively easy to determine, the caucus location leaders will have to sort through the early voting results to determine the second presidential candidate preference for early voters whose first presidential candidate preference has been determined to not be “viable” in the first alignment.

After the second alignment results are recorded at each caucus location, a next step in the process—calculating the county convention delegates—must take place, using a formula which appears to have the same kind of weighting process used in the Iowa Democrat caucuses.

It is also possible that when all the results from Saturday’s Nevada caucuses are reported, one candidate may receive more first alignment and/or second alignment votes, while a different candidate receives more county convention delegates votes, so two campaigns may claim victory.

As Breitbart News reported, the victor in the Iowa Democrat caucuses was determined by a complex process that ended in the selection of state delegate equivalents. The candidate with the most state delegate equivalents was declared the winner.

Because of reporting problems, two weeks after the caucuses were held, the Associated Press has yet to declare a winner.

The campaigns of Sanders and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have both declared victory.

Buttigieg’s campaign lays claim to victory in Iowa on the basis that it has, so far, been awarded two more state delegate equivalents than Sanders.

Sanders’ campaign lays claim to victory in Iowa on the basis that Sanders received 6,000 more votes than second place Buttigieg, 24.7 percent to 21.3 percent.",https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/02/18/heres-how-the-winner-will-be-declared-in-nevadas-democrat-caucuses-on-saturday/
195,Singer Chrissie Hynde Praises Trump for Honoring Rush Limbaugh,['Alana Mastrangelo'],"The Pretenders singer Chrissie Hynde praised President Donald Trump for honoring conservative radio icon Rush Limbaugh with the Presidential Medal of Freedom earlier this month. The singer added that her late father “loved listening to Rush,” and would have “enjoyed” the Trump presidency.

“An open letter to [President Trump], President of the United States,” began Hynde in a series of tweets. “Dear Mr. President. I often think of how much my father, Melville ‘Bud’ Hynde, who proudly served his country as a Marine on Guadalcanal, would have enjoyed your Presidency.”

The grammy-nominated singer went on to praise the president for honoring Limbaugh — despite her having differing political views.

“The other day when you gave that award to Rush Limbaugh, my father would have been so delighted,” said Hynde in a follow-up tweet. “He loved listening to Rush, which is why I allowed my song, ‘My City Was Gone’, to be used on his radio show.”

“My father and I didn’t always see eye-to-eye,” she added. “We argued a lot.”

“But isn’t that the American way?” said Hynde. “The right to disagree without having your head chopped off?”

President Trump awarded Limbaugh with the Presidential Medal of Freedom during his State of the Union address earlier this month. The radio host recently announced that he had been diagnosed with advanced lung cancer.

“Soon, I will be participating in a protest in London against the extradition of [Julian Assange] (@wikileaks),” said Hynde. “I know my father would be mortified.”

196,Report: Hollywood Executives ‘Relieved’ Mike Bloomberg Gaining Traction Over Sanders in Race to Face Trump,['David Ng'],"Hollywood celebrities are hitting the campaign trail for presidential hopefuls Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders. But the studio executives who sign their paychecks seem to have a different idea of who will make a good Democratic nominee for president.

The Wrap reported that a dozen Hollywood executives interviewed in the past week — most of whom declined to go on the record — expressed relief that Mike Bloomberg is gaining traction in recent polls, providing a capitalism-friendly alternative to the socialism espoused by Sanders.

“Of course people are relieved to have the option of Bloomberg,” one former studio chief told the Hollywood trade publication. The individual confessed to liking the current economic climate under President Trump but added “I would not want to have to vote for Trump.” A Sanders nomination would leave him little choice, he said.

Another interviewee said Michael Bloomberg is the clear choice for the Democratic nomination. “If I had a wand and I could pick the nominee — it would be Bloomberg. It’s a no brainer,” said the individual. “He’ll be beholden to no one.”

A mid-level studio executive told The Wrap that she attended a recent Bloomberg informational event, which was notable to her because it wasn’t a fundraiser. She said she attended because “we need someone who can beat Trump” and Bloomberg seemed to her to be up for the challenge.

The Wrap noted that Hollywood executives tend to be more concerned with the economy than the celebrities who garner all the media attention for their political endorsements.

“People are super happy to have a non-socialist who is business-friendly running for the Democrats,” Ross Gerber, an L.A.-based investor whose clientele is heavily comprised of Hollywood, told TheWrap.

While some Hollywood stars have called Bloomberg a “racist” for his stop-and-frisk policies as mayor of New York, he has nonetheless picked up a few celebrity endorsements, most notably Wall Street star Michael Douglas, who has campaigned for the candidate.

Judy Sheindlin, known as Judge Judy, has also endorsed Bloomberg, praising him as a centrist Democrat.

But Hollywood stars seem to prefer more progressive and far-left candidates like Sanders and Warren.

Some in Hollywood fear that candidates like Joe Biden and Amy Klobuchar wouldn’t stand a chance against Trump’s abrasive style during a debate, according to The Wrap.

They feel Bloomberg has the New York-style toughness to stand up to Trump in a debate or on social media.

197,Elizabeth Warren Celebrates Support from Trump Basher Patricia Arquette,['Hannah Bleau'],"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is celebrating receiving an endorsement from actress and prominent Hollywood Trump critic Patricia Arquette, who noted her belief that Warren will “rid us of corruption.”

Warren, who is angling to rise back into a competitive position in the Democrat primary race following her abysmal performance in New Hampshire’s primary, thanked Arquette for her endorsement on social media Monday evening.

“Thank you, @PattyArquette, I’m grateful to have you on #TeamWarren!” she wrote.

The Boyhood actress announced her endorsement on social media Monday, describing Warren as “pragmatic,” “responsible,” and someone who will “rid us of corruption.”

“After much deliberation I’m supporting @ewarren for President in the primaries. I think she’s pragmatic and responsible and will work hard to get things done,” the actress wrote to her 411k Twitter followers. “I feel she understand both economic and foreign policy. I feel she will be responsible for our Troops and our National Security. I also believe she will rid us of corruption.”

Arquette stressed Warren’s purported ability to “work across the aisle which likely is the only way we will get things done” and added that she feels as though the presidential hopeful “really cares about everyone.”

“I don’t think she has much for Trump to dig up and I think she is genuine,” she added.

The Oscar-winning actress has long stood as a vocal critic against President Trump, accusing him of running a “corrupt administration” and declaring him a national security risk last November.

In 2018, Arquette claimed that the nation had seen a decrease of civil rights since Trump took office, although she provided no examples to support her bombastic claim.

Arquette follows a long line of high profile leftists who have endorsed Warren, including actress Sally Field, who expressed her excitement for Warren’s bid publicly on Monday.

198,Rosario Dawson Comes Out as LGBTQ While Discussing Her Relationship with Cory Booker,['David Ng'],"Actress Rosario Dawson has revealed that she identifies as LGBTQ in a new interview with Bustle in which the star also discussed her ongoing romantic involvement with former presidential candidate Cory Booker.

Dawson spoke about her sexuality when the online women’s magazine asked about a 2018 Instagram post in which she wrote, “Sending love to my fellow lgbtq+ homies.” The Rent actress explained that the post wasn’t meant to be a coming out, but added that it wasn’t inaccurate either.

“People kept saying that I [came out]… I didn’t do that,” Dawson told Bustle. “I mean, it’s not inaccurate, but I never did come out come out. I mean, I guess I am now.”

The actress was quick to clarify: “I’ve never had a relationship in that space, so it’s never felt like an authentic calling to me.” She didn’t specify which category in the LGBT rubric she identifies as.

Dawson also spoke about Sen. Booker (D-NJ), whom she has been dating publicly for a year.

“It’s the first time I felt like I had to be responsible about my choice of love, which is a challenging thing to do,” she told Bustle. “If you fall in love, you fall in love. But there’s another aspect I had to consider: what this meant in [putting] a microscope on my family and particularly on my daughter.”

She added: “But in each other I think we found our person.”

On Valentine’s Day, Dawson shared a romantic video of her with Booker.

Dawson didn’t say if she will be endorsing any candidate now that Booker has dropped out of the Democratic primary race. The actress told Bustle that she’s going to back whoever becomes the Democratic nominee.

Last year, Dawson joined Booker on the campaign trail, squeezing in joint appearances with her boyfriend in between shooting days of her USA Network series Briarpatch.

Next up for the power couple is a much-needed vacation.

“I’ve burnt out before and burning out is not pretty,” Dawson told the magazine. “And it ends up degrading everything else you’re passionate about… You can’t shoulder all of that burden all the time.”

199,'SNL' Star Kenan Thompson to Host White House Correspondents’ Dinner,['Breitbart News'],"WASHINGTON (AP) — Comedians are making their return to the White House Correspondents’ Dinner after last year’s hiatus.

Kenan Thompson of “Saturday Night Live” and Hasan Minhaj of Netflix’s “Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj” will headline this year’s dinner, which takes place April 25.

Presidents and first ladies have traditionally attended the dinner, which serves as a celebration of the First Amendment as well as a fundraiser for college scholarships. Reporting awards are given out as well.

But President Donald Trump has skipped the dinner throughout his presidency and instead has elected to hold campaign rallies. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether the president would attend this year.

Last year’s dinner featured Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ron Chernow after some dinner attendees and commentators complained that a sharply anti-Trump performance by comedian Michelle Wolf in 2018 was too pointed and unfairly targeted then-White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.

Thompson will serve as this year’s host. Minhaj will be the featured entertainer.

“Kenan and Hasan are two of the most engaged and engaging entertainers in America. I’m thrilled they’ll help us celebrate the role of a free press in our democracy,” said Jonathan Karl, Chief White House correspondent for ABC News and president of the White House Correspondents’ Association.

Thompson is currently in his 17th season on “Saturday Night Live” where he has set a record for the most celebrity impressions performed on the show. In 2018, he received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics and a nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series.

Minhaj won a Peabody award in 2019 for his humorous examination of issues of domestic and global import. He was the entertainer at the 2017 correspondents’ dinner when he was a senior correspondent on “The Daily Show.”",https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2020/02/18/snl-star-kenan-thompson-to-host-whcd-netflixs-hasan-minhaj-returns-as-featured-entertainer/
200,"‘The Price Is Right’ Suspends Taping After Death of Host Drew Carry’s Ex-Fiancée, Amie Harwick",['Warner Todd Huston'],"Iconic game show The Price Is Right has suspended production this week after the death of show host Drew Carey’s ex-fiancée, Amie Harwick.

Harwick, a well-known Hollywood sex therapist, was found outside her apartment building on Saturday seriously injured from a fall from the third story of the building. She later died from her injuries. The victim’s ex-boyfriend, Gareth Pursehouse, was then arrested and charged with murder for allegedly pushing her off a balcony.

The Price Is Right host Drew Carey released a statement upon Harwick’s death reminiscing about his love for Harwick, according to The Wrap.

“Amie and I had a love that people are lucky to have once in a lifetime,” Carey said on Monday. “She was a positive force in the world, a tireless and unapologetic champion for women, and passionate about her work as a therapist. I am overcome with grief. I would like to thank you in advance for giving myself and everyone who loved Amie privacy while we try to work through this tragic situation.”

Carey and Harwick were engaged to be married, but their relationship ended in 2018 before they tied the knot.

The Los Angeles Police Department reported that Harwick had taken a restraining order out against Pursehouse, but the order had lapsed by the time of her death.

201,Rob Reiner: Trump a ‘Malignantly Narcissistic Pathologically Lying Racist’,['David Ng'],"Left-wing filmmaker Rob Reiner used President’s Day to launch a vicious social media tirade against President Donald Trump, employing no fewer than six pejorative adjectives and adverbs to describe the commander in chief.

Rob Reiner urged voters in a tweet to vow to elect a president in November who isn’t a “Malignantly Narcissistic Pathologically Lying Misogynistic Racist.”

The Hollywood director also asked voters to replace President Trump with someone who “believes in The Rule of Law, respects The Constitution, and doesn’t grab women by the pussy.”

“On this President’s Day let US vow that this Nov. we will elect a POTUS who is not a Malignantly Narcissistic Pathologically Lying Misogynistic Racist. One who believes in The Rule of Law, respects The Constitution, and doesn’t grab women by the pussy,” the All in the Family star said.

Reiner has regularly used his Twitter account with nearly 888,000 followers to verbally malign President Trump and his supporters. Last year, he tweeted that anyone who supports President Trump is both a racist and a “racist enabler.”

The President of the United States is a racist. He’s made it abundantly clear his re-election is based on white nationalism. If you support him, there can be no distinction between you being a racist and a racist enabler. They are the same. — Rob Reiner (@robreiner) July 29, 2019

Last week, Reiner called President Trump a “criminal living in our White House.”

202,Napolitano on Roger Stone: ‘Almost Any Judge in the Country Would Order a New Trial’,['Trent Baker'],"During Tuesday’s “Fox & Friends,” Fox News legal analyst Andrew Napolitano commented on an interim U.S. attorney reportedly being “strong-armed” into recommending giving President Donald Trump confidant Roger Stone a hefty sentence for his criminal charges.

Napolitano said it is “pretty obvious” Stone should get a new trial, adding that “almost any judge in the country” would order one, but he is not sure Judge Amy Berman Jackson will.

“I don’t know where this is going to end, he’s scheduled to be sentenced on Thursday,” Napolitano said of the case.

Co-host Pete Hegseth stated, “So, you think a new trial is likely or could come out of this?”

203,President Trump Says He Might Sue over ‘Fraudulent’ Mueller Investigation,['Amy Furr'],"President Trump declared Tuesday the entire Mueller investigation was a scam and if he were not in office, he would sue everyone involved.

The president wrote on social media he might consider seeking legal redress against former special counsel Robert Mueller’s “fraudulent investigation”:

These were Mueller prosecutors, and the whole Mueller investigation was illegally set up based on a phony and now fully discredited Fake Dossier, lying and forging documents to the FISA Court, and many other things. Everything having to do with this fraudulent investigation is… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2020

….BUT MAYBE I STILL WILL. WITCH HUNT! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2020

February 6, Mueller investigator Andrew Weissmann claimed during an interview on MSNBC that the president was going to use the ongoing criminal probe by U.S. Attorney John Durham “to punish those who had investigated him before,” Breitbart News’s Joel B. Pollak wrote.

“And he compared Trump to former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, saying that Trump was also a ‘demagogue’ and ‘amoral,'” Pollak noted.

He continued:

Weissmann also mocked Trump for not submitting himself for questioning by the Mueller probe, or under oath before Congress, even as he noted the president would have been placing himself in “legal jeopardy” by doing so. By the end, Weissman had left little doubt that critics of the anti-Trump bias of the Mueller probe were correct. … Even with Weissmann directing the probe, it failed to find any evidence of “Russia collusion.” The Mueller report attempted to provide evidence of obstruction, but declined to recommend that Trump be prosecuted.

February 11, Judicial Watch (JW) revealed former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein received praise from former Obama administration officials leading up to the May 2017 appointment of Mueller as special counsel.

Citing internal government emails, JW President Tom Fitton stated, “These astonishing emails show that Rod Rosenstein had many Obama/Clinton and media friends supporting him around the time he infamously appointed Robert Mueller.”

The day before Mueller’s appointment, U.S. Attorney John Huber, an Obama appointee, wrote: “Rod, We’re proud of you.”

In an email dated May 12, former Obama Special Counsel Jonathan Su said, “Hi Rod: I know there’s a lot going on right now, but I wanted to send you a note of support. If there’ s anything I can do to be of help, please let me know. Hope you hang in there.”

204,Photos: China’s City Streets Empty as Workers Avoid Coronavirus,['Frances Martel'],"“The outbreak will be short-lived, and it will not affect China’s competitiveness,” the state-run Global Times newspaper proclaimed Tuesday.

While China insists its economic output remains strong, photos from its major economic hubs show millions-strong cities completely deserted, bringing the Chinese economy to a screeching halt.

At press time, China has documented 72,439 cases of the newly discovered coronavirus originating in Wuhan, a central Chinese city of 11 million people. Of those identified as confirmed patients, 1,870 have died within China, the overwhelming majority. While most of those cases have been confirmed in Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province, doctors have confirmed growing numbers of cases in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, some of the most important urban centers to China’s economy.

The Wuhan coronavirus reportedly began spreading in Wuhan in mid-December; the Chinese Communist Party informed the public of the outbreak on January 20. Since then, the virus has spread to every province in the country and to places outside of communist rule like Hong Kong and Macau. To help contain the outbreak, Chinese officials have implemented strict lockdowns forcing many people to work from home. Those who cannot do so, like factory workers who need access to materials and machinery, have simply not been able to work.

In central Wuhan, the government has banned residents from leaving their homes. Former Shanghai Mayor Ying Yong – a loyalist to dictator Xi Jinping recently appointed head of the Communist Party in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located – implemented a ban from being out in public throughout Wuhan and several other cities in the province. According to the South China Morning Post, Ying imposed what he called the “strictest 24-hour lock-down management,” allowing individuals to leave their homes only in cases of emergency and to buy food and necessary supplies every three days. Any exit from a building requires government approval. Needless to say, commuting to work is not on the list of approved reasons to leave the house.

The Morning Post notes that, in total, over 80 cities nationwide have imposed lockdowns.

For Shanghai, Ying’s former city and one of the most important economic centers in the country, this has meant a near-total shutdown of business activity. A poll found this week that nearly 80 percent of companies active in the greater Shanghai area do not have the necessary number of employees present at work to run their companies. In the next month, 41 percent of companies surveyed said a lack of staff was their biggest concern. Shanghai has documented 333 cases of coronavirus and one death.

Shenzhen, the city bordering Hong Kong, has also seen a steep decline in economic activity. Shenzhen’s Guangdong province, largely considered the factory center of the country, has documented 1,328 cases of the virus and four deaths, many more cases than the more centrally located Beijing and Shanghai, though the same number of deaths as the national capital. Shenzhen has been deeply impacted by rural commuter workers choosing not to return to jobs where they may be exposed to the virus. Beijing estimates that as many as two-thirds of those workers are not back in factories nationwide, significantly hindering manufacturing.

In Beijing, the most politically powerful city in the country, largely empty streets suggest a significant disruption in business as usual.

The Communist Party is so concerned about an outbreak in the capital that it is considering the extraordinary move of postponing the “two sessions” – the annual full session of the National People’s Congress (NPC), the country’s rubber-stamp legislature, and of the People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), a celebrity advisory committee – until after the viral outbreak is under control. The “two sessions” typically bring thousands of high-level politicians together from around the country, potentially exposing them all to the outbreak. While the nominal government reason for considering postponement is to ensure these politicians are in their home provinces working on the outbreak, anonymously some in the government have expressed concern that such a large assembly would spread the illness to some of the Party’s most important cadres.

Viral infections among government employees are already a concern, as China has attempted to keep government offices open to show that the outbreak is under control. The Global Times reported on Tuesday that 69 people in one Beijing district office have been quarantined after a public worker tested positive for the virus there. The infected employee had traveled to Hubei province for the Lunar New Year holiday.

The Global Times has nonetheless proclaimed that the demise of the Chinese economy is overestimated.

“The losses are huge, of course, and the specific numbers are yet to be counted, but the absolute numbers are certainly staggering,” the Times admitted on Tuesday in an article called “It Is Naive to Expect Chinese Economy to Collapse.”

Yet China’s sheer size means just as much maneuvering capability, and it is one of the most important indicators of strategic economic resilience. Some of the losses in services can be made up for, and a lot of them are lost, but they won’t be an internal wound to the Chinese economy. Over time, subsequent economic developments will allow the wounds to heal. While China’s economy has suffered, there has been no disruption this time around. The sectors of the economy that support the daily needs of the Chinese are revving up. With the exception of emergency supplies such as face masks, which cannot be expanded to the level of demand, the supply of other daily necessities has not been reduced.

The newspaper also applauded the economy’s “slow yet steady start” this week on Monday.

205,Nobel Prize Nominee: The Only Way for Hong Kong Is Independence,['Frances Martel'],"“The only way for Hongkongers to achieve democracy is to become independent instead of seeking autonomy under the rule of China,” Andy Chan Ho-tin, the founder of the banned Hong Kong National Party, told Breitbart News.

Chan was nominated this month for the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts against communist rule in the nominally autonomous city, which remains in the throes of a pro-democracy protest movement that has brought millions out onto its streets. Those who nominated him note that, unlike other members of the pro-democracy movement seeking merely to keep autonomy under the “One Country, Two Systems” policy that keeps Beijing as Hong Kong’s capital, Chan has for years advocated sovereignty as an independent state.

Chan founded the Hong Kong National Party in 2016, two years after participating in the Umbrella Movement protests that first unsettled Beijing’s hand-picked government in the city. That year, authorities banned him from running for office because he refused to say he supported Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong in a ballot interview with officials; China demands anyone running for office in the country bow to Beijing’s ultimate authority.

The Hong Kong government later declared the party itself illegal; Chan has faced consistent police harassment, detention, and persecution since.

Speaking to Breitbart News this week via email, Chan predicted that the current lull in the protest movement – largely the product of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak forcing locals to avoid crowded public spaces – is temporary.

“The protests will definitely come back when the coronavirus outbreak is over. And more people would join the protests, as the government has performed extremely poorly,” Chan noted. “The protests have cooled down a little bit and then the Wuhan coronavirus broke out. The coronavirus outbreak happened to multiply the effect of the protests. The economy is facing the worst challenge in a few decades.”

Chan noted that the virus originated in China and the Hong Kong government refused to close all its borders to Chinese citizens to prevent the virus from spreading – a choice that prompted thousands of medical workers to strike, protesting that the government was not adequately caring for them. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam nonetheless insisted on leaving three border crossings open, arguing that the links between Hong Kong and China are too strong to cut them completely.

At press time, Hong Kong has documented 58 Wuhan coronavirus cases and one death. The result has been international travel limitations on Hong Kong as well as China to contain the virus.

“Now Hong Kong people were blocked by many countries and considered as Chinese. This reminds Hong Kong people why we should pursue independence from China or we would be isolated by the world,” Chan told Breitbart News. “All in all, the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak once again reminds us China is a serious threat to the world in many ways, that we should contain and isolate China. Hongkongers have to distinguish ourselves apart from Chinese.”

Chan also made the case that it is impossible to trust China to grant true autonomy via “One Country, Two Systems.” Beijing agreed to the policy in 1997, following the United Kingdom’s surrender of Hong Kong to China, vowing to respect capitalism and democracy in Hong Kong so long as Hong Kong did not try to secede and form its own country.",https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/02/18/exclusive-nobel-peace-prize-nominee-the-only-way-for-hong-kong-is-independence/
206,China: Top Excuse for Locking Uyghurs in Camps Is 'Too Many Babies',['Frances Martel'],"A 137-page document detailing China’s systematic repression of Uyghur and other minority Muslims in western Xinjiang province listed that the top reason for sending Muslims to concentration camps in one county as “having too many babies,” Deutsche Welle revealed on Monday.

Deutsche Welle, in cooperation with other media outlets, translated the leaked government documents, which it noted added clarity in how the Chinese communist regime chooses who to institutionalize in the over 1,000 concentration camps built to torture, enslave, rape, and kill Muslim minorities. Reports citing eyewitnesses and document leaks have for years exposed a system that punishes Chinese citizens in Xinjiang for wearing beards, refusing to eat pork, keeping fasting hours during Ramadan, or wearing hijabs. In 2017, China also published a list of banned names for children in Xinjiang, most of them traditional Islamic names common among Uyghurs.

The Deutsche Welle documents listed individuals in Xinjiang’s Karakax County, many of them in concentration camps, but others simply being monitored incessantly through advanced surveillance technology and espionage via private messaging services and social media. The document lists contact with people in Muslim-majority countries, applying for a passport, and other legal activities as red flags in the eyes of the Communist Party that could result in imprisonment in a concentration camp.

“However, the top cause for arrest of Uighurs from Karakax County was violating China’s official birth control policy by having too many babies,” Deutsche Welle reported.

The Communist Party bans all people from having more than two children, an expansion of the long-time one-child policy that has triggered a population crisis in the country. In rural areas, Beijing has exempt religious and ethnic minorities from that limit for years; Uyghurs are allowed three children if they live outside of urban centers. The one-child policy exemptions have resulted in Chinese minorities being among the few not currently in danger of seeing population crashes that could devastate the economy in the next two generations.

Adding to mounting evidence that the concentration camps are part of a broader genocide campaign against Uyghur Muslims, the Karakax County documents show Chinese officials punishing Uyghurs for having large families. Most of those locked into concentration camps, the documents indicate, are young men, both for allegedly violating birth laws and for crimes like being “untrustworthy.”

“This has major implications for demographics and the birth rate,” Rian Thum, a University of Nottingham Uyghur policy expert, said. “If you take a portion — or even the entirety — of a village’s youth, you basically put a pause” on population growth.

Survivors of the concentration camps and human rights groups have accused China of a genocide campaign against Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Muslim ethnic minorities in the west of the country. In addition to making the building of families more difficult, Chinese officials have razed dozens of Muslim cemeteries, many of them with hundreds of years of family history. Chinese officials have claimed that destroying ancient historical sites like cemeteries is necessary to make Uyghurs more “civilized.”

Within the camps, women who have escaped say the Chinese government has forcibly sterilized them, forced them to abort if they are imprisoned while pregnant, and killed their babies. One woman who entered a concentration camp with triplets – imprisoned for traveling to Egypt – said Chinese authorities killed one of her triplets and later claimed he died spontaneously. Another woman said she was sterilized without her consent, or even being told what was happening to her.

Ruqiye Perhat, another survivor, said that “any woman or man under age 35 was raped and sexually abused,” often in front of other prisoners. The rape naturally resulted in pregnancies that Chinese authorities killed.

The Communist Party insists that the camps are necessary “vocational training centers” to keep Muslims from veering into radical terrorist activities. Multiple estimates from American government officials and others suggest that as many as 3 million people are languishing in the camps. In December, Beijing proclaimed that most of them had “graduated,” a euphemism meant to emphasize the claim that the prisoners are learning important job skills in prison. In reality, those who have escaped say that they were forced to memorize Communist Party propaganda and worship dictator Xi Jinping.

The documented published this week, however, show that a small minority of those imprisoned are taken in for that reason, however. Of the 311 people whose every moment Chinese communist officials documented in Karakax, only three were listed as potential jihadists.

The documents also make repeated references to the use of slavery in the camps. China has repeatedly denied the use of slave labor to manufacture products in Xinjiang, despite compelling evidence that products, many even sold in the United States, were manufactured inside camps. The documents show that, privately, the Chinese government does not maintain that conceit.

Karakax is home to four of the over 1,000 concentration camps in Xinjiang.

207,Fmr Congressional Hispanic Caucus Spox: The ‘Economic Realities’ Are Good for Latino Voters,['Trent Baker'],"After writing an op-ed describing the Latino support for President Donald Trump is “real” and a “problem” for Democrats, former spokesman for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Kristian Ramos appeared on Tuesday’s broadcast of “Morning Joe” on MSNBC.

Host Joe Scarborough asked Ramos what it is about Trump and his policies that are bringing Latinos over to him.

Ramos said Democrats are underperforming in the Latino community, while the “economic realities” are good under Trump.

“What we’re looking at is an underperformance on the Democratic side, but speaking to Donald Trump, what the reality is the most important issue to all Latino voters is the economy,” Ramos stated. “If you’re looking at the same Telemundo poll and you’re looking at Nevada voters, they think that they’re doing pretty well as far as their economic realities are concerned.”

Ramos’ remarks echo what Job Creators Network CEO Alfredo Ortiz has previously said about Trump’s economy being “incredible” for Latinos, especially those who own their own businesses.

208,Nolte: Bloomberg Lies About Farmer Video Being Taken Out of Context,['John Nolte'],"Democrat presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg was caught on video trashing farmers as idiots, and now he’s lying about being taken out of context.

If there’s anything we’re discovering about Bloomberg — the former New York City mayor, the fifty-billion-dollar man, the last hope the jackass party has to stop a Jurassic Socialist from winning the nomination — it’s that when he believes he’s talking privately to a small group of fellow elites, he says things that make Barack Obama’s “bitter clinger” comments sound unifying.

Bloomberg has already been caught admitting to using New York’s “stop and frisk” policy to target young black men. He’s already been caught trashing blacks and Hispanics as too ignorant and uncivilized to find employment. And now he’s been caught ridiculing farmers as simpletons and idiots.

Worse still, Bloomberg is now denying he said what he clearly said, and naturally, some in the fake news media are attempting to gaslight us into believing the Tiny Tyrant is being taken out of context.

Well, he’s not being taken out of context, and his comments about farmers not only reflect his bigoted, urban elitism, they reflect a bubbled ignorance you can hardly wrap your mind around.

Here are Bloomberg’s comments in full, comments he made during a 2016 appearance at the University of Oxford:

If you think about it, the agrarian society lasted 3,000 years, and we could teach processes. I could teach anybody, even people in this room so no offense intended, to be a farmer. It’s a process. You dig a hole, you put a seed in, you put dirt on top, add water, up comes the corn. You could learn that. Then you have 300 years of the industrial society. You put the piece of metal on the lathe, you turn the crank in the direction of the arrow, and you can have a job. And we created a lot of jobs. At one point, 98 percent of the world worked in agriculture; today it’s two percent in the United States. Now comes the information economy, and the information economy is fundamentally different because it’s built around replacing people with technology, and the skill-sets you have to learn are how to think and analyze, and that is a whole degree/level different. You have to have a different skill-set; you have to have a lot more gray matter. It’s not clear the teachers can teach or the students can learn, and so the challenge of society of finding jobs for these people, who we can take care of giving them a roof over their head and a meal in their stomach and a cell phone and a car and that sort of thing. But the thing that will stop them from setting up a guillotine someday, is the dignity of a job.

Here’s the video. The comments start at right around the 42 minute mark.

After the farmer comments went viral, Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey released a statement accusing Democrat presidential front-runner Bernie Sanders and Team Trump of taking the Tiny Tyrant out of context:

The latest example comes today, with the Sanders campaign circulating a video of Mike’s comments — also shared by Donald Trump Jr. — that is taken completely out of context; the video cuts off Mike’s first sentence where he is referring to agrarian society that lasted 3,000 years, not farmers today. In just the past three months, Mike has traveled to 26 states. During that time, he has met with farmers and heard directly about the struggles they face. The Bernie Sanders campaign is choosing to push out falsehoods and sow divisions within the Democratic party.

Obviously, anyone who watches the original video, or who reads the full context of the transcript, knows Bloomberg was definitely not taken out of context — not even close.

To begin with, he’s not talking about agrarian society as it existed 3,000 years ago, he’s talking about an agrarian society that lasted 3,000 years. Everything he says, everything he refers to, is in the present tense. This is made clear when he says, “I could teach anybody, even people in this room so no offense intended, to be a farmer.”

He’s not talking about teaching people to farm 3,000 years ago, he’s talking about teaching them to be a farmer today.

Hey, any yokel can be a farmer. Anyone! It’s so easy!

The fact that he’s speaking in present tense is made even clearer when he says, “and the skill-sets you have to learn are how to think and analyze, and that is a whole degree/level different. You have to have a different skill-set; you have to have a lot more gray matter.”

Again, he is not talking about how farmers from 3,000 years ago would lack the gray matter and skill-set, he’s talking about the “gray matter” problem with farmers (and factory workers) today.

How do we train these RedStateTards? You can’t! They’re too stupid!

The overall point Bloomberg is making is What the hell do we do with all these stupid farmers and factory workers, how do we do more than give them welfare? (“a roof over their head and a meal in their stomach and a cell phone and a car and that sort of thing”). He is quite obviously saying How do we train today’s stupid farmers and factory workers who are probably incapable of learning how to exist in the information age? (“It’s not clear the teachers can teach or the students can learn, and so the challenge of society of finding jobs for these people”).

In order to believe Bloomberg was talking about farmers 3,000 years ago, or factory workers 300 years ago, you would have to believe that while speaking at Oxford, he went off into some bizarre flight of fancy about the difficulties that would occur if a time machine started to transport people from the past into the present. But again, Bloomberg has such a low opinion of the intelligence of us simple folk, he probably thinks he can get away with an absurd claim of being taken out of context.

You know, I spent three long summers working on a small, 16-cow dairy farm. So I know a thing or two about farming, and other than being awed by how hard farmers work, nothing was more impressive than the intelligence required to be a successful farmer.

What you have in farmers, in this case my grandfather and grandmother, are people who are so smart and resourceful, they’re able to do pretty much everything. They not only have to be meteorologists and botanists in order to ensure the crops come in, they have to be veterinarians as a means to keep their animals healthy.

What’s more, my grandparents knew how to butcher, dry, can, and jar food. They were also experts in the arts of construction and mechanics.

Believe this… You cannot be a successful farmer as a jack-of-all trades-master-of-none. You either master them all or you quickly go bankrupt paying others to come in and solve your problems.

My grandfather was not only resourceful, he was an inventor. I still remember how he used pulleys, springs, and a barrel of gravel to make it easy for my grandmother to lift a garage door. I still remember him welding a piece of metal into a massive handle that attached to a spring, which allowed us to release the clutch when standing on the hitch of the tractor. This brilliant invention saved enormous time and effort because we didn’t have to climb onto the tractor to drive 20 feet to the next bale of hay that needed to be picked up. By the way, this tractor pulled a wagon he built that was only six inches off the ground, which made throwing those bales much, much easier.

You want to know how smart my farmer-grandparents were? Even as a teenager who thought he was smarter than everyone, who worked overtime to act unimpressed by everything, I never stopped being shocked by how capable they were. Their resourcefulness was so impressive, it overcame my near fatal case of teenage arrogance.

And that was 40 years ago.

Imagine the resourcefulness required of farmers today in the digital age — where they’re dealing with computers, GPS, the genetic engineering of plants and animals, and a dozen things I’m missing because I haven’t worked on a farm since 1985 — but unlike Bloomberg, I have enough life experience and humility to admit I don’t know what I don’t know.

And here’s a final point that needs to be made.

If Michael Bloomberg and everyone like Michael Bloomberg and all the companies they created disappeared tomorrow… If I disappeared tomorrow, and all the people who do what I do disappeared tomorrow… If every artist, movie star, pundit, writer, cable TV network, cable news network, newspaper, journalist, radio station, movie studio, poet, and playwright disappeared tomorrow… Yes, we would miss them, but after a couple weeks we would adjust and move on.

The farmer, however, is indispensable. Without the farmer we all die.

Mike Bloomberg is an elitist, a tiny tyrant, and a liar. So, in a way, the world would actually be much, much, much better off without him.

Bloomberg might be smart, but he is shockingly and unforgivably bigoted, dishonest, and ignorant.",https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/02/18/nolte-bloomberg-lies-about-farmer-video-being-taken-out-of-context/
209,SD Gov. Noem: Bloomberg Farmers Comment ‘Pompous Ignorance’ — ‘Who Does Mike Bloomberg Think He Is?’,['Jeff Poor'],"Tuesday on the Fox News Channel, Gov. Kristi Noem (R-SD) slammed former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, for his comments on farmers.

The governor of the heavily agricultural South Dakota described the remarks as “pompous ignorance.”

“You know, that comment is nothing but pompous ignorance,” Noem said. “Who does Mike Bloomberg think he is? You know, every single day, farmers work long hours, but they don’t just have to deal with the labor side. They understand genetics and engineering, biology, chemistry. It is incredibly difficult for farmers, every day, to feed the world. And I’m just so proud. My entire family is farmers. I’ve been a farmer my entire life. His comment is so out of touch with everyday Americans.”

210,"In Utah, Pete Buttigieg Defends Mitt Romney for Voting to Impeach Donald Trump",['Charlie Spiering'],"Former Mayor Pete Buttigieg on Monday defended Senator Mitt Romney for voting to impeach President Donald Trump, praising the senator for acting on his faith and conscience.

“The Senate was not prepared to do its duty and I know that it can be discouraging, demoralizing, and exhausting,” he said during a campaign rally in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Someone in the crowd shouted, “Mitt Romney!” prompting Buttigieg to grin and reply, “That’s right!” as the crowd applauded.

He continued:

If your senator, who I disagree with on all kinds of things, but I think we can agree followed his conscience on this matter, because he was more worried about his relationship with his conscience and with his maker than his relationship with the Republican party, if he was alone in doing that, if he was the only one, doesn’t that say more about what has become of the Republican party in Washington today than anything else?

Buttigieg, an Episcopalian, argued his own faith was proof he was the right Democrat to challenge Trump, who he ridiculed for trying to “cloak himself in religion.”

“Don’t you think he ought to be called to account by a nominee that is not afraid to remind fellow believers that God does not belong to a political party?” Buttigieg asked. “A person of faith who also understands that this country and it’s Constitution belong to people of every religion and no religion equally because that’s what our Constitution says?”

Buttigieg encouraged all voters across the country to unite to defeat Trump and the Republican-led senate.

“Here’s the good news, the senate may have been the jury then, but the verdict is up to us now and we get the last word on this president and on so many of those senators that protected him,” he said.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/18/in-utah-pete-buttigieg-defends-mitt-romney-for-voting-to-impeach-donald-trump/
211,Exclusive — Cotton Launches Plan to Retake House Majority with Vets,['Matthew Boyle'],"Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) has launched a new effort to support fellow veterans in bids for Congress as part of an organized campaign designed to help Republicans secure their U.S. Senate majority and retake the majority in the U.S. House in November.

Cotton, a U.S. Army veteran who served in both Iraq and Afghanistan before his election in 2012 to the U.S. House, told Breitbart News exclusively that he is rolling out a series of endorsements of veterans running in key battleground House districts nationwide this year.

Cotton, in 2014, won a U.S. Senate seat in Arkansas, and he is running for re-election this year unopposed, as the only Democrat to file against him later dropped out of the race, leaving Democrats with no candidate—and Cotton with lots of free time and extra campaign resources to help Republicans nationally.

He intends to help veterans get their campaigns off the ground in order to secure the GOP majority in the U.S. Senate and recapture the majority in the U.S. House for Republicans.

“In many cases the veterans I’ve endorsed or will be endorsing are first-time candidates as I was in 2012,” Cotton said in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News on Monday afternoon. “I want to provide effective coaching and mentoring to them the way some previous office-holders provided to me in 2012, and help them understand the way they can translate their record of service into the campaign setting. So, for instance, all Americans respect veterans—they respect veterans for their service, and in many cases, like in Jason Church, their many sacrifices, like both of his legs in Afghanistan. That is a great door-opener for them. There’s almost no voter in America who will not listen to that veteran on the campaign trail because of that veteran’s record of service, but then they have to translate that into what they hope to accomplish for Americans in Congress just like they did overseas. So, of course, I am focused on Republican veterans and Republican veterans who share some of my priorities, like controlling our immigration system, getting serious about crime and law and order, trying to stand up to adversaries like China, all of things which are usually not going to be in a veteran’s record of service in the military. So, what I’ve done with some of these veterans and what I’ll continue to do with them is to share some of my hard-won experiences in 2012 as a first-time candidate so they can maybe learn it the easy way. Then, there’s other things too—of course I’ll give them maximum financial support from my political action committee, I raise money for them online and from loyal conservative donors around the country who want to support veteran candidates, and in many cases over the course of the next nine months or so I intend to go campaign with them too.”

Cotton has previously backed other veterans like Reps. Mike Gallagher (R-WI) and Dan Crenshaw (R-TX), as well as Jason Church, who is running in a special election on Tuesday in Wisconsin. But now he intends to expand that effort as part of a broader push to help the GOP solidify its U.S. Senate majority in the 2020 campaign, as well as giving Republicans a chance at retaking the House majority from Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s Democrats.

“So I’ve supported a number of veterans in the past, like Mike Gallagher from Wisconsin in the 2016 cycle and Dan Crenshaw in last cycle and Jason Church in the special election in Wisconsin tomorrow,” Cotton said in the interview. “Given that I don’t have a Democratic opponent in Arkansas this cycle, I wanted to devote more of my effort to helping to elect veterans up and down the ballot for the House and for the Senate as well. Veterans have very strong assets, they are well-respected by our fellow citizens, and they also just need a little help as first-time candidates to learn how to be effective candidates and learn how to run an effective campaign and how to translate their record of service in the military to how they can serve their states and their districts in Congress. So, I’m very excited to be endorsing these candidates like I’ve done in the past, and there will be more to come in the future.”

The first four conservative veterans that Cotton is endorsing in key House districts in 2020 are August Pfluger in Texas’s 11th congressional district, Wesley Hunt in Texas’s 7th congressional district, Esther Joy King in Illinois’ 17th congressional district, and Dan Driscoll in North Carolina’s 11th congressional district.

Pfluger, an Air Force veteran, flew 300 combat hours as an F-22 Raptor fighter pilot against the Islamic State. King served as a JAG officer in the Army Reserves. Driscoll, a U.S. Army veteran, was a Cavalry Scout Platoon Leader in Iraq. Hunt, another Iraq veteran and West Point graduate, was an Apache helicopter pilot in the U.S. Army.

Texas’s 11th and North Carolina’s 11th are both deep-red GOP districts represented by retiring GOP congressmen—Rep. Mike Conaway (R-TX) is retiring from Texas, and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) is retiring from North Carolina—but the other two districts are key battleground districts in which the House majority could be decided.

While Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton did win Texas’s 7th district over President Donald Trump in 2016, it is a traditionally GOP district. It was represented by Republicans for decades, dating back to 1967, and is rated by the Cook Political Report to have a Partisan Voting Index (PVI) of R plus 7. Nonetheless, freshman Democrat Rep. Lizzie Fletcher (D-TX) won the seat in the 2018 midterm elections—but Republicans, including Cotton, given his endorsement of Hunt, think they can win it back in 2020.

Illinois’ 17th district, meanwhile, is one of the 30 vaunted Trump-won districts currently represented by a Democrat. Trump became the first GOP presidential candidate in decades to win the district, defeating Clinton by just under a percentage point. The district, however, is represented by Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-IL)—a Democrat who happens to also lead the Democrats’ congressional campaign and fundraising arm, known as the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC).

While this slate of four endorsements represents his first round of veteran candidates Cotton is backing in 2020, Cotton told Breitbart News he intends to back many more—and believes strong veterans could be the key to retaking the House majority for Republicans in November.

“The path to the House majority runs through the so-called ‘Trump districts,’ where Donald Trump won a congressional district that is currently held by a Democrat,” Cotton told Breitbart News. “And, in a majority of those districts we have veterans running for the Republican Party. Again, I think being a veteran is a door-opener unlike anything else in American politics. And, those veterans in those Trump districts are uniquely positioned to appeal to some of those voters who probably stayed home in 2018 and allowed the Democrat to win those districts. Those voters are going to be coming out in droves in 2020 to vote for President Trump, and I think we’ll have veterans in many of those districts who will help flip those districts and ultimately win back the House as well.”

There are currently 30 districts represented by Democrats that Trump won in 2016, and another 20 or so that Clinton won that Republicans believe are competitive. To retake the House majority in 2020, Republicans need to flip a net 18 seats from the Democrats to GOP control—17 if they win the upcoming special election in California’s 25th congressional district, a battleground that Clinton won in 2016 but Republicans lost in 2018 before now former Rep. Katie Hill (D-CA) was forced to resign in disgrace over a sex scandal.

Many establishment media outlets do not believe the House majority is in play in 2020, but Cotton thinks they are all wrong—as they have been many times before.

“Yet again, the establishment media could not be more wrong. In the winter of 2010, and in the winter of 2018, the establishment media said of course the House is not in play, yet by the fall they were mistaken,” Cotton told Breitbart News. “They are mistaken once again. The House is very much in play, and the path to the majority runs through Trump districts—the majority in which we can have a veteran on the ballot in November. That’s one of the ways we will win back the majority to make sure we don’t see the kind of wasted year that we’ve seen over the last year from the Nancy Pelosi-led House of Representatives.”

Cotton has already, as he mentioned earlier in this interview, endorsed another veteran in Jason Church in Wisconsin’s 7th congressional district GOP primary in the special election. That is a district Republicans intend to hold in the special election called after now former Rep. Sean Duffy (R-WI) stepped down last year. Church lost both of his legs in an IED attack while serving in the U.S. Army in Afghanistan.

Cotton has also already endorsed another veteran, retired Army Gen. Don Bolduc, for U.S. Senate in New Hampshire. Bolduc is running for the GOP nomination for a shot at taking on Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) in November. Bolduc retired at the rank of Brigadier General after a 36-year career in the U.S. Army.

Overall, look for Cotton to aggressively engage on the 2020 campaign trail with GOP candidates who served their country in uniform before running for office—a strategy he thinks could undercut the strategy that put the Democrats in the majority in the House last year.

“In many of the districts where the Democrats made their majority in 2018, they did in fact run veterans,” Cotton told Breitbart News. “I think that proves my point that Americans are willing to give an audience to veteran candidates, even first-time unknown candidates, especially against establishment traditional career politicians. It just so happens that many of those Democrat veterans, I strongly disagree with their political views—whether it’s supporting the most grotesque kinds of partial-birth abortion or trying to take away the guns of law-abiding Americans or having open borders for America—but it is an example of the point I’m making, which is the American people are willing to give any veteran of any political stripe at least an audience to make the case about how they will improve the lives of voters once they’re in political office, just like they did when they risked their lives while they were in the military. That’s why I think it’s so important to put this effort in this cycle into trying to recruit and coach more veteran candidates as Republicans.”",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/18/exclusive-tom-cotton-plans-to-back-veterans-for-congress-in-gop-bid-to-retake-house-we-will-win-back-the-majority/
212,Poll: Bernie Sanders Leads Rivals by 12% Nationwide; Mike Bloomberg Qualifies for Nevada Debate,['Joel B. Pollak'],"RENO, Nevada — A new poll shows Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) surging to a double-digit lead over his rivals nationwide — and billionaire Mike Bloomberg qualifying for Wednesday’s Democrat debate.

The National Public Radio/Marist/PBS Newshour poll, released early Tuesday morning, shows Sanders with 31%, far ahead of Bloomberg, who is in second place with 19%. The poll was conducted Feb. 13-16 — i.e. after the New Hampshire primary — on land lines and mobile phones among a sample of 527 “Democrats and Democratic leaning independents” registered to vote, with a 5.4% margin of error.

The poll shows that Sanders is clearly the frontrunner — and it is also the fourth qualifying national poll to show Bloomberg at or above 10%, meaning that he will qualify for Wednesday’s debate in Las Vegas ahead of the 11:59 p.m. ET deadline Tuesday night, though he is not on the ballot in Saturday’s Nevada caucuses. Fellow billionaire Tom Steyer, who is at 2% in seventh place in the poll, has met the polling threshold required by the Democratic National Committee (DNC), but not yet in “qualifying” polls.

After Sanders with 31%, and Bloomberg with 19%, come former Vice President Joe Biden in third, with 15%; Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in fourth, with 12%; Sen. Amy Klobuchar in fifth, with 9%; and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg in sisxth, with 8%. Buttigieg currently leads in terms of delegates after finishing second in total votes in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.

The debate will be held Wednesday evening from 9:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. ET (6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. PT) at the Paris Theater in Las Vegas, hosted by MSNBC. Six candidates have qualified thus far.

213,"Tom Steyer Hits 10% Debate Threshold in Four Polls, but None of Them Counts",['Joel B. Pollak'],"RENO, Nevada — Left-wing billionaire Tom Steyer would have qualified for Wednesday’s Democrat debate by Monday evening, but the arcane rules of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) may keep him from the stage.

With barely 24 hours to go before the 11:59 p.m. ET deadline on Tuesday, Steyer has yet to meet the minimum criteria of receiving “10% or more support in at least four polls (which may be national polls, or single-state polls of South Carolina, and/or Nevada) ” or “12% or more support in two single-state polls in South Carolina and/or Nevada.”

On Monday, Steyer received 10% in a “Data for Progress” poll in Nevada, but it is not included in the DNC’s approved list of “qualifying” polls. He also received 11% in a recent Las Vegas Review-Journal poll, but that poll was dropped by the DNC last year.

Steyer has also received 14% and 18% in two recent South Carolina polls, but those were also conducted by entities not appearing on the DNC’s approved list, even though they are politically independent.

Therefore Steyer has, in fact, met or exceeded the DNC’s criteria, whether 10% for four polls and 12% for two polls in early states — but unless more polls emerge before Tuesday night, he will not qualify.

As Breitbart News reported, Steyer wrote last week to the DNC to ask it to extend the window for qualification back in time, noting there had been no qualifying polls in Nevada or South Carolina for weeks.

The DNC lists the “qualifying polls” as follows:

Each poll must be sponsored by one of the following 14 entities or pairs of entities (“Qualifying Poll Sponsors”): Associated Press; ABC News/Washington Post; CBS News/YouGov; CNN; Fox News; Monmouth University; National Public Radio; NBC News/Wall Street Journal; NBC News/Marist; New York Times; Nevada Independent/Mellman Group; Quinnipiac University; USA Today/Suffolk University; Winthrop University. For individual entities that are included only in Qualifying Poll Sponsor pairs but are not listed individually, independent polling by such individual entities or polling conducted in new partnerships with such individual entities shall not meet the Qualifying Poll Criteria. The DNC reserves the right to add a Nevada-specific or South Carolina-specific poll sponsor to this list in the near future.

If Steyer failed to make the stage in Nevada, it would be additionally disappointing given the money he has spent focusing on the state: at one point he alone accounted for more than 90% of the political ad spending on television in both Nevada and South Carolina.

Another billionaire in the same boat is former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who benefited from new rules changes at the DNC that dropped the requirement for a minimum number of campaign donors. Bloomberg still needs to hit 10% in one more poll by a DNC-approved pollster to make the stage on Wednesday night. (He is not on the ballot in Nevada, but is seeking to enter the national spotlight.)

On Monday evening, Steyer aides — including Steyer, son, Sam — gathered at a bar in Reno to meet with local community leaders whom they hope to enlist in their cause, with or without the debate.

The focus of the gathering was climate change policy, but there was ample discussion of early voting, which continues through Tuesday, and the Saturday caucuses themselves, which will be held at noon.

The debate, hosted by MSNBC, will be held at the Paris Theater in Las Vegas from 9:00 to 11:00 p.m. ET Wednesday.

The candidates who have qualified thus far are: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT); former Vice President Joe Biden; former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA); and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN). All finished in the top five in Iowa and New Hampshire.

It is unclear if any new qualifying polls will be released before the Tuesday deadline.

214,Bernie Sanders Picks Up Key Endorsement from Influential Latino Group,['Hannah Bleau'],"Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) picked up a key endorsement from the influential Latino group Mijente — the same group that hosted an event where Sanders vowed to halt deportations and provide Medicare for All and free college to illegal immigrants — days ahead of the highly-anticipated February 22 Nevada caucuses.

The group, which describes itself as a “political home for multi-racial Latinx and Chicanx people,” endorsed Sanders’ presidential bid on Tuesday, marking the first time the organization has issued a presidential endorsement.

“Trump’s re-election is a direct threat to our communities. Sen. @BernieSanders has a long history of progressive stances + consistently remains on side of working people,” the group wrote on social media. “That’s why we’re proud to endorse Sanders for president.”

“We need a president who will fight like hell for change that is long overdue & who will not quickly return to pre-Trump, quasi-progressive policies,” it continued.

“With over 70% of the vote, a majority of Mijente members agree that Sanders is the best path to mobilize Latinxs & beat Trump,” it added:

The group’s co-founder, Marisa Franco, said members chose Sanders after a series of meetings with candidates. Members ultimately voted on four options, which included endorsing Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), both, or no one.

“In the end, 70 percent of its members voted to endorse Sanders,” Politico reported.

The group affirmed its plans to mobilize supporters in Nevada days ahead of the caucuses, which could further boost Sanders’ performance among Latino voters in the Silver State. A recently released Telemundo poll showed Joe Biden (D) holding a slight edge among Latino voters in Nevada, with 34 percent to Sanders’ 31 percent. No other candidate came close.

Per Politico:

The organization will use its reach on social media, its roughly 1,000 dues-paying members and more than 300,000-person email list to mobilize Latinos to vote and hit the pavement for Sanders in Nevada and other states. Sanders’ economic justice platform and moratorium on deportations were key to Mijente’s members in addition to Sanders’ exhaustive outreach to Latinos this cycle. “Something that’s very appealing to people is his consistency and the concept of palabra,” said Franco, “And what that means in our community is giving people your ‘word.’”

Franco added that they did not choose Sanders to be a “savior,” adding, “We didn’t pick him to be the fixer of all things.”

The group also plans to assist Sanders in other key states such as California, Texas, Arizona, and Georgia.

Sanders spoke at the group’s “El Chisme 2020″ last year, where he promised to end ICE raids, impose a moratorium on all deportations from the United States, and extend Medicare for All and tuition-free college to illegal immigrants.

“We’re gonna end the ICE raids which are terrorizing communities all across this country,” Sanders told the group.

“We are gonna impose a moratorium on deportations,” he continued. “There are some things that a president can do with executive orders.”

“Let me also say something of which I have gotten into trouble and people will criticize me for,” he continued, reiterating his belief in providing Medicare for All and free college for illegal immigrants.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/18/bernie-sanders-picks-key-endorsement-influential-latino-group/
215,BYU Counselors Create Safe Space for Offended Students,['Tom Ciccotta'],"Counselors at Brigham Young University created a “safe space” for students to discuss a series of anonymous messages published to the internet during a recent campus panel event on race.

According to a report by the College Fix, BYU created a “safe space” on Friday for students to gather and discuss their reaction to a series of anonymous messages that were published during a campus panel event on race.

During the lecture event, attendees were invited to pose questions to panelists via an anonymous online service. “Why do we celebrate Black history? Why not Mexican history Or white history?” one user wrote. “Why don’t we have any white people on stage?” another user wrote. “What is the percentage of African Americans on food stamps?” another user added.

The university quickly responded to the anonymous messages. In a series of tweets that were published last week, the university said that it could not identify the people that submitted the messages.

“Faculty advisors over last night’s panel are creating a report of the incident that will be shared and discussed with university administrators,” the university wrote in a Twitter thread. “We are unable to determine the identities of the commenters, and if they are BYU students or not, but regardless, these are important issues for us to continue to address as a campus.”

216,The Atlantic: Conservative Students Really Do Self-Censor on Campus,['Tom Ciccotta'],"A column published in the Atlantic on Sunday provided evidence for the claim that conservative students engage in self-censorship on campus. A new survey out of the University of North Carolina revealed that many students censor themselves in the classroom to avoid facing academic or social repercussions.

According to a column in the Atlantic, a new research study backs up the claim that conservative students censor their own opinions on college campuses.

The study, which was highlighted on Sunday by columnist Conor Friedersdorf, was conducted last spring by three professors at the University of North Carolina. The professors surveyed more than 1,000 students about their willingness to express their political beliefs on campus.

Summarizing the study’s finding, Friedersdorf said that the survey revealed that there actually is a faction of students that believe it is permissible to shut down speech that they find offensive. More importantly, the survey revealed that students across the political spectrum engage in self-censorship. Conservatives, in particular, might be more inclined to do so because the survey revealed that disparaging comments about conservative viewpoints are common on campus.

While majorities favor more viewpoint diversity and free-speech norms, an intolerant faction of roughly a quarter of students believe it is okay to silence or suppress some widely held views that they deem wrong.

Students across political perspectives engage in classroom self-censorship.

Students harbor divisive stereotypes about classmates with different beliefs, and a substantial minority are not open to engaging socially with classmates who don’t share their views.

Disparaging comments about political conservatives are common.

Concerns over self-censorship on college campuses are not new. Breitbart News reported in October 2016 that on a Yale student survey that revealed that students felt that conservative views were “unwelcome” on campus. An astonishing 75 percent of Yale student respondents said that Yale does not “provide a welcoming environment for conservative students to share their opinions on political issues.”

A survey by College Pulse found that 73 percent of strongly conservative students self-censor to protect their grades.

217,Harvard Law Refuses to Explain Why Scalia Professorship Remains Unfilled,['Tom Ciccotta'],"Harvard Law School is refusing to explain why a professorship named after late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has been left unfilled for almost three years.

According to a report by the College Fix, Harvard University won’t explain why they haven’t filled a law school professorship that was named after the late Justice Antonin Scalia. The position, which was created in 2017, has yet to be filled.

“Filling this Chair with someone whose appointment would honor the Justice’s great legacy is two and a half years overdue,” first-year law student Eli Nachmany said.

Harvard announced last week that Harvard Law School would release a collection of papers from Justice Scalia’s 30-year-career on the United States Supreme Court. The professorship was created as part of an agreement with Scalia’s family in which they agreed to donate his collection of papers to the university. News about the release of the Scalia collection reignited criticisms over the school’s failure to fill the professorship.

Martha Minow, who was serving as dean of the law school when the professorship was announced, praised Scalia as a man who loved to learn.

“He also had a great love of learning, so it is especially meaningful that he will be honored with a professorship that will provide enduring support for teaching and scholarship at the Law School and beyond,” Minow said in 2017. The Scalia professorship “stands as both a testament to Justice Scalia’s legacy on the Supreme Court and as a vote of confidence in a new generation of scholars.”

Nachmany has started a campaign to remind Harvard of its duty to fill the professorship. In a brief comment to the College Fix, Nachmany argued that students are currently being deprived of the important legal perspective that Scalia brought to the court.

Originalism is the prevailing method of jurisprudence on the Supreme Court, and is the philosophy of many lower court judges now that President Trump has remade the federal judiciary. Harvard Law School would do its students a great service by hiring originalist scholars onto the faculty, and the Scalia Chair offers a unique opportunity for the school to do that in the here and now.

218,Bankruptcy Filed by Boy Scouts of America over Sex Abuse Lawsuits,['Simon Kent'],"The Boy Scouts of America (BSA) has sought bankruptcy protection in a move the group says will allow it to build a compensation fund for sex abuse victims and address hundreds of outstanding claims for redress.

The move follows a number of lawsuits filed against the organisation over claims of sexual abuse, alleging it failed to prevent hundreds of cases dating back over decades.

Most of the newly surfacing cases date to the 1960s, ’70s and ’80s; the organisation says there were only five known abuse victims in 2018.

All civil lawsuits against it are now on hold as a result of the bankruptcy application as the group is struggling with declining membership as well as the abuse claims.

“The BSA cares deeply about all victims of abuse and sincerely apologises to anyone who was harmed during their time in scouting. We are outraged that there have been times when individuals took advantage of our programs to harm innocent children,” chief executive Roger Mosby said in a statement.

Court papers filed in Delaware listed liabilities of up to $1bn and assets of as much as $10bn, reports say.

Among the matters to be addressed in the bankruptcy court are the fate of the Boy Scouts’ assets; the extent to which the organisation’s insurance will help cover compensation; and whether assets of the Scouts’ 261 local councils will be added to the fund.

As Breitbart News reported, the Boy Scouts of America first mooted filing for bankruptcy back in 2018.

On that occasion leadership of the youth organization hired the law firm Sidley Austin LLP to explore a wide range of options, including petitioning for relief under Chapter 11.

Legal experts noted then that filing for bankruptcy would “stave off” at least 140 lawsuits filed against the organization alleging misconduct by scoutmasters.

The Boys Scouts of America has undertaken rebranding efforts since, with the nonprofit renaming itself “Scouts BSA” in 2019.

In May last year, BSA announced girls will be allowed to join the group in the future. “We wanted to land on something that evokes the past but also conveys the inclusive nature of the program going forward,” Surbaugh said at the time of the announcement.

“We’re trying to find the right way to say we’re here for both young men and young women.”

In the 14 months since then, the youth organization has allowed children who identify as girls to join the Scouts, a controversial move that was seen by some, including Girl Scouts of the USA President Kathy Hopinkah Hannan, as an attempt to raise their diminished enrollment numbers.

The 100-year-old organization could now be forced to sell off some of its vast property holdings to raise money for a compensation fund that could surpass $1 billion.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/18/bankruptcy-filed-by-boy-scouts-of-america-over-sex-abuse-lawsuits/
219,Watch: ‘Jetman’ Takes to the Skies over Dubai ‘Iron Man’-Style,['Simon Kent'],"French daredevil Vince Reffet has soared over Dubai after taking off from the ground and climbing to nearly 6,000 feet in a feat reminiscent of Marvel’s Iron Man.

The Crown Prince of Dubai shared a video to his Instagram account Monday showing the first autonomous human flight in the city via a vertical takeoff.

“A major milestone in the quest to achieve 100% autonomous human flight. Well done boys,” Sheik Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum captioned the post, along with the hashtags “#MissionHumanFlight #JetmanDubai #ExpoDubai2020.” Watch below:

﻿

Within seconds, Reffet reached more than 325 feet and within 30 seconds reached an initial height of 3,280 feet at an average speed of 130 knots, according to Gulf Today.

By the end of the three-minute flight, reaching an altitude of nearly 6,000 feet, Reffet opened a parachute and landed safely back at Skydive Dubai, according to the newspaper.

Three engineers – Mohammed Rashid Chembankandy from India, André Bernet from Switzerland and chief engineer Matthieu Courtois from France – developed the pioneering technology that helped make this possible.

Together they built and adjusted a manually controlled thrust vectoring nozzle that allows the pilot to control rotations around the yaw axis at zero speeds, making human control of the wing possible in all flight phases without the aid of any electronic stabilisation systems.

Reffet and his collaborators, known as “Jetmen”, have used jetpacks and carbon-fire wings before in other stunts, staging a series of aerial displays that send them across the skies.

Last year, Reffet and fellow Frenchman Fred Fugen also flew through the famed “Heaven’s Gate” archway in the mountains of China’s Hunan province.

The figures, which come from the National Observatory of Delinquency and Criminal Responses (ONDRP), claim that between 2015 and 2017 there were around 44,000 victims of knife crime each year, or an average of 120 per day.

On average, 118,000 people in France say they were victims of some sort of violent crime involving an attacker who they were not living with such as assaults in public areas, schools, nightclubs, and other venues, Le Figaro reports.

Knives are the most common weapons reported in violent crime cases, followed by 34 per cent who say they were attacked with a blunt object or rock, and around nine per cent who were attacked with a firearm.

In cases of fatal violence, the trend remains largely the same, with edged weapons seen in 34 per cent of cases, followed by firearms at 28 per cent.

221,Delingpole: Britain’s Floods Have Nothing to Do With Climate Change,['James Delingpole'],"Boris Johnson’s Greenest Government Evah has come up with a brilliant new excuse to duck its responsibilities for all the floods now swamping parts of Britain: climate change ate our homework.

From Hereford to Shrewsbury and South Wales to North Yorkshire, swathes of Britain are underwater thanks to flooding in the aftermath of Storm Dennis, which so far has claimed five lives. There are currently more than 400 flood warnings around Britain, with more heavy rain forecast to come.

But the government has effectively absolved itself of responsibility by pinning the blame on ‘climate change.’

Environment Secretary George ‘Useless’ Eustice has said in an interview with LBC radio that the scale of the flooding is due to the ‘nature of climate change’.

Sir James Bevan, the chief executive of the Environment Agency, has gone a step further by blaming ‘the climate emergency.’

None of this is true. There is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that these floods are anything other than an entirely normal, cyclical event which has been repeated many times over many centuries — with or without the contribution of anthropogenic CO2.

However the only grown-ups in government making this point are the kind of old school Conservatives with absolutely no chance of promotion in Boris’s new, green-obsessed regime of eco virtue-signalling cant.

One is former Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, whose Shropshire North constituency is among those most severely flooded.

He said:

“It has always rained in the UK in winter. The trick is to get it to go down again. You have to manage the countryside and manage the rivers. It is a complete cop-out to blame it all on climate change.”

Paterson also happens to be the last Environment Secretary to have understood that flooding is, in part, a man-made disaster – the result not of ‘climate change’ but of terrible, European-Union-driven environmental policy.

Here is what I wrote the last time there was a major flooding crisis which, again, the fake-Conservative government of the time – along with sundry eco-loons such as Bill McKibben – attempted to pin on climate change.

British rivers have always been prone to flooding because Britain is a kingdom of rains (where royalty comes in gangs). But traditionally, those living in flood-threatened areas have been able to mitigate the problem by making sure that their rivers are well dredged – and thus able to flow freely. […] So what changed? EU Regulation, that’s what. Thanks to the European Water Framework Directive – which passed into UK law in 2000 and which is enforced by the Environment Agency – the emphasis has shifted from preventing flooding to encouraging it. Yes, you read that right. Under EU legislation, dredging rivers is considered environmentally unfriendly because it takes them away from their “undisturbed”, “natural” state.

You can see why this EU-driven laissez-faire policy might appeal to government ministers: doing nothing — and being able to blame EU policy — is much cheaper than doing something.

But now Britain has left the EU, it has no excuse. Any Conservative government worth the name ought to be doing what Conservative governments are supposed to do best: seizing the initiative, taking the bull by the horns, doing what is practical and right and sanctioned by evidence, custom and time.

What the evidence shows is that dredging works. One of the areas hardest hit by the floods of six years ago was the Somerset Levels. The problem, it emerged, was lack of dredging and poor maintenance. This was remedied thanks to the intervention of then Environment Secretary Owen Paterson — who was subsequently sacked by Prime Minister David Cameron for being insufficiently on message with the government’s green agenda.

Ironically, as Paul Homewood points out, the flood-prone Somerset Levels are now one of the few regions that have escaped the worst of this year’s floods.

In a piece headlined No Flooding In Somerset Levels, Thanks to Owen Paterson Homewood notes that there is ‘only one red flood warning on the Somerset levels, despite the pummelling Storm Dennis. In general terms, however, the Somerset Levels are free of floods. A reminder that dredging and other maintenance work can be effective in preventing flooding, providing it is properly coordinated.’

I wonder what my late friend Christopher Booker would make of all this. He reported regularly on the absurdities of EU-driven environmental policy which was unnecessarily exacerbated Britain’s flooding problem.

While I’m sure he would have applauded the piece in his old paper the Telegraph by Jamie Blackett headlined ‘Defeatist officials need to stop hiding behind climate change and take action on floods’, I think he would have been more disheartened by the commentary written on the subject by the paper’s new Environment Editor Emma Gatten.

Her opening paragraph reads:

“Climate change is making the storms hitting Britain more extreme and we are not adequately prepared for what is coming our way.”

But what do you expect when her go-to source of expertise is none other than the discredited and ridiculous Lord Deben, chairman of the Climate Change Committee, who — despite his discreditedness and ridiculousness — has a profound influence on current government policy?

Climate change is not making the storms hitting Britain more extreme: this is pure nonsense.

Nor is there any evidence that the current floods are in any way abnormal or unprecedented.

Homewood again has a good summary of this, including records of floods in the Calder Valley:

There is a useful website, Eye on Calderdale, which has a detailed list of historical floods in the Valley, back to 1615: https://eyeoncalderdale.com/history-of-flooding-in-calderdale Naturally, some of the earlier events were never documented, but a quick count reveals 22 floods in Calder Valley between 1830 and 1895. Dozens more are listed in the 20thC. Most are what we would regard as “serious”.

There is also a timely report from the Global Warming Policy Forum, pointing out that if even a fraction of the tens of billions the government has spent since 2017 on subsidising renewable electricity had instead been spent on flood defences, Britain would now be a lot more resilient in the face of this latest weather event.

Time for the Govt to get its act together and rebalance its foolish climate policy. People will have to get much more angry, though, before @BorisJohnson is likely to listen. https://t.co/6yAlYexjLB — GWPF (@thegwpfcom) February 18, 2020

The GWPF’s director Benny Peiser writes:

The UK obviously has the balance of adaptation and mitigation very badly wrong. As a direct result of costly and ineffective climate change mitigation policies the country has underinvested in adaptation measures. These measures are very effective and “no regrets” policies because they yield dividends immediately and protect citizens against flooding and other natural disasters whether they are related to climate change or not. All political parties must take a share of the blame for this costly failure. It should be noted, however, that the fixation with climate change mitigation via renewable energy is largely the result of decisions taken by the European Union. That can now change. The opportunity of rebalancing UK climate policy is one of the most significant Brexit dividends and should be seized without delay.

222,"Left-Wing Think Tanks, Campaign Groups Dominate Media Landscape",['Victoria Friedman'],"Analysis by a media monitoring body has found that leftist groups which advocate for higher public spending appear more often in the media that right-wing groups that support less spending of taxpayers’ money.

The research conducted for one week in August and commissioned by Westminster-focussed news website Guido Fawkes found that statist organisations — such as think tanks, campaign groups, and charities — are mentioned six times more frequently in the British media that their free-market counterparts.

“In absolute terms, groups which advocate lower government spending receive less media attention than those which advocate greater government spending,” the report, published on Tuesday, said.

The study found that groups backing less public spending comprised of fewer than one-in-ten (three) of all groups receiving media attention, while organisations backing greater public spending were around half (18) of the total (44). Statist groups had reportedly received around 40 times more funding than free-market groups.

Some of the leftist groups whose views were given airtime include Extinction Rebellion, the socialist Fabian Society, Greenpeace, and the race equality think tank the Runnymede Trust, the later whose first director was Marxist scholar Dipak Nandy, the father of Labour leadership candidate Lisa Nandy.

BBC a ‘Secular Church’ That ‘Preaches’ on Climate Change, Against Brexit: Guest Editor https://t.co/DM3VdFl8ld — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 29, 2019

While this report examines the media landscape entire, other studies have pointed to bias in the BBC specifically. In 2018, think tank Civitas found that the BBC had suppressed Eurosceptic voices on its flagship current affairs radio programme, Today, in the decade to 2015. The report had revealed that of the 4,275 guests discussing EU matters only 132 — 3.2 per cent — backed leaving the bloc.

Analysis in 2017 by news monitoring group News-Watch found that in the crucial week in which the UK triggered Article 50 — the legal mechanism for leaving the EU — the Today programme was “strongly biased against Brexit”.

The liberal-progressive broadcaster has been otherwise accused of bias, with a poll published in December showed that nearly two-thirds (64 per cent) of Britons thought that the BBC was biased. Leading up to the general election, most Britons (48 per cent) responded in a poll that they did not trust BBC journalists to tell the truth, with one-in-five saying they did not trust the broadcaster “at all”.

Questions of impartiality are weighing upon the debate of the BBC’s future, with the government considering de-criminalising non-payment of the licence fee. Factions within Number 10, led by the prime minister’s senior adviser Dominic Cummings, want to see the licence fee scrapped. Former minister Robert Halfon has said that the fate of the broadcaster should be handed back to the people in a referendum.",https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/02/18/left-wing-groups-massively-over-represented-in-media-landscape-study/
223,"Boris Huawei Row with Trump Intensifies, Australia MPs Cancel UK Visit",['Jack Montgomery'],"Boris Johnson’s row with U.S. President Trump and other key allies over Huawei has intensified, with Australian MPs cancelling a trip to Britain amid rising tensions.

Prime Minister Johnson’s decision to allow the Chinese tech giant to participate in the construction of Britain’s 5G infrastructure — at its “periphery” rather than its “core”, his administration insists — has caused a rift with allies who believe the company is in thrall to China’s ruling Communist Party and represents a significant security risk.

Richard Grenell, the President’s no-nonsense ambassador to Germany, tweeted that President Trump had “called me from Air Force One and instructed me to make clear that any nation who choose to use an untrustworthy 5G vendor will jeopardise our ability to share intelligence and information at the highest level”.

Ambassador Grenell’s message was also a clear warning to Germany, which is also mulling Chinese involvement in 5G infrastructure — and insisted it was not bullying but right and proper for the United States to make it clear it would not share intelligence to the same extent with allies it believes are compromised.

Responding to criticism from Germany’s Die Linke (The Left) party, Grenell said it was unreasonable to expect U.S. intelligence-sharing to “continue as usual even when you make dangerous mistakes.”

We get to have our own policy too. Don’t assume we don’t get to react to your policy,” he warned.

“I find it offensive that you think the U.S. co-operation must stay the same no matter what you do. We call that taking us for granted.”

It’s odd that you don’t think about European solutions. Do you take any responsibility or just blame the US? https://t.co/HwuiQ3vO2h — Richard Grenell (@RichardGrenell) February 17, 2020

Britain’s membership of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network which encompasses the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada is arguably its most important security alliance — and it is not just the Americans who believe Johnson’s entanglement with Huawei may turn the British into a liability.

Parliamentarians from the former British colony’s intelligence and security committee cancelled a trip to Britain, following a row over leaked details of a meeting between the British foreign secretary and his Australian counterpart over Huawei.

“How would you feel if the Russians laid down infrastructure in your own networks? That’s how we feel about Huawei,” the Australians had warned, taking the side of the U.S. administration.

224,Man Stabs Two Christian Worshipers in Moscow Church,['Thomas D. Williams'],"A 26-year-old man entered a Moscow church during services on Sunday and stabbed two people before being restrained by members of the congregation, Russian media reported.

Police arrested the attacker, Efim Efimov, from the Lipetsk region south of Moscow, who allegedly carried out the assault in the Russian Orthodox church of Saint Nicholas, in central Moscow.

For the moment police are not calling the incident a terrorist attack, media revealed.

The motives behind the attack are still unclear but Efimov, who is a welder by profession and worked in construction on a rotational basis in Moscow, told human rights workers that he “freaked out” and that “there were many problems.”

According to a statement by Irina Volk, spokesperson for the Ministry of the Interior, “police arrested a 26-year-old man from the Lipetsk region who entered a church on Bakuninskaya Street on the morning of February 16 and injured two people with a knife.”

According to one eyewitness, “the man burst into the church during the service with a knife and attacked the parishioners near the altar.”

Archpriest Kirill Sladkov, the parish priest of Saint Nicholas church and head of the youth department of the Moscow city diocese, said the attacker was wearing glasses, rubber gloves, a hood, and appeared to be listening to music with headphones when he entered the church.

“We went to him to find out what was going on and to get him out calmly,” the priest told Russian television. “At that moment, he took out a knife and stabbed my assistant. After that, all my assistants who were present tried to detain him and he stabbed another of my colleagues twice.”

Police have reportedly arrested another six persons from the Lipetsk region for possible connections to the incident, while investigators are also inquiring into the attacker’s mental balance.

The church of Saint Nicholas, which dates back to the 16th century, was converted into a pastry shop during the Stalin era and underwent serious deterioration. In 1992 it was returned to the Orthodox Church but the liturgical services did not return until 1995.

The two injured members of the faithful, named Andrey and Valery, have been released from the hospital and are back home, Rev. Sladkov posted on Instagram.

225,"Boris Soft on Scrapping TV Tax, Seeks BBC 'Reform' Instead: Report",['Victoria Friedman'],"Prime Minister Boris Johnson is reportedly backing the softer option of “reforming” the BBC, putting him at odds with his senior advisor, the conservative revolutionary Dominic Cummings, who is leading the charge for scrapping the mandatory TV tax in favour of a consumer-based subscription.

An ally of Mr Johnson told The Times that “the PM is not as gung ho on the licence fee as Dom,” adding: “With Dom it’s ideological — he believes the licence fee should be scrapped. With the PM it’s more reform than revolution.”

A Downing Street spokesman denied that there was a split in Number 10 and that current talks surrounding the BBC were focused on decriminalising the non-payment of the licence fee, which can currently result in up to a £1,000 fine, court attendance, and even imprisonment. In 2018, there were 121,000 convictions for licence fee evasion in England and Wales, with five people going to prison.

However, sources had revealed over the weekend that Boris’s government wants to scrap the licence fee, making the BBC earn its own money such as through a subscription service. A spokesman from Downing Street further backed off from the reported proposal, telling the i newspaper: “I would point you to what the Prime Minister has said on this before, which was, ‘At this stage we are not planning to get rid of all licence fees though I am certainly looking at it.'”

It is certain that the BBC cannot survive in its current form, with broadcasting watchdog Ofcom warning as much in October 2019 that with young viewers tuning out of the BBC, it will become increasingly difficult in coming years to justify the TV licence, which is mandatory for anyone watching live television whether they consume BBC material or not.

This month, culture secretary Nicky Morgan said that the BBC could go the way of video and DVD rental outlet Blockbuster unless it evolves. On Monday, a report revealed that nearly 200,000 households had cancelled their TV licence in one year.

Former minister Robert Halfon MP has called for the question of how to fund the BBC to be sent back to the people, suggesting there should be a referendum on the future of the BBC, with the broadcaster’s charter set for renewal in 2027.

Mr Halfon said in comments reported by The Telegraph: “They say that we own the BBC but we have no role in it. This would be about a democratisation of the BBC. To coin a phrase, it’s time for viewers to take back control.”

The Education Committee chairman added that it was “absurd” to “put someone in prison because they haven’t paid a compulsory tax to watch TV”.

While reforming the BBC or scrapping the TV tax was not a core element of the Conservative Party’s December 2019 election manifesto, Mr Johnson raised the matter on the campaign trail using similar terms to Mr Halfon’s, saying: “How long can you justify a system whereby everybody who has a TV has to pay to fund a particular set of channels?”

Johnson’s apparent softening towards overhauling the broadcaster, which is increasingly accused of bias, appears to be another sign of the prime minister’s weakening on core conservative issues. In recent months, Johnson has announced massive public spending on the unpopular HS2 highspeed rail link; signed up Chinese firm Huawei to help build the country’s 5G network despite security concerns both within government and the Five Eyes; and made the Tories the party of climate change action.",https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/02/18/boris-soft-scrapping-tv-tax-seeks-bbc-reform-instead-report/
226,UK Confidence in Household Finances Hits Highest Since 2009,['Victoria Friedman'],"Britons are feeling the most optimistic in their domestic financial wellbeing for 11 years, in the latest sign of confidence since Boris Johnson won the election and the UK left the EU.

IHS Markit Household Finance Index, which measures a household’s perception of financial health, rose from 44.6 in January to 47.6 in February, the highest since IHS Market started to record the data in 2009.

The Future Household Finance Index, which measures the expected change in a household’s fiscal wellbeing over the coming year, tipped over the 50.0 mark from 49.6 last month to 52.7 this month, according to The Guardian. That figure surpassed the last peak in January 2015.

IHM Markit, a London-based global information provider, also found in its survey that households had lower pessimism about job security this month, with expectations on the cost of living also improving.

Mark Futcher, the head of workplace wealth at investment consultancy group Barnett Waddingham, said in comments reported by City A.M.: “It’s a breath of fresh air to see financial wellbeing at survey-record high. In the post-election and post-Brexit environment, people are standing on steadier ground for their financial future.”

The feel-good factor comes after Britain registered record levels of economic and employment prosperity since the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016.

In November, the UK economy counted 13 quarters of growth since the Brexit referendum, outperforming the eurozone as a whole and Germany –the EU’s largest economy — in particular.

‘Biggest Cash Increase Ever’ as Government Set to Raise Minimum Wage in April https://t.co/l1c5E66sf0 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 3, 2020

While in mid-December — after the Conservatives won an 80-seat majority — the UK reported record jobs numbers, with 76.2 per cent of the population employed. That record was bested in January, with 76.3 per cent employed, while the unemployment rate held its recorded low of 3.8 per cent, its lowest rate since 1975, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Employment minister Mims Davies said last month: “This, coupled with business confidence turning a corner, is paving the way for an even stronger jobs market in 2020.”

The government also revealed in early January that it was set to increase the national living wage (the term used to describe the national minimum wage for workers aged 25 and over), in what the government described at “the biggest cash increase ever”. It is set to rise by 6.2 per cent — four times the rate of inflation — in April to £8.72 an hour.

“Our people’s pay rise will put more money into the pockets of millions of hard-working Brits across the country – but we won’t stop there. We want to make the UK the first country in the world to eliminate low pay in the next five years,” Andrea Leadsom, the then-Secretary of State for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy, had said.",https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/02/18/uk-confidence-household-finances-hits-highest-since-2009/

Around 60 to 89 per cent of the children attending the six preschools speak another language as their mother tongue with the Skogsgläntans preschool seeing the majority of children speaking Arabic, fueling fears of segregation in the municipality.

Monica Berggren, the rector of Skogsgläntans preschool, said that language issues can be a problem when conflicts arise, while teacher Camilla Widerström added that it was difficult for teachers to understand the children or have the children understand them, Sveriges Radio reports.

The manager of preschools in the municipality Ingela Berg added that the preschools are largely in areas that have seen high numbers of newly arrived immigrants.

The Arabic language has seen a surge in popularity in Sweden in recent years in the wake of the 2015 migrant crisis, with Arabic language courses becoming more popular in the country than English or French courses in 2018.

228,Empire State Manufacturing Survey Unexpectedly Jumps to Highest Level in 9 Months,['John Carney'],"Factory activity in New York picked up in February, with new orders, inventories, and prices all increasing.

The business conditions index of the Empire State Manufacturing Survey, put out by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, jumped 8.1 points from January’s reading to 12.9.

That is the highest reading since May of last year and above the consensus forecast of between 4.0 and 4.5. It is also the second consecutive monthly “beat” for this gauge, indicating the manufacturing activity in the State of New York is experiencing a much stronger than expected recovery from the doldrums of last year.

The New York Fed’s gauge of manufacturing activity declined sharply at the end of 2018 as global demand waned due to sluggish economic conditions around the world slower growth in the U.S. It took a second dive in May of last year, briefly turning negative and indicating contraction, and then remained at low but still positive levels for the rest of the year.

The survey’s measures of new orders, unfilled orders, shipments, delivery time, inventories and prices received all increased, painting a picture of healthy demand and business confidence.

The gauge of prices paid declined, indicating very little inflationary pressure. The measure for the number of employees also fell but remained positive, suggesting that employment growth continues despite unemployment in New York falling to the lowest level in over thirty years and remaining at that ultra-low level for six months.

The average employee workweek fell to a reading of negative one, which is a bit of an outlier considering the strength elsewhere in the survey.

The index looking at expected general business conditions six months ahead dipped a bit after January’s very strong reading. In fact, all but one of the indicators looking six months ahead came in lower. Notably, expectations for prices paid and prices received were lower, which could complicate the Federal Reserve’s attempt to raise inflation to its two percent target. Expectations for payroll growth grew, implying that businesses expect to be able to keep filling positions despite the ultralow employment level.",https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/02/18/empire-state-manufacturing-survey-unexpectedly-jumps-to-highest-level-in-9-months/

Under a chyron that reads “TRUMP TAKES CREDIT FOR OBAMA’S ECONOMY,” Scarborough hit the media for “parroting what Donald Trump says” about the economy. He then credited Obama for the economy’s recovery, saying it “began 11 years ago.”

“The media runs around all the time, and they have been doing it for years talking about, parroting what Donald Trump says about how great the economy has been. Well, yes, this is a recovery that began 11 years ago,” Scarborough outlined. “And if you want to just look at growth, economic growth, you know, because Donald Trump is promising four, five, six percent in terms of economic growth and GDP, you look at the last 10 presidents and their GDP growth throughout their administrations, six in 10 of those presidents, according to Axios yesterday and well, just according to government statistics, actually had stronger economies than Donald Trump. … [W]hich means that once again, Donald Trump is in the bottom half of his class.

230,"Mastercard Wants to Identify You by Your Heartbeat, Veins",['Tom Ciccotta'],"Payment provider Mastercard announced this week that it is developing various technologies that will allow it to identify customers by their strides, heartbeat, and vein patterns.

According to a report by MarketWatch, Mastercard is developing biometric technology that will allow the payment provider and other companies to identify their customers based on unusual biometrics. The new technology will specifically allow Mastercard to identify customers based on the way that they walk, the unique pattern of their heartbeat, and the layout of their veins.

Ajay Bhalla, president of cyber and intelligence solutions for Mastercard, said in a short comment that the company is eager to track their user’s unique biometric data. To Mastercard, these metrics are the next evolution beyond the fingerprint scanners that have become common in smartphones.

“The way you hold your phone, which ear you use, and how your fingers touch the buttons are all unique to you,” Bhalla said. “We have been testing heartbeat, vein technology, and the way people walk to authenticate people.”

Mastercard is also looking into vascular matching technology, which identifies individuals based on the vein pattern that is identifiable on their skin. “We are looking closely at a range of modalities for biometric authentication, including gait analysis, ECG [electrocardiogram] and vein pattern to identify a user,” a MasterCard spokesman said.

Bhalla said that the credit card giant also wants to use heartbeat monitoring to identify their customers. “A user could wear a band around their wrist that measures the pulse and constantly authenticates you.”

The usage of biometrics is controversial both by governments and private companies. Facebook recently settled an Illinois lawsuit for $550 million on the topic of biometrics. According to Breitbart News’ reporting on the lawsuit:

The lawsuit began in 2015 when Facebook users from Illinois alleged that the site violated the state’s Biometric Information Privacy Act by using facial recognition software to analyze users’ photos. The lawsuit specifically related to Facebook’s “Tag Suggestions” feature which allowed users to recognize their Facebook friends from uploaded photos.

231,Kent State ‘Gun Girl’ Kaitlin Bennett Confronted by Protest Mob at Ohio University,['Tom Ciccotta'],"Kent State “gun girl” Kaitlin Bennett was confronted by a mob of protesters during her visit to Ohio University on Monday. According to the university, “She drew a large crowd of people, many with opposing viewpoints, who also chose to exercise their first amendment rights.”

According to a report by USA Today, conservative activist Kaitlin Bennett was mobbed by a group of students during a visit this week to Ohio Univerity. Bennett is perhaps best known for posing with a gun for graduation photos in 2018. Since then, Bennett has traveled to campuses around the country to discuss hot-button issues with progressive college students.

Bennett posted a video of her encounter with the Ohio University mob to her Twitter account on Monday. In the video, hundreds of students circle around Bennett as she tries to make her way through campus in a car driven by a black student. At one point, the video shows a member of the mob splashing the vehicle’s occupants with liquid.

At one point during her visit, Bennett announced that she would encourage President Trump to strip federal funding from universities that don’t protect students from outrage mobs.

“This is what happens when a Trump supporter goes to a college campus,” Bennett said during the video. “I think @realDonaldTrump should strip funding from universities like this that harbor terrorists.”

This is what happens when a Trump supporter goes to a college campus. Leftists at @ohiou started a riot when @Joelpatrick1776 and I showed up, and the @oupolice let it happen.

Another video appears to show the mob action before Bennett reached the vehicle:

The @oupolice lied and said that no violence happened and that there were just ""allegations that some unknown person splashed water."" Students at @ohiou were throwing things at me all day, dumped hot coffee on me, & vandalized @Joelpatrick1776's truck right in front of the cops. pic.twitter.com/XnMUqFWtrH — Kaitlin Bennett (@KaitMarieox) February 18, 2020

The Ohio University Police Department released a statement on Monday about Bennett’s visit to campus. The department claimed that they closely monitored Bennett’s visit to ensure that the rights of all students were protected.

Early this afternoon an activist appeared unexpectedly on the Ohio University campus in Athens and engaged in Constitutionally protected activity. She drew a large crowd of people, many with opposing viewpoints, who also chose to exercise their first amendment rights. Ohio University police officers were present throughout the incident to protect everyone’s rights and safety; other than keeping streets and other public rights of way clear, no police officers asked anyone to leave at any point in time. Contrary to allegations circulating on social media, the incident did not rise to the level of a riot. There was strong language, and allegations that some unknown person(s) in the crowd splashed water, but there were no reported injuries or violence, and no one was arrested during the event. It should be noted that the police department received no prior notice of the activist’s plans. Although such notice is not required, the lack of it deprived the department of the ability to plan staffing levels. As a result, the officers on duty had to prioritize their response to the events as they unfolded, rightly putting everyone’s personal safety ahead of all other concerns.

Conservatives have been quick to question the police’s handling of the incident, including Jack Posobiec

“We’re sick and tired of waiting for the government to regulate Facebook,” said Tracy Rosenberg, one of the protest’s organizers. “You’re profiting off of us — you’re selling our information.”

While the protesters carried signage that stated, “Stop the Lies, Protect our democracy” and “break up Facebook,” chants of “Wake up, Zuck” and “fake news, real hate” could be heard.

Certain individuals from the group made their mark directly in front of Zuckerberg’s home by using chalk to write phrases including “Facebook is a Russian asset”; “don’t sell my private data”; and “history will write your epitaph as the man who broke democracy.”

Some of the people who took part in the protest feel that Facebook is a “threat” to “democratic systems around the world.”

Ted Lewis, an activist with Global Exchange said:

We like many others and the organizations that put this rally together feel that Facebook is a dramatic threat to our democratic systems around the world. Facebook needs to take responsibility for what they’re doing — they need to get the lies off of their platform.

Lewis also expressed his concern over Facebook’s inaction to step in and censor certain political ads.

“Political advertising could contain the most blatant falsehood and they refuse to do anything about it,” Lewis claimed.

Another protester insisted Facebook is “monetizing propaganda.”

“You can say anything you want,” said Erin Fisher, a Campaign to Regulate and Break Up Big Tech activist. “Facebook is the most important. They’re monetizing propaganda.”

Over the weekend, while attending the Munich Security Conference in Germany, Zuckerberg made the point that individual expression and free speech could be stifled by Facebook’s online control of speech.

Zuckerberg also made it clear that he supports government regulation of speech online.

He said, “We don’t want private companies making so many decisions about how to balance social equities without any more democratic process.”

For months, the left has attempted to pressure Facebook into fact-checking and censoring certain political advertisements.

235,Human-Rights-Abusing-Chinese-Surveillance-Company-Promoted-by-UK,['Kurt Zindulka'],"The United Kingdom will promote a Chinese tech firm that is responsible for the mass security apparatus used to surveil minority groups in the western region of Xinjiang, China.

Following recent spats with the United States over Chinese involvement in the UK, Hikvision, a Chinese surveillance company, has been permitted by the Home Office to attend next month’s Security and Policing trade fair in Farnborough, England. The move flies in the face of judgements made by British allies, including the United States which blacklisted Hikvision in October for its human rights violations in China.

The fair will be held between March 3-5, hosted by the Home Office, who said the event will be used to strengthen “our strong security alliances around the world and for our international partners to understand and hear about the work we are doing to keep our country secure,” according to The Guardian.

Analysis reported by the newspaper found that nine of the 300 companies invited to the event have been accused of human rights abuses, including Hikvision.

Conservative MP Bob Seely urged the Home Office to rescind the invitation, saying: “We need to stop having an ethical bypass when it comes to China and hi-tech. If we are going to proclaim UK values and standards, we need at least the appearance of consistency.”

The move to invite Hikvision could increase the tension between the United States and the United Kingdom, which has recently become strained following Boris Johnson’s decision to allow Huawei to help build parts of the UK’s 5G network, a decision that was heavily criticised by the United States and other allies including Australia.

Hikvision was blacklisted by the United States Department of Commerce, alongside 28 other Chinese firms in October of last year, saying the company is “implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China’s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups” in Xinjiang province, sometimes referred to as Sinkiang or East Turkestan.

The company is one of the largest surveillance equipment firms in the world, valued at approximately $42 billion. In 2017 it was awarded at least five security contracts worth an estimated 1.85 billion yuan ($260 million) to install a “social prevention and control system” in Xinjiang comprising of tens of thousands of cameras.

A leaked document released by Deutsche Welles on Monday showed that China is using hi-tech surveillance equipment to monitor every move made by Uyghur people in the region. The document detailed 311 people who were detained for “reeducation” for committing offences such as growing a beard, fasting or applying for a passport.

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has interned between one and three million Uyghur Muslim people in the western region of Xinjiang. China has long been accused by former prisoners of using torture, rape, forced sterilisation, and organ harvesting against minority peoples interned in the camps.

In an exclusive Breitbart London video, one Uyghur woman described the conditions in the camps, saying: “torture, lack of food, no hygiene, and people are forced to take unknown medicines, women are forced to be sterilised. There are women who have been there for over one year, they said they didn’t have periods, young women, because they are forced to take some unknown medication.”

“Widespread rape has been reported, naked searches every other day, so the women have to be stripped naked and they have to sit up in front of many officials… and that is very humiliating, it’s against the complete humanity in this 21st century [sic]” she added.

Google case, contending that Google illegally copied thousands of Oracle’s Java copyrighted code. IAP senior fellow Rachel Bovard told Breitbart News that this instance serves as a “poster child” for Google’s anticompetitive practices.

Oracle filed a brief with the Supreme Court last week, contending that Google stole thousands of lines of copyrighted code and diminished Oracle’s chances of competing in the smartphone marketplace. The brief asked the nation’s highest court to preserve an appellate court ruling that found that Google had infringed on Oracle’s copyrighted Java application program interface (API) copyrighted material to build Google’s Android smartphone operating system.

Oracle wrote in its brief that Google “committed an egregious act of plagiarism and now needs to rewrite copyright law to justify it.” Oracle said that Google had illegally copied 11,330 lines of copyrighted code, which led to Google’s Android becoming a dominant smartphone operating system.

Dorian Daley, the Oracle general counsel, said in a statement, “While Google would prefer to live in a world unencumbered by intellectual property rights, in the real world, copyrights are an essential protection and incentive for innovation.” Daley called Google’s actions an “egregious act of plagiarism.”

Bovard told Breitbart News in an interview Monday that Google’s alleged theft of copyrighted Java source code serves as another instance of Google’s anticompetitive behavior.

“This is not a unique issue, and that’s why it’s so important to pay attention to because this is a pattern of behavior for Google. It’s not only what they’ve done for Oracle and others, and the only difference right now is that Oracle has the resources to fight back,” Bovard said.

Bovard cited another instance of Google’s anticompetitive behavior; speaker company Sonos sued Google, believing that the search giant had stolen its smart speaker technology to make its own Google-branded speaker system.

Bovard noted that Google initially opted to attempt to license Oracle’s Java API, but then relented after Oracle’s compatibility requirements conflicted with what the search giant wanted to do with Android.

“The most damning thing with Google is that they recognize that this wasn’t fair use. They were trying to license this from Oracle because they knew it wasn’t fair use; it had a commercial value,” she said.

Lyrics media website Genius also accused Google of stealing its content.

“Sonos is suing Google for a similar issue, and if not Google, big tech has this problem. … It’s also Amazon and others that follow Google’s pattern, and the Google Oracle lawsuit is the poster child for it. But Google certainly is not unique,” she added.

The IAP brief noted that Google’s solution for its use of copyrighted Java code would “radically” expand the scope of the “fair use” doctrine. The fair use doctrine allows businesses to use copyrighted material under limited circumstances. IAP noted that this expansion would “deter” investments from new firms that would want to build their own APIs, as other firms could then use their code under the expanded fair use doctrine. The conservative tech group noted that Microsoft and Apple designed their own APIs instead of licensing the Oracle platform.

“Thus, Apple and Microsoft would be competitively disadvantaged by their decision to innovate rather than imitate — precisely the opposite incentive that copyright law is designed to protect,” the IAP brief noted.

Bovard said that if the Supreme Court would rule in favor of Oracle, it would improve competition in the technology markets.

Bovard said that Google steals other businesses’ ideas and “then they go out of business. This is not what a free market looks like. That’s why this is so important to talk about it. If they’re [Google] slapped on the wrist in this case, then we’ll actually be able to see more of a market emerge in tech. It’s going to be a big deal whichever way it goes,” Bovard said.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/18/rachel-bovard-oracle-case-poster-child-for-googles-anticompetitive-behavior/
237,Samsung Positioned to Profit from Apple’s Coronavirus Production Woes,['Lucas Nolan'],"A recent report claims that Samsung Electronics could benefit massively from Apple’s manufacturing problems in China caused by the coronavirus spreading throughout the country. Apple’s iPhone production relies heavily on China, while Samsung has distributed its production facilities throughout Asia.

Reuters reports that Samsung Electronics stands to benefit from the production problems in China caused by the outbreak of the Coronavirus which is plagueing company’s such as Apple. This is due to the fact that Samsung has taken advantage of low-cost smartphone manufacturing in Vietnam, where the virus has had a limited effect on production.

Half of Samsung’s smartphones are manufactured in Vietnam which has been relatively unaffected by the Coronavirus. Apple stated this week that it would not meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter as a result of production issues and sales in China where most iPhones are made. Chinese tech firm Xiaomi Corp also stated last week that its March quarter sales were being affected by the virus.

Another major Samsung rival, Huawei, has not announced any production issues but Samsung insiders, analysts, and suppliers reportedly expect that the firm will also be affected due to its reliance on Chinese manufacturing. Many Chinese factories have reopened but shortages of workers and other production issues have kept output to a minimum.

An individual with knowledge of Samsung’ssupply chain told Reuters: “Samsung is better positioned to weather the virus fallout than its formidable rivals such as Huawei and Apple. The virus exposed China risks. We feel fortunate that we were able to escape the risks.”

Another individual with knowledge of the situation stated: “Samsung does not say it publicly. But it is relieved.” Samsung also recently launched a new smartphone delivery service for customers to test its new products as the spread of the Coronavirus has resulted in the cancelation of a number of promotional events and affected in-store sales.

238,UAE Grants License for Arab World’s First Nuclear Power Plant,['Breitbart Jerusalem'],"(UPI) — The Arab world’s first nuclear power plant received official approval Monday from regulators in the United Arab Emirates.

The UAE’s Federal Authority for Nuclear Regulation (FANR) said it granted an operating license for the first of four planned reactors at the Barakah Nuclear Power Plant in Abu Dhabi. It’s the region’s first peaceful nuclear energy program.

Hamad al-Kaabi, the UAE representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency, called the decision to grant a 60-year operating license to the Nawah Energy Co. a “historical moment.”

“[Nawah] will undertake a period of commissioning to prepare for the commercial operation during which FANR will have around the clock inspection, using its resident inspectors at Barakah Nuclear Power Plant and deploying other inspectors,” al-Kaabi said.

Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Zayed also praised the approval, which completed a 12-year effort by Nawah to build and license the reactor. He tweeted that Monday’s occasion “marks a new chapter in our journey for the development of peaceful nuclear energy.”

“As we prepare for the next 50 years to safeguard our needs, our biggest strength is national talent,” he added.

The four reactors will have a total capacity of 5,600 megawatts — enough to provide about a quarter of UAE energy needs.

Al-Kaabi said the plant’s second unit is 95 percent completed, the third is 92 percent done and the fourth 83 percent.",https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/02/18/uae-grants-license-for-arab-worlds-first-nuclear-power-plant/
239,East Asian Travelers Banned from Israel over Coronavirus Fears,['Breitbart Jerusalem'],"The Times of Israel reports: As part of efforts to prevent the spread of the deadly coronavirus, Interior Minister Aryeh Deri on Monday said Israel would ban all non-Israelis who were in four East Asian countries and territories in the previous 14 days.

Until now, travelers coming from Thailand, Singapore, and the semi-autonomous Chinese cities of Hong Kong and Macau had to quarantine themselves for 14 days, under Health Ministry directives issued on Sunday. The new restrictions by Deri were advised by the Health Ministry, Hebrew media reported.

As a result, Hong Kong’s national airline Cathay Pacific is set to announce that it is suspending all its flights to Israel, multiple reports said, quoting officials in the company as saying its employees will not be able to enter the Jewish state under the new rules. The Foreign Ministry is reportedly concerned about diplomatic fallout from the ban.

240,Netanyahu Lauds Maiden Israeli Flight over Sudan Skies,['Deborah Danan'],"TEL AVIV – Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that an Israeli plane made a historic first flight over Sudan only two weeks after he met with the Arab state’s leader in Uganda.

“I’ve been developing contacts with the Arab countries and Muslim countries, and I can tell you there’s scarcely one, two, three Muslim or Arab countries around the world that we don’t have deepened ties with,” he said at the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations in Jerusalem.

Israel and Sudan, he said, are “discussing rapid normalization.” He noted that Sudan is “an Arab, or rather a Muslim country, speaking Arabic, that hosted the Khartoum Conference. And in Khartoum they have all the no’s against Israel. Remember the no’s? No recognition, no Israel basically.”

Earlier this month, Netanyahu met secretly in Entebbe, Uganda, with Sudanese leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan.

“It was agreed to start cooperation leading to normalization of the relationship between the two countries,” an Israeli statement said at the time.

Sudan and Israel are erstwhile enemies, with Khartoum being the backdrop to the infamous “Three No’s” issued by the Arab League during its summit in the Sudanese capital in 1967. Arab states at the time agreed that there would be “no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, and no negotiations with it.”

Until recently, Sudan was considered by Israel to be a security threat over Iran’s suspected use of the country to smuggle arms into the Gaza Strip. However, Khartoum has distanced itself from Iran over its involvement in Yemen and that, together with the ouster last year of country’s longtime ruler Omar al-Bashir, means that the threat no longer exists.

Netanyahu said Sunday’s flight over Sudan marked “quite a change” and cut about three hours of flight time to South America.

“I’m just telling you what is above the surface. How much is above the surface in an iceberg? It’s about 10 percent. What you’re seeing is about 10 percent. Vast changes are coming because Israel is now a power to contend with, and because collaboration with Israel helps you prepare, secure the future of your people and ensure a better future for your people,” he said.

The meeting between Netanyahu and al-Burhan came days after Sudan joined the Arab League in rejecting President Donald Trump’s recently unveiled Middle East peace plan.

The Palestinians slammed the meeting as a “stab in the back.”

“This meeting is a stab in the back of the Palestinian people and a stark departure from the Arab Peace Initiative at a time when the administration of President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu are trying to liquidate the Palestinian cause,” senior Palestinian official Saeb Erekat told the Palestinian Authority’s official news agency WAFA.",https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/02/18/netanyahu-lauds-maiden-israeli-flight-over-sudan-skies/
241,Pics: Satellite Images Show Massive Damage to Iranian Targets in Syria,['Deborah Danan'],"TEL AVIV – Several Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) sites in Syria have sustained massive damage or else have been destroyed entirely by airstrikes last week attributed to Israel, new images released Monday by satellite imagery firm ImageSat International (ISI) show.

The raids targeted, among other buildings and a headquarters, warehouses for storing weapons brought into Syria from Iran.

A hangar that ImageSat said was “probably used for storing ammunition or [surface-to-air missiles]” was also badly damaged.

Last Thursday night, airstrikes targeted five sites near Damascus International Airport, regional news reported.

According to flight data, the strike came on the heels of the arrival of a weapons shipment from Tehran.

Four IRGC members and three Syrian regime soldiers were killed, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

Israel was blamed for the strike, with Syrian state-run media saying air defenses had intercepted “hostile targets.”

243,Talk Show Host Wendy Williams Blasted for Mocking Amie Harwick’s Death,['Warner Todd Huston'],"TV talk show host Wendy Williams is in hot water for appearing to make light of the gruesome death of Hollywood sex therapist Amie Harwick.

Wendy Williams, who had only recently dug herself out of accusations that she smeared gay men, brought up Harwick’s death on her Monday broadcast noting that Harwick was “pushed off a third-floor balcony.” Williams then snakily said “come on down,” while looking up and then down as if something was falling, referencing the famous phrase heard on The Price is Right, the game show hosted by Harwick’s ex-fiance Drew Carey.

The joking about the woman’s murder shocked many who thought Williams was being horribly insensitive.

Harwick was allegedly killed on Saturday from the fall from her third-floor apartment. Police arrested the woman’s ex-boyfriend, Gareth Pursehouse, and charged him with her murder.

Twitter users were shocked at Williams for her seeming indifference to the woman’s death.

One Twitter user, for instance, felt Williams was stone-cold:

244,Jury to Begin Deliberating in Harvey Weinstein’s Rape Trial,['Breitbart News'],"NEW YORK (AP) — A jury is expected to begin deliberations Tuesday in Harvey Weinstein’s rape trial after often-emotional testimony from multiple women who accused him of sexual assault.

The panel of five women and seven men will begin to weigh the evidence that Weinstein raped a woman in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and forcibly performed oral sex on another woman, TV and film production assistant Mimi Haleyi, in 2006.

Other accusers including actress Annabella Sciorra testified as part of the prosecution’s effort to show he used the same tactics to victimize many women over the years.

Weinstein, 67, maintains any sexual conduct was consensual.

Haleyi, a former “Project Runway” production assistant, testified that Weinstein pushed her onto a bed and sexually assaulted her, undeterred by her kicks and pleas of, “No, please don’t do this, I don’t want it.”

The woman who says Weinstein raped her in 2013 sobbed in court as she described how she sent Weinstein flattering emails and kept seeing him after the alleged rape because “I wanted him to believe I wasn’t a threat.”

The Associated Press has a policy of not publishing the names of people who allege sexual assault without their consent. It is withholding the name of the rape accuser because it isn’t clear whether she wishes to be identified publicly.

Prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said in her closing argument Friday that Weinstein treated the women who accused him like “complete disposables” and made them feel ashamed even though he was the one who was at fault.

“What he wants to do is he wants to get them in a situation where they feel stupid. If you feel stupid and belittled, belittled, stupid people do not complain,” the prosecutor told jurors.

But defense lawyer Donna Rotunno said in her closing argument last week that the prosecutors had “created a universe that strips adult women of common sense, autonomy and responsibility.”

Rotunno suggested that, according to prosecutors, Weinstein’s accusers “are not even responsible for sitting at their computers sending emails to someone across the country.”",https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2020/02/18/jury-to-begin-deliberating-in-harvey-weinsteins-rape-trial/
245,Nolte: Marvel’s ‘The Eternals’ Will Feature First Man-on-Man Gay Kiss,['John Nolte'],"Marvel is promoting its first man-on-man gay kiss, which will be featured in The Eternals, which hits theaters on November 20.

“On Thursday, actor Haaz Sleiman teased his upcoming on-screen kiss with costar Brian Tyree Henry, ” reports MSN. “It’s a beautiful, very moving kiss,” Sleiman said. “Everyone cried on set.”

“For me, it’s very important to show how loving and beautiful a queer family can be,” he added. “We forget that because we’re always depicted as sexual or rebellious; we forget to connect on that human part.”

The Eternals will also feature a deaf superhero.

No word yet on the one-legged Eskimo lesbian with a harelip, a marginalized minority group that remains under-represented in movies, television, literature, stage, and song.

The Eternals stars Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harrington, and Kumail Nanjiani, and is about superheroes who live underground and then emerge to save the world, or something.

Well, this should be interesting…

Over and over and over again, at about a 100 percent rate, we have seen woke blockbusters crash and burn at the box office, or at least under-perform. The anti-male Birds of Prey is just the latest victim of audiences rejecting agendas and lectures disguised as entertainment.

Incredibly, this list also includes the Star Wars saga, which most of us believed was bulletproof. I’m not arguing the latest Star Wars trilogy was a flop. But it did perform so far below expectations, especially The Rise of Skywalker, which should have out-performed pretty much every other Star Wars movie, that as a movie franchise, Star Wars is dead.

Can Marvel break the Woke Curse?

Can Marvel get away with using this guy-on-guy action as the tip of its promotional spear and not take a hit at the box office?

Well, if anyone can, it’s Marvel, a franchise with an unprecedented 100 percent hit-rate at the box office; something unheard of when you’re talking about 20-plus titles released over only a dozen or so years.

A few things, though, should concern Marvel…

Star Wars was once considered as bulletproof as Marvel.

Marvel is no longer Marvel. What I mean is that the Iron Man/Captain America era is over. Come on, who the hell are the Eternals?

Finally, who wants to see this? Who is the audience for this? Do parents want to expose their children to something that will result in a premature conversation about human sexuality?

For 99 percent of kids, watching a man and woman smooch is normal. They think nothing of it. But when kids see two hairy guys get it on, all of a sudden the topic of human sexuality is on the table, a conversation your children might not be ready for. After all, good parents seek to protect their child’s innocence for as long as possible.

I’m certainly not the audience — I can tell you that. I’m not going to spend 150 minutes and ten bucks to sit there and wait to be uncomfortable. Who wants to sit around all tensed up “waiting for it?”

Yeah, yeah, I know we’re not supposed to express those kinds of thoughts out loud today; we’re supposed to remain quiet, or worse, pretend that as a red-blooded heterosexuals we are not made uncomfortable when two hairy guys become romantically intimate. Sorry, but the fascist thought police cannot change the fact that we are indeed made uncomfortable. And…

That’s not homophobia… That’s human nature. What’s more, it is also my own – if you will — sexual preference, and why am I not allowed to express my own personal sexual preferences, which includes a desire to avoid watching two fellas neck?

And I tried. I swear I sat through all those 90’s indie movies… But this stuff has never failed to make me uncomfortable, and now I’m done trying because life is just too short.

Listen, as I have said before, it is totally appropriate for Hollywood to make movies for gay audiences. Hollywood should make movies for everyone, and if they want to make a $250 million superhero blockbuster for gay people… Fine.

I’m just not going to go see it.",https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2020/02/17/marvel-the-eternals-will-feature-first-man-on-man-gay-kiss/

He was selling a seat, and we did that story here … We talked about what a crook he was and how bad it was.

248,Cotton: ‘Fake News Media’ Angrier About Raising Coronavirus Questions Than at the Chinese Communist Party,['Jeff Poor'],"Tuesday on Hugh Hewitt’s nationally syndicated radio show, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) reacted to media outlets, including MSNBC, criticizing his proactive approach in taking on the threat of the Coronavirus.

The virus’ origins are from mainland China, and because of that, Cotton has insisted the Chinese government should be more transparent.

As Hewitt pointed out, those overtures have drawn backlash from not only the People’s Republic of China but MSNBC, as well.

“I have to say that the fake news media seems angrier at me for raising questions about the origins of the Coronavirus than they are at the Chinese Communist Party for contributing to this huge mess, to begin with,” Cotton said. “So from the very beginning, after China, remember, finally acknowledged that they had a problem in Wuhan, which they hid for many weeks, which would have, if we had known, would have allowed us to get further ahead of the virus. The Chinese Communist Party said it originated in a food market in Wuhan. Yet an authoritative study in the Lancet, the respected international science journal, by Chinese scientists, refuted that almost conclusively. Fourteen of the original 41 cases had no contact with that food market whatsoever.”

Cotton speculated the virus could be connected to China’s biosafety laboratory and slammed the Chinese Communist Party for a record of “dishonesty and incompetence.”

“So we still don’t know the origins of this Coronavirus,” he said. “And I have merely pointed out for several weeks now that China’s only biosafety level 4 laboratory dealing with human infectious diseases is just a few miles away from that laboratory. I don’t know where this virus originated. Natural causes somewhere other than that food market is still the most likely hypothesis.”

“But given the Chinese Community Party’s record of dishonesty and incompetence in managing this crisis, we at least have to ask the question whether or not it’s connected to that laboratory and demand that international scientists be admitted to study the evidence of both in the food market and the laboratory and in those original cases, especially the original 14 cases that had no contact with the food market if we want to get our hands around how this virus originated and what that can tell us about diagnosing it and trying to treat it,” Cotton added.

Protect Democracy is led by Ian Bassin, who served as counsel for the Obama administration from 2009 to 2011. Board member Cecilia Munoz served as the White House Director of Intergovernmental Affairs and Director of the Domestic Policy Council.

The group stated its mission is fighting the Trump administration because of its threat to democracy.

In the letter, signees describe the federal prosecutors who stepped down from the Rogers case as “heroic:”

Mr. Barr’s actions in doing the President’s personal bidding unfortunately speak louder than his words. Those actions, and the damage they have done to the Department of Justice’s reputation for integrity and the rule of law, require Mr. Barr to resign. But because we have little expectation he will do so, it falls to the Department’s career officials to take appropriate action to uphold their oaths of office and defend nonpartisan, apolitical justice. For these reasons, we support and commend the four career prosecutors who upheld their oaths and stood up for the Department’s independence by withdrawing from the Stone case and/or resigning from the Department. Our simple message to them is that we — and millions of other Americans — stand with them. And we call on every DOJ employee to follow their heroic example and be prepared to report future abuses to the Inspector General, the Office of Professional Responsibility, and Congress; to refuse to carry out directives that are inconsistent with their oaths of office; to withdraw from cases that involve such directives or other misconduct; and, if necessary, to resign and report publicly — in a manner consistent with professional ethics — to the American people the reasons for their resignation.

But if you read reports from CNN, CBS, NPR and other media outlets, one would get the impression that the good men and women who served their country at DOJ have risen up in a bipartisan effort to fight Barr and Trump’s effort to undermine the U.S. justice system.

CBS reported the letter campaign as coming from DOJ “alumni:”

The Justice Department alumni made their request to Barr in an open letter published Sunday and said the move by top officials at the department to overrule federal prosecutors in Stone’s case was “unheard of.” “Such behavior is a grave threat to the fair administration of justice,” the former officials wrote. “In this nation, we are all equal before the law. A person should not be given special treatment in a criminal prosecution because they are a close political ally of the president. Governments that use the enormous power of law enforcement to punish their enemies and reward their allies are not constitutional republics; they are autocracies.” The crisis of confidence that has ensnared the Justice Department reached a fever pitch last week after Barr overruled federal prosecutors who recommended Stone receive seven to nine years in prison for his November conviction on seven charges. The intervention led four prosecutors to abruptly withdraw from the case, and one resigned from the department altogether.

CNN reported that those signing onto the letter worked for both Republican and Democrat administrations:

“Mr. Barr’s actions in doing the President’s personal bidding unfortunately speak louder than his words. Those actions, and the damage they have done to the Department of Justice’s reputation for integrity and the rule of law, require Mr. Barr to resign. But because we have little expectation he will do so, it falls to the Department’s career officials to take appropriate action to uphold their oaths of office and defend nonpartisan, apolitical justice,” the officials wrote in a statement. The rare statement from the officials — mostly former career prosecutors, but also some former political appointees — came in the wake of an extraordinary week at the Justice Department. In just one week, career prosecutors withdrew from a case after Barr overruled their sentencing recommendation, the attorney general pushed back against the President in an unusual interview and separately ordered an examination of politically charged cases involving those close to President Donald Trump.

Aside from omitting the facts about who is behind the effort to oust Barr, the media also left out how anti-Trump pundits are also part of the effort, the Daily Caller reported:

Eight legal analysts who work for CNN and MSNBC or appear frequently on the networks signed a petition Sunday calling on Attorney General William Barr to resign over his handling of Roger Stone’s case. CNN analysts and former federal prosecutors Elie Honig and Renato Mariotti signed the petition, which has more than 1,140 signatures. MSNBC analysts Paul Butler, Frank Figliuzzi, Matthew Miller and Jill Wine-Banks also signed the document, which was compiled by Protect Democracy, a nonprofit group staunchly opposed to President Donald Trump. Nick Akerman, a former Watergate prosecutor who appears frequently on MSNBC, and Mimi Rocah, a former prosecutor who recently left MSNBC to run for a district attorney position, also signed the petition.

Barr is scheduled to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on March 31, where he will likely be pressed by Democrats about Stone as well as other issues.

250,"Nolte: Sam Donaldson Endorses Bloomberg, Trashes Trump as ‘Sick’",['John Nolte'],"To the surprise of no one, veteran ABC “newsman” Sam Donaldson burst out of the political closet to endorse Michael Bloomberg.

Anyone at all familiar with Donaldson is only surprised the 85-year-old has decided to admit to what many of us have known for decades, known going back to Ronald Reagan: that he’s a die-hard partisan and leftist.

Here’s the video of Donaldson endorsing Bloomberg:

Legendary journalist Sam Donaldson knows Mike has what it takes to take on Trump and beat him. Sam covered campaigns for 52 years, and this is the first time he's endorsed anyone. Welcome to #TeamBloomberg! pic.twitter.com/R24zUXXxRU — Team Bloomberg (@Mike2020) February 15, 2020

Here’s the full transcript:

Donaldson: Oligarchs who own billion-dollar corporate news operations that suppress negative news about them are good. The Orange Man is Bad. Oligarchs with a long history of black racism and treating females employees like third-class citizens are good. The Orange Man is Bad. Nanny-state oligarchs are preferable to any Republican who’s delivered a booming economy, record-low unemployment, record-low minority unemployment, millions of jobs, the first real wage increase in decades for the working and middle class, stable energy prices, a stable southern border, peace abroad, and fewer opioid deaths. The Orange Man is bad.

Okay, that’s not the actual transcript, but how can Donaldson, who identifies as a newsman, justify endorsing a man who owns a multibillion-dollar news operation that is now a multibillion-dollar propaganda operation?

The answer is pretty simple. Donaldson has never been a newsman, has never cared about the ideals and “norms” of journalism. He has always been a left-wing propagandist; as a White House reporter, as an anchor, and as an analyst on ABC’s This Week with David Brinkley, he has always abused and perverted his position as a “journalist” to flack for the Democrat Party and left-wing causes.

Donaldson has also always been something of a peacock, what you might describe as the Jim Acosta of his time — an obnoxious grandstander who heckled, shouted, and made speeches instead of simply asking questions. So it makes sense that in the twilight of his years, his ego would make it impossible for him to fade away with a little dignity… Why else would he suddenly pop out of the far-left closet and then follow this up with an appearance on the far-left CNN, where he attacked President Trump as a “sick, ignorant man.”

“We are in the grip” of a “sick, ignorant man,” Donaldson told CNNLOL.

“He’s mean, he’s corrupt and if we don’t get this right, we may lose the things that have made this country the best place to live in the world and that shining city on the hill that Ronald Reagan used to talk about, which was the envy of the world,” he added.

The idea that Donaldson, who spent every waking moment of the Reagan Years seeking to destroy Reagan, is now talking about the Gipper as some kind of ideal, is just too rich for words.

What a fraud.

Bottom line: Donaldson is desperate for attention, and this was the last barrel bottom he could scrape to get some.

But what’s the Bloomberg play here…?

Who makes up the “Sam Donaldson Constituency”?

The media?

Is this some sort of dog whistle from Bloomberg to attract the kind of media support that will give him an edge over his primary opponents?

Even that doesn’t make sense. It’s not as though the public at large knows who Donaldson is, and those of us old enough to remember him are not exactly filled with fond memories. And my understanding is that Donaldson was not all that well-liked among his colleagues, who saw him as a grandstanding peacock.

What’s more, Donaldson is committing the biggest sin you can in the corporate media: he’s piercing the phony shield of objectivity these cowards hide behind. ABC’s Emily Miller is not at all happy with Donaldson’s move:

I am really thrown off by seeing Sam Donaldson — my former boss @ABC — doing a political ad. This hurts all working reporters who are trying to prove to the public they aren't all liberal and biased. https://t.co/bBs6HneALJ — Emily Miller (@emilymiller) February 15, 2020

What a joke, especially when the face of ABC News is former Clintonista George Stephanopoulos, the guy who was still donating to the Clinton Foundation two decades after he joined ABC.

The thing is, though, none of this matters when it comes to Bloomberg.

When you have $50 billion at your disposal, you can throw it all up against the wall… Doesn’t matter if it sticks or not because you just open your wallet and hurl some more.",https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/02/17/sam-donaldson-endorses-bloomberg-trashes-trump-sick-ignorant/
251,"200,000 Brits Ditch BBC TV Tax in One Year: Report",['Victoria Friedman'],"Nearly 200,000 Britons have cancelled their television licence in one year, a report has revealed, while several Tories have called on Downing Street to stop its “vendetta” against the BBC by proposing that the broadcaster earn its own money.

The BBC is currently sustained by the £154.50 a year licence fee, which is a mandatory TV tax for anyone who watches live television, whether or not they consume BBC media.

Figures obtained by the Daily Mail from a Freedom of Information request have revealed that there was a drop of 198,184 licences from November 2018 (25,805,141) to November 2019 (25,606,957). The FoI release also revealed that bar one month, from January 2019 to November there was a steady decline in licence ownership.

The figures come after reports on Sunday that Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s administration plans to “whack” the licence fee model.

'We Will Whack It' – Boris Govt Takes On BBC with Plan to Scrap TV Licence https://t.co/boG5gkCMUF — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 16, 2020

“We are not bluffing on the licence fee,” a Downing Street source told The Times, continuing: “We are having a consultation and we will whack it. It has to be a subscription model. They’ve got hundreds of radio stations, they’ve got all these TV stations and a massive website. The whole thing needs massive pruning back.”

The source’s comments come two weeks after culture secretary Nicky Morgan said that the BBC could go the way of Blockbuster — outdated and bankrupt — unless it reforms.

Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom also warned in October that “public support for the licence fee could become eroded” in the future as young people switch off from the service, with half of people aged 16 to 24 not consuming any BBC media product even at least once a week.

Polling from December by YouGov revealed that half of Britons want the TV tax scrapped and for the BBC to make its own money either through a subscription service or advertising. Other polls revealed that Britons think the BBC is biased, with two studies pointing to pro-Brexit viewpoints being suppressed on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

Despite the mounting evidence that Britons are no longer happy to accept the BBC’s service as a mandatory tax, soft Tories have criticised the government for its so-called “vendetta” against the powerful broadcaster.

The former minister Damian Green called it “cultural vandalism”, in comments reported by The Times, while Huw Merriman MP said: “I’m not sure this vendetta against the BBC is going to end well.”

252,Alan Dershowitz: George Soros Asked Barack Obama to Investigate Undisclosed Person,['Joel B. Pollak'],"Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz told Breitbart News Sunday this weekend that billionaire left-wing financier George Soros told then-President Barack Obama to investigate someone.

Dershowitz would not identify who, precisely, the target of the investigation was, but said that the name would soon emerge in in a lawsuit that had yet to be filed.

The revelation was so startling that this host had to double-check:

Q: But let me just ask you — you said that George Soros asked Barack Obama to have his Justice Department investigate somebody? Dershowitz: We’re — that’s going to come out in a lawsuit in the near future. Yeah Q: Wow, well, we look forward to hearing more about that new. Dershowitz: That’s not unusual. That is not unusual. People whisper to presidents all the time. Presidents whisper to [the] Justice Department all the time. It’s very common. It’s wrong, whoever does it, but it’s common, and we shouldn’t think that it’s unique to any particular president. I have in my possession the actual 302 form [an FBI record of an interview], which documents this issue, and it will, at the right time, come out. But I’m not free to disclose it now because it’s a case that’s not yet been filed.

In addition, Dershowitz reflected on his experience in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, noting that his argument had been grotesquely distorted by CNN — so much so that he could, if he wanted to, sue the network.

CNN — and House impeachment managers — claimed Dershowitz said that the president can do whatever he wants to do, as long as he claims to have believed he was acting in the public interest. Dershowitz had specifically said that criminal-like behavior was indeed impeachable.

Dershowitz also said that former Trump associate Roger Stone deserved a new trial, given new revelations about the extreme political bias of the jury foreperson, who opposed both Trump and Stone.

Moreover, Dershowitz said that if Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) won the Democratic presidential nomination, it might force him to leave the Democratic Party and campaign against him nationwide.

How damaging is all of this to his campaign? The panel reacts. #FNS #FoxNews pic.twitter.com/rGIzP7YRaD

Fox News contributor Donna Brazile said on this week’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday” that she was “extremely dismayed” by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s reported sexist comments.

Host Chris Wallace said, “A big story, a take out in The Washington Post today about his, and you can see it there, his long history of sexist comments going back decades and women saying women believe he created a hostile workplace. How damaging to his campaign?”

Brazile said, “Extremely. Look, I think there are many people in the Democratic party looking at Mr. Bloomberg because he has the resources to take on President Trump. The question, in my judgment, is his record. I mean I am uncomfortable with his policies in New York. I understand he has apologized. I get that. I am for forgiveness. I am extremely dismayed at the information I read over the weekend about the sexist work environment.”

She added, “It is one thing to have this so-called top law enforcement policy of stop and frisk, it was ruled unconstitutional and it has taken him years to say I am sorry about that. He has the resources, but I am very uncomfortable with the record, very uncomfortable.”

254,Guardian Warns of ‘Ancient Microbes’ Emerging from Melting Permafrost,['Thomas D. Williams'],"The Guardian newspaper has published an essay describing a climate change dystopia that could result from inaction regarding global warming.

The article, an edited extract from The Future We Choose: Surviving the Climate Crisis by Christiana Figueres and Tom Rivett-Carnac, describes the world of 2050 where people suffer the dire consequences of a failure to curb greenhouse gas emissions.

“Melting permafrost is also releasing ancient microbes that today’s humans have never been exposed to and, as a result, have no resistance to,” the authors breathlessly relate. “Diseases spread by mosquitoes and ticks are rampant as these species flourish in the changed climate, spreading to previously safe parts of the planet, increasingly overwhelming us.”

“Worse still, the public health crisis of antibiotic resistance has only intensified as the population has grown denser in inhabitable areas and temperatures continue to rise,” they state.

This fictional account, republished by the UK’s flagship paper of climate alarmism — the Guardian — apparently seeks to terrify people into abandoning fossil fuels by painting a future so unbearably bleak it makes the Road Warrior or District Nine seem tame.

“The first thing that hits you is the air. In many places around the world, the air is hot, heavy and, depending on the day, clogged with particulate pollution. Your eyes often water. Your cough never seems to disappear,” evoke the authors.

“The increasing heat of the Earth is suffocating us and in five to 10 years, vast swaths of the planet will be increasingly inhospitable to humans,” they warn.

Last October the Guardian editors pledged to “give global heating, wildlife extinction and pollution the urgent attention and prominence they demand.”

They have embarked upon a crusade to convince the world that it is in the midst of an apocalyptic climate crisis that can only be averted by radically altering the structure of society, renouncing the use of cheap available energy in an effort to dramatically cut emissions of carbon dioxide.

Last week, the Guardian warned that entire cities in the UK could be under water by the end of the century.

Without “urgent action to adapt to and confront global heating,” the newspaper declared, Europe could face “possible forest fires, floods, droughts and deluges” by the year 2100.

Guardian writer Jennifer Rankin stated that climate change could produce a one-metre rise in sea levels over the next 80 years, which would mean “90% of the surface of Hull would be under water” and massive flooding could overwhelm English cities such as “Norwich, Margate, Southend-on-Sea, Runcorn and Blackpool.”

Meanwhile, “large areas of Spain, Portugal and France would be grappling with desertification, with the worst-affected zones experiencing a two and half-fold increase in droughts under the worst-case scenario,” Rankin wrote.

Last May, the Guardian declared it would no longer speak of climate skepticism but only of “deniers,” while replacing terms like “climate change” and “global warming” with the more emotionally charged expressions “climate crisis” and “global heating.”

As climate alarmist Zion Lights, spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion (XR), said on British television last October: “Alarmist language works.”

In January, the Guardian took a further step in its virtue signaling, renouncing adverts from fossil fuel companies.

“The Guardian will no longer accept advertising from oil and gas companies, becoming the first major global news organisation to institute an outright ban on taking money from companies that extract fossil fuels,” the paper announced.

255,'We Will Whack It' – Boris Govt Takes On BBC with Plan to Scrap TV Tax,['Jack Montgomery'],"Boris Johnson’s administration may be serious about taking on the BBC, with sources revealing plans to scrap the compulsory television licence which funds it.

At present, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) receives the bulk of its money by levying a compulsory £154.50 licence fee on anyone who watches live colour television — whether or not they consume BBC programming — or BBC iPlayer, with non-payment a criminal offence punished by fines which must be paid on pain of imprisonment.

Some discounts are available for special cases — for example, the blind are entitled to 50 per cent off — and the increasingly negligible portion of the viewing public who use a black and white television set are charged a smaller fee of £52 a year.

But the corporation, which got its start on television at a time when there were no private broadcasters, has come under increasing fire in recent years, with accusations that its current affairs output is biased and its entertainment output politically slanted.

Now, after years of ineffectual grumbling on the issue, the Conservative Party may finally be taking robust action, with Downing Street sources telling The Sunday Times that the Government intends to scrap the ad hoc television tax in favour of a Netflix-style subscription model.

It also wants to force the closure of most of its 61 radio stations — with only the classical music and current affairs oriented Radio 3 and Radio 4 protected — and drop some of its ten television channels, while scaling down its website and investing more in its World Service.

BBC Veteran: 'Kremlin' Style 'BBC Thought Police' Want to 'Mould' UK In Liberal-Left's Image https://t.co/AMGn9sQMms — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 22, 2019

“We are not bluffing on the licence fee,” a Downing Street source told the newspaper.

“We are having a consultation and we will whack it. It has to be a subscription model. They’ve got hundreds of radio stations, they’ve got all these TV stations and a massive website. The whole thing needs massive pruning back.

“They should have a few TV stations, a couple of radio stations and massively curtailed online presence and put more money and effort into the World Service, which is part of its core job.”

Perhaps most worryingly of all for old hands at the corporation are rumours the Government wants to ban their staff from “cashing in” on their publicly-funded profiles by taking lucrative outside work.

“It’s an outrage that people who make their profile at public expense should seek to give themselves further financial rewards and personal gain,” a source suggested.

“They’re basically making their names on the taxpayer and then cashing in. The BBC should immediately halt this practice and give the money to good causes.”

The BBC reform efforts will be led by former culture secretary John Whittingdale, whose remit from Downing Street was reportedly summarised as “Mission: attack”.

256,Pirro: Left Needs Illegal Immigrant Votes for Power — ‘They’ve Lost the Vote of Law-Abiding Americans’,['Jeff Poor'],"On Saturday, Fox News Channel’s Jeanine Pirro castigated the left’s unwillingness to enforce the law when it comes to illegal immigration, despite such enforcement having overwhelming support from the American public.

Pirro argued the left needs the vote of illegal immigrants because it has lost the vote of “law-abiding Americans.”

“These political clowns don’t care that Americans overwhelmingly support enforcement of the law,” she said. “So why wouldn’t the left? It’s simple. Their goal is power. They get that power when illegals vote because they know they’ve lost the vote of law-abiding Americans – the ones that support the Constitution, the foundation of our laws.”

She went on to say some on the left do not even hide their position on the issue in some cases.

“The leftists, on the other hand, prefer to subjugate the laws of the land, even if it means sacrificing the rest of us at their altar of political correctness and identity politics,” Pirro continued. “They know that if they give illegals driver’s licenses, they can then use as a point of identification to register to vote. They get another voter. But you might not even need that. There are politicians interested in having illegals just go vote.”

257,Stormy Daniels: Guilty Verdict Reveals Michael Avenatti’s ‘True Character’,['Amy Furr'],"Michael Avenatti’s “true character” was exposed following a Manhattan jury’s guilty verdict Friday, said his former client, Stormy Daniels.

“Sadly, it appears what Michael Avenatti did to me was just the tip of an iceberg of deceit,” wrote Daniels, who accused him of stealing $300,000 from her and also forging her signature, according to the New York Post.

“I am not surprised his dishonesty has been revealed on a grand scale. His arrogant, fraudulent and overly aggressive behavior became so pervasive that the jury found his true character,” she stated.

Friday, Avenatti was convicted of attempting to extort Nike by threatening to use his media access to hurt the company’s reputation and stock price unless it paid him up to $25 million, according to the Associated Press.

The report stated:

The convictions for attempted extortion and honest services fraud carry a combined potential penalty of 42 years in prison. Avenatti glared at the jurors as the verdict was being announced but said nothing. Afterward, he shook hands with his lawyers and told them “great job” before he was led back to the cell where he has been held since a judge found he had violated his bail conditions. His lawyer, Scott Srebnick, said he would appeal the conviction but otherwise declined to comment. A judge set sentencing for June.

At the trial, Avenatti did not testify but his lawyers claimed he had been following the instructions of an amateur youth basketball league director, who asked him to force the company to fire “corrupt” executives and “fix” its culture, CBS Los Angeles reported.

“Prosecutors argued Avenatti was over $15 million in debt when he tried to extort up to $25 million from Nike, while Avenatti’s lawyers said the money he legally requested to conduct an internal probe of the sportswear giant was a bargain,” the article read.

However, Avenatti reportedly said that “any claim that I was $15 million in debt is ridiculous, absurd and laughable.”

The case alleged that he attempted to extort Nike because he had evidence that company employees “funneled illegal payments to top high school basketball prospects and their families,” the report concluded.",https://www.breitbart.com/crime/2020/02/15/stormy-daniels-guilty-verdict-reveals-michael-avenattis-true-character/
258,Elizabeth Warren Vows to Fight On After Poor Showing in New Hampshire,['Penny Starr'],"Presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is getting some media attention after her single-digit, fourth-place finish in the New Hampshire primary, but it is not the kind candidates seek.

USA Today published an in-depth article about what has gone wrong in the Warren campaign — after only one caucus and a primary — and how it will not be easy to gain the momentum she needs to win the Democrat nomination.

A reporter talked to people who were at Warren’s final get out the vote rally in New Hampshire, including Richard Lemmerman, a 60-year-old investor from Hampton, New Hampshire.

“She’d make a good secretary of State, a great attorney general. I just don’t think she’s going to be a good president,” Lemmerman said.

“In the end, as people start to focus on who’s the best progressive that’s got a chance of going the whole way, Bernie was winning that battle,” Joe Trippi, who ran Vermont Gov. Howard Dean’s failed presidential bid in 2004, said in the USA Today piece. “When it came to who was moving at the end among women who really wanted to see a woman get the nomination … it starts to go to Amy.”

“She was just drifting down, as was Biden, and the others were basically gaining ground at her expense,” Trippi said.

USA Today interviewed Rachel Bitecofer, a political scientist and assistant director of the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University, who said the far-left progressive faction in 2020 has proven smaller than in 2016:

In New Hampshire, the two so-called “progressive lane” candidates, Sanders and Warren, accounted for only 35% of the overall vote. Bitecofer said more moderates and independents are taking part in the Democratic primary than in past years, including in New Hampshire, where voters registered as “undeclared” could take part.

“Her problem is there’s really two people in that progressive faction, but the amount of votes to divide between them is smaller and so she’s really struggling,” Bitecofer said.

Neil Levesque, director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College, told USA Today that New Hampshire voters put Warren ‘on a shelf’ when she struggled with her explanation about her Medicare for All plan.

“While they remained uncommitted, Sanders’ steady rise and Klobuchar’s debate performance last week eroded her support,” USA Today reported Levesque said of the Warren campaign.

“She worked very hard, she’s an excellent candidate, great staff,” he said. “Everything was there. But sometimes it just doesn’t add up.”

Warren and her campaign, of course, are sending out a different message after New Hampshire and ahead of Nevada and South Carolina primaries.

USA Today reported on Warren having a plan going forward:

Following the latest setback, Warren vowed to “fight back” as her campaign takes the long-view, noting 98% of Democrats still haven’t voted and insisting she’s the “consensus choice of the widest coalition of Democrats.” But with early voting already underway in some Super Tuesday states, and the Nevada caucuses looming in a week, a reboot is needed quickly. The day after the New Hampshire defeat, the Warren campaign issued an email to supporters that didn’t sugarcoat the outcome: “Let’s face it: Last night didn’t go the way we wanted it to go,” it began, later encouraging supporters to “take a moment and feel that pain” but to press on. Take a walk around the block, eat an extra piece of chocolate, hug your pet, adopt a pet, watch videos of cats and dogs who are friends, call a friend — whatever works,” the email read. “But once you’ve let it all out, take a deep breath, square your shoulders, and make a plan — a plan to fight back and win. A plan to help make sure that we won’t have to feel this way again.”

“It is a very fluid field, and even knocking on doors in Iowa and New Hampshire right up until Election Day, people were still making up their minds,” Michelle Wu, a Boston city councilor at-large and Warren supporter who campaigned for her in both states, said in the USA Today report. “Voters are really wanting to think about November. That means that it will be a long race and a long primary, and Elizabeth’s operation is built for the long haul”:

A third of delegates aren't decided until Super Tuesday. What we do now matters. Our campaign needs critical funds to reach voters and caucus-goers, so we’ve set an ambitious goal: $7 million before the Nevada caucuses.

And then there’s the financial reality of a presidential campaign. Data from Advertising Analytics show that Warren cut television ad spending in South Carolina but is maintaining advertising levels ahead of the February 22 Nevada caucuses.

“I need to level with you,” Warren said in a campaign video released Wednesday asking supporters to donate to the campaign. “Our movement needs critical funds so I can remain competitive in this race through Super Tuesday.”

CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked Warren directly if she knew why she did so poorly in New Hampshire.

“I don’t,” Warren said. “But I can tell you this: I can tell you that it’s what I fight for. And I’m going to get out there and keep fighting for it and keep talking about it. I think we are in a very frothy place right now, but do keep in mind, we’ve only heard from two states.”

“We have 98 percent of our states and territories left to go,” Warren said.

259,International Press Freedom Group Calls Out Mexican Police Assaulting Journalists During Protest,"['Ildefonso Ortiz', 'Brandon Darby']","One of the most prestigious press freedom groups is calling out Mexican state police officers who allegedly threatened and assaulted multiple journalists as they covered a series of protests that turned violent.

The Committee to Protect Journalists asked this week for a transparent investigation into a series of attacks against multiple journalists in the Mexican state of Veracruz. The attacks were carried out at the hands of the Fuerza Civil police force.

The attacks on the journalists took place on February 11 in Ciudad Isla, Veracruz, where various outlets were reporting on police brutality protests outside of a federal law enforcement building. Protesters demanded answers after the alleged sexual assault of a teenager and the forced disappearance of another. When protesters tried to force their way into the compounds, police officers shot into the crowd and beat some protesters in an attempt to disperse the crowd.

During the escalating conflict, police officers beat Alberto Carmona, a reporter for El Pinero de Cuenca newspaper, CPJ, said in a prepared statement. The press freedom organization also claimed that Julia Santín and Brígido López from the website Los Llanos del Sotaviento and Edna Lopez from A Titulo Personal were subjected to various death threats including having a gun pointed to the head of one of them. Also, police officers detained Sergio Herrera, a local radio journalist and César Estrada, from El Noreste newspaper.

“The use of disproportionate and indiscriminate force by police against reporters covering protests in Veracruz is unacceptable if Mexico wants to guarantee freedom of the press,” said Jan-Albert Hootsen, CPJ’s Mexico representative in a prepared statement. “Both federal and Veracruz state authorities must ensure that reporters can do their job without fear of falling victim to violence.”

The attacks on the journalists in Veracruz come one month after Mexico recorded its first murdered journalist in 2020. Authorities found the body of Fidel Avila Gomez in Michoacán, Breitbart Texas reported. In 2019, Breitbart Texas reported on the murder of 11 journalists in Mexico, most of those crimes remain unsolved.

260,CNN’s Cooper: Weaponizing Military ‘Next Step’ for Trump to Turn U.S. into Banana Republic,['Pam Key'],"CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Friday accused President Donald Trump of trying to turn the United States into a banana republic, given that he is “weaponizing the military.”

While discussing the Department of Justice is dropping its investigation into former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, Copper said, “It fits into the larger theme of weaponizing the Department of Justice against perceived enemies or just people the president doesn’t like.”

He continued, “There was a transcript released today in which the judge in this case previously told Justice Department attorneys that the handling of the case was disturbing in the judge’s words and getting close to a banana republic. Do you agree?”

McCabe said, “I absolutely agree. That’s one of the things that concerns me most about not just the president, but the way that the Justice Department has handled these matters that are clearly so important to this president. We don’t expect to live in a country where the previewed political enemies of the president suddenly become the subjects of criminal investigations in a pursuit to throw political enemies in jail.”

Cooper said, “Our system is set up, you know, in a very well-thought-out way with checks and balances. But when you start to look at what has gone on, you know, the president has —they’ve packed the courts with a lot of judges. You know, it hasn’t got a lot of attention over the last couple of years, but they’ve been very successful in getting a huge number of judges appointed by the president. Obviously, the Senate is not standing up to the president. At least, the Republicans in the Senate are afraid, clearly, of the blowback of contradicting this president. Mitt Romney is now a case study in what can happen if you do. There’s the Justice Department, which now seems to be weaponized.”

He continued, “I mean, the next step, I guess, is sort of weaponizing the military in some way. You know, talking about steps towards a banana republic. That is essentially the next step.”

McCabe said, “It is. And it’s frightening to think through these potential developments, but when you look back on the recent past and the experiences we’ve had as a nation, you can’t help but be very concerned for our future.”

261,FNC’s Wallace: A Lot of Republicans Think Bloomberg Is Toughest Guy Trump Could Face,['Pam Key'],"Fox News anchor Chris Wallace said, Friday that many Republicans were concerned the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg would be a tough opponent for President Donald Trump.

Wallace said, “The war of words between the president and Michael Bloomberg is quite astonishing. President getting some advice from people who support him, don’t go after Bloomberg because you are the president so all you do by attacking him is elevating him.”

He continued, “There are a lot of Republicans, Republicans yes who think Bloomberg is the toughest guy you could face. One because he’s got an even bigger campaign war chest than you do. Number two because he’s a relative moderate. There are some comments coming out but they are conservative comments or even potentially explosive on the right in terms of stop and frisk and redlining. Very hard to paint billionaire Michael Bloomberg as a socialist. So there is a lot of questions inside of the Republican Party. Do you really want to elevate Michael Bloomberg, because he could be a tough candidate in the fall.”

262,DOJ: Andrew McCabe Will Not Face Criminal Charges,['Ezra Dulis'],"Former Acting Director of the FBI Andrew McCabe will not face criminal charges for allegedly lying to agents about a leak to reporters, according to a Department of Justice (DOJ) letter released Friday afternoon.

DOJ tells former Acting Director of the FBI Andrew McCabe that it will not pursue charges against him. pic.twitter.com/imAyjZs9Nq — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 14, 2020

J.P. Cooney and Molly Gaston, two officials in the DOJ’s Fraud & Public Corruption Section, wrote to McCabe’s lawyers, saying, “after careful consideration, the Government has decided not to pursue criminal charges against your client, Andrew G. McCabe.”

McCabe was under investigation for reportedly lying to FBI agents in 2017 who were investigating a leak to the Wall Street Journal which he allegedly authorized. The Washington Post reported that a grand jury was impaneled for the case in 2018. Breitbart’s Joshua Caplan wrote:

In April, Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s long-awaited report concluded McCabe made false statements to U.S. officials on at least four occasions and improperly disclosed information to then-Wall Street Journal reporter Devlin Barrett “to advance his personal interests over those of the Justice Department.”

McCabe reacted to the news on CNN, saying the experience was “traumatic” for his family.

“As glad as I am that the DOJ and the DC attorney’s office finally decided to do the right thing today, it’s an absolute disgrace that they took two years and put my family through this experience for two years before they finally drew the obvious conclusion,” he said.

FOIA-ed FBI documents revealed this January that agents were frustrated with McCabe for wasting their time following other leads after he denied involvement in the WSJ leak.

“I remember saying to him, at, I said, ‘Sir, you understand that we’ve put a lot of work into this based on what you told us,’” the agent said. “I mean, and I even said, long nights and weekends working on this, trying to find out who amongst your ranks of trusted people would, would do something like that.’ And he kind of just looked down, kind of nodded, and said ‘Yeah I’m sorry.”

In response to the new evidence, a White House official told Breitbart News that the “hypocrisy” of the alleged wrongdoing was unacceptable. “Andrew McCabe, while serving as Deputy Director of the FBI, lied to the FBI,” the individual said. “Then he lied about lying. He has thrown thousands of men in jail for lying to federal investigators. This hypocrisy cannot go unpunished.”

Fox News reported in September 2019 that U.S. Attorney Jessie Liu recommended moving forward with charges, as lying to the FBI is a federal crime — the rationale for federal prosecution against several of President Donald Trump’s allies, such as Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn. McCabe was reportedly integral in setting up a fateful meeting where Flynn spoke to agents without legal counsel.

President Trump fired McCabe from his position in March 2018, just before he was scheduled to retire with full benefits. McCabe has since filed a lawsuit calling the firing “illegal,” published a memoir, and signed on as a CNN contributor.

The decision not to prosecute comes as Trump supporters accuse the federal government of carrying out injustice, applying different standards to people who violate the political orthodoxy of the “deep state” — or “interagency,” as federal employees call the larger body of unelected federal bureaucrats (McCabe, for his part, has denied that such a culture exists). This week, U.S. Attorney General William Barr has been under fire for the DOJ decreasing its recommended sentencing for Roger Stone, a pro-Trump veteran political operative. Stone was convicted of lying to Congress, obstructing a House investigation, and tampering with a witness, and prosecutors originally sought a seven to nine-year sentence; four attorneys resigned from the case after their superiors labeled the request “excessive.”",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/14/doj-andrew-mccabe-will-not-face-criminal-charges/
263,Bankrupt McClatchy Spread ‘Tea Party N-word’ Hoax,['Joel B. Pollak'],"McClatchy Co., which filed for bankruptcy protection this week, played a role in one of the most effective and damaging hoaxes ever deployed in the media’s war against the conservative grassroots: the “Tea Party N-word.”

In March 2010, thousands of Tea Party activists descended on the U.S. Capitol to protest as the House of Representatives, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), voted to approve Obamacare, over bipartisan opposition.

Democrats accused the Tea Party demonstrators of using the “N-word” to attack black members of Congress walking into and out of the Capitol, and McClatchy reported it:

Demonstrators outside the U.S. Capitol, angry over the proposed health-care bill, shouted “n-” yesterday at Rep. John Lewis, a Georgia congressman and civil rights icon who was nearly beaten to death during an Alabama march in the 1960s. The protesters also shouted obscenities at other members of the Congressional Black Caucus, lawmakers said. … “They were shouting, sort of harassing,” Lewis said. “But, it’s OK, I’ve faced this before. It reminded me of the ’60s. It was a lot of downright hate and anger and people being downright mean.”

But there was never any actual evidence that happened.

At one point, Pelosi, along with several members of the Congressional Black Caucus and other Democrats, staged a provocative march through the demonstration, as she wielded the giant Speaker’s gavel. Their goal was twofold: first to draw parallels between Obamacare and the civil rights movement; second, to provoke Tea Party demonstrators into ugly confrontations that would enable Democrats to call the movement “racist,” also fulfilling the civil rights analogy.

There was one problem: though the Tea Party protesters jeered Pelosi and the other Democrats, there was no racism.

This reporter was actually present at the first day of demonstrations, and saw no racism whatsoever from participants.

Andrew Breitbart offered $10,000, and then $100,000, to the United Negro College Fund if anyone could provide video proof of anyone shouting the “N-word” at the demonstration. Despite the thousands of people present at the protest, including journalists, many equipped with cameras, no proof was ever found and the reward was never collected.

McClatchy never corrected its article, and the image of the Tea Party as “racist” stuck in the public imagination.

264,Washington Post Spreads Fear of 'Trump Bullying Phenomenon' in Schools,['Penny Starr'],"The Washington Post published a longform article Thursday that claims President Donald Trump’s speeches on topics like immigration and national security have intensified bullying in schools across the country.

The article, titled “Trump’s words, bullied kids, scarred schools,” argues “[t]he president’s rhetoric has changed the way hundreds of children are harassed in American classrooms.”

Authors Hannah Natanson, John Woodrow Cox, and Perry Stein begin with the premise that Trump’s “inflammatory language… has seeped into schools across America. Many bullies now target other children differently than they used to, with kids as young as 6 mimicking the president’s insults and the cruel way he delivers them.”

Their evidence? The reporters say “Trump’s words, those chanted by his followers at campaign rallies and even his last name have been wielded by students and school staff members to harass children more than 300 times since the start of 2016,” according to a review of 28,000 news stories. They also found 45 incidents over that period where children or teens were bullied because they support Trump.

Yes, the paper really has dedicated 5,000+ words to fewer than 400 incidents in the past 1,500 days across 130,000 K-12 schools. That is an average of one reported incident every 3.75 days nationwide, or .000002 incidents per day per school district.

To try to make up for these facts, the authors offer this excuse: “Most schools don’t track the Trump bullying phenomenon, and researchers didn’t ask about it in a federal survey of 6,100 students in 2017.” They then cite a web survey from the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) to suggest that thousands of incidents “never made the news.” This is the same SPLC that one of the Post‘s own columnists says “has lost all credibility” because of its loose, hyper-partisan definition of “hate.” Regardless, the story wallows in anecdotes to press forward with its thesis.

“It’s gotten way worse since Trump got elected,” said Ashanty Bonilla, 17, a Mexican American high school junior in Idaho who faced so much ridicule from classmates last year that she transferred. “They hear it. They think it’s okay. The president says it… Why can’t they?”

Miracle Slover said one of her teachers at a Fort Worth Texas high school was a fan of the president and forced minorities student to sit in the back of the room.

“Every day was something new with immigration,” said Miracle, now 18, who has a black mother and a mixed-race father. “That Trump needs to take [immigrants] away. They do drugs, they bring drugs over here. They cause violence.” The teacher, Georgia Clark, was fired last summer for a series of public messages to the president asking him for help with deporting illegal immigrants from her neighborhood.

The Post does allot a small percentage of its report to the harassment of students who support Trump.

“School staff members in at least 18 states, from Washington to West Virginia, have picked on students for wearing Trump gear or voicing support for him,” the authors write. “Among teenagers, the confrontations have at times turned physical. A high school student in Northern California said that after she celebrated the 2016 election results on social media, a classmate accused her of hating Mexicans and attacked her, leaving the girl with a bloodied nose. Last February, a teenager at an Oklahoma high school was caught on video ripping a Trump sign out of a student’s hands and knocking a red MAGA cap off his head.”

But the overarching theme of the Post’s report is stirring up fear that Trump and his supporters are creating a dangerous atmosphere in our nation’s schools.

However, these anecdotes are contradicted by federal data on overarching trends. According to stopybullying.gov, the media has a responsibility to report on bullying in an accurate way and devotes a large portion of its website to spelling out best practices for reporting on this issue. The Post’s report violates or ignores almost all of these guidelines.

The advice includes a section titled “What the Public Needs to Know About Bullying:”

Although concern about it is growing, bullying isn’t an epidemic. In fact, national rates have decreased slightly in recent years.

Bullying does not cause suicide; it’s only one of many factors involved.

Bullying can affect any young person, but there are characteristics and circumstances that put certain youth at higher risk.

Each bullying incident is a complex interaction. While there might be one “ringleader,” the bystanders often are involved.

Cyberbullying is not nearly as common as people think.

Some prevention strategies seem to help, and researchers continue to learn about what works.

And while the Post story links to some statistics from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the authors ignore data from the federal body showing a reduction in bullying almost across the board.

265,Nolte – Rap Sheet: **389** Media-Approved Hate Crimes Against Trump Supporters,['John Nolte'],"Violence against Trump supporters is surging of late, so Breitbart News is updating its list of credibly reported hate crimes against Trump supporters since September 2015.

These reported crimes include physical assaults, vandalism, an actual murder, and encouraging violence against individuals and groups based only on their personal beliefs.

Sadly, these crimes have been approved and encouraged by the establishment media, either through the media’s open calls for violence against us or the media’s revealing and deafening indifference.

When the corporate media want to stop Americans from engaging in certain behavior — say, a rodeo clown wearing an Obama mask or a meme mocking CNN — the media launch jihads to destroy the individuals engaged in that behavior.

But when it comes to violence against President Trump and his supporters, this is only met by the media’s silence or a shrug — or in the case of CNN, a reward — which is the media’s way of communicating their approval.

Thanks to the corporate media, every law-abiding citizen in America is in danger. And never forget that this same media are using their multibillion-dollar lobbying power to disarm us, to ensure we’re helpless.

And never forget that the violence against us will only get worse as the 2020 presidential election heats up.

Please email jnolte@breitbart.com with any updates or anything you think deserves to be added to this list. Also, if you see errors — duplicate postings or events misinterpreted as bias crimes on Trump supporters, please let us know.

266,San Francisco Public Library’s Most Commonly Stolen Book: Michael Savage’s ‘Liberalism Is a Mental Disorder’,['Robert Kraychik'],"Radio icon Michael Savage’s Liberalism is a Mental Disorder: Savage Solutions is “the most commonly stolen book at the San Francisco Public Library,” reported the San Francisco Chronicle on Friday, quoting the local library’s spokesperson.

Kate Patterson, spokesperson for the San Francisco Public Library, wrote, “The one author our head of collections has to check regularly and purchase new copies of are books by Michael Savage. We check once a year to see if all the copies are gone and reorder. We have moved to e-book for most of them, so we can ensure copies are around. The main title that disappears quickly is Liberalism Is A Mental Disorder.”

“We have found that [Michael Savage’s] political titles go missing more often,” Patterson added.

Contacted by the San Francisco Chronicle about the findings, Savage laughingly said, “What an honor.”

Invited to speculate about the theft of his books, Savage said, “Who is stealing it? Is it people who are poor who agree with my message and want it, or is it people taking it out and trashing it to throw it away?”

Savage urged left-wing persons to read his books. “I think they need an alternative viewpoint in that the entire media is skewed one way. It’s a one-party state. It’s a one-media state. I don’t think any rational liberal wants to live in an autocracy. We know what the left thinks in San Francisco. Do we know what the rational educated right thinks?”

As a resident of San Francisco, Savage often mocks the city’s left-wing culture and politics with the moniker, “San Fran-Sicko.”

Originally published in 2005, Savage wrote of illegal immigration in Liberalism Is a Mental Disorder, “I envision an Oil for Illegals program . … The president should demand one barrel of oil from Mexico for every illegal that sneaks into our country.”

Savage regularly summarizes his nationalistic political ethos with a three-word slogan, “Borders, language, culture.”

267,EXCLUSIVE: Gunman Who Allegedly Killed U.S. Citizen at International Bridge to Texas Arrested,"['Ildefonso Ortiz', 'Brandon Darby']","REYNOSA, Tamaulipas – Mexican authorities arrested the alleged gunman who killed a U.S. citizen shortly before Christmas Eve while he waited at an international bridge to Texas.

Monday evening in Reynosa, the Tamaulipas Attorney General’s Office arrested Jose Angel Sanchez Mungia on charges of murder and car theft. Sanchez Mungia is the prime suspect behind the December 23 death of Oscar Manuel Resendez at the Hidalgo-Reynosa International Bridge during a robbery gone wrong.

Resendez, a 41-year-old dentist who lived in Mission, Texas, but worked in Reynosa, was waiting to enter the U.S when a gunman held him up and tried to take his vehicle. Resendez tried to resist and was fatally shot. The victim provided dental services to employees of state-owned oil company Pemex. The fatal robbery comes at a time when Reynosa is seeing a dramatic rise in similar violence.

Authorities spoke with an eyewitness who reportedly saw Sanchez Mungia shoot and kill Resendez. Investigators were able to get a physical description of the murder suspect. Officials tracked down the victim’s 2019 Honda C-HR and evidence leading to the home of Sanchez Mungia.

During a search of the property, authorities found a .357 Rossi revolver that is believed to be the weapon used to fire the .38 caliber rounds that killed Resendez. Authorities also found traces of the victim’s blood in the handgun and in other places.

The driver, a Mexican national, allegedly presented a fake California driver’s license.

Agents assigned to the Highway 86 immigration checkpoint observed a tractor-trailer rig approaching for inspection. During an initial immigration interview, the driver presented a California driver’s license, according to information obtained from El Centro Sector Border Patrol officials.

While the agent spoke with the driver, a K-9 detection team alerted to the rear of the trailer. The agents referred the driver to a secondary inspection station.

Agents searched the trailer and found 26 “undocumented immigrants,” officials reported. The migrants were locked inside the trailer with no means of escape in the event of abandonment or a crash. Officials reported the temperature inside the trailer to be less than 45 degrees.

A further interview with the driver revealed his California driver’s license to be “an imposter document.” In reality, agents determined the man to be a Mexican national, illegally present in the U.S.

Agents identified the 26 migrants as being illegal immigrants. The 26 included one male and one female juvenile. All 26 and the illegal alien driver were arrested and taken to the Border Patrol station for processing.

“The undocumented immigrants were locked and trapped inside this tracker-trailer in below 45-degree weather with no safety restraints,” said Chief Patrol Agent Gloria I. Chavez. “This smuggling organization had no regard for the safety of the people they were smuggling. Fortunately, our agents were able to remove them from that potentially life-threatening situation.”

However, said bunker was previously discovered in 2018 and was only used to store damaged vehicles.

Mexico’s Army announced the discovery on Sunday with a news release and video featuring a group of soldiers walking cautiously toward the structure and entering a dark tunnel with flashlights. Inside, authorities only found a burned-out SUV and spent bullet casings. They also witnessed makeshift road spikes strewn along the entrance.

The structure was built to hide armored vehicles and other combat materials but sat unused in recent months.

Law enforcement sources revealed to Breitbart Texas that the bunker is private property and was legally protected from demolition.

The border city of Reynosa, immediately south of the Texas cities of McAllen, Hidalgo, Mission, and Pharr, is currently a hotspot of violence as rival factions of the Gulf Cartel fight for control of lucrative drug and human smuggling routes.

270,Migrants Stuffed in Trunk During Failed Arizona Human Smuggling Effort,['Bob Price'],"Tucson Sector Border Patrol agents apprehended five migrants and an alleged American citizen human smuggler during an attempt to move the men into the U.S. interior. The bust occurred on the outskirts of Tucson, Arizona.

Border Patrol agents conducted an immigration traffic stop at the Tucson city limits on February 13. As the agent approached the vehicle, he observed a person lying on the floor of the rear seats. The agent determined that person to be an illegal immigrant, according to Tucson Sector officials.

The agent carried out a search of the vehicle and found four additional migrants packed inside the trunk. The agent arrested the driver, a U.S. citizen, and the five passengers. Immigration interviews confirmed four of the men came to the U.S. from Mexico — the fifth from Guatemala, officials reported.

“The dangerous tactic of smuggling humans in a trunk is an ongoing trend,” Tucson Sector Border Patrol officials said in a written statement. “It demonstrates the lack of value smuggling organizations place on the lives of illegal aliens.”

Border Patrol officials seized the vehicle and placed the alleged smuggler in custody pending charges for human smuggling in violation of 8 USC 1324. If convicted, the driver could spend up to 10 years in federal prison.

Agents processed the five migrants for removal under CBP guidelines.

“U.S. Border Patrol officials warn that placing humans in a vehicle’s trunk or bed can be extremely dangerous,” officials stated. “The risks, including carbon monoxide poisoning and serious injury or death in the event of a vehicle collision, increase when people are hidden in compartments to avoid detection by law enforcement officials.”

271,GRAPHIC-EXCLUSIVE: Murder in Mexican Border State Points to Rise of Independent Narco-Gangs,['Cartel Chronicles'],"MONTERREY, Nuevo Leon – Multiple cells of independent meth dealers managed to grow in power and size to the point where they began to actively clash with other drug cartels who are trying to control all the drug markets.

Unlike the border cities of Reynosa and Nuevo Laredo where large scale gun-battles are commonplace, the violence between cartels and independent cells in Monterrey manifests itself in the form of targeted assassinations. The violence comes after the Cartel Del Noreste faction of Los Zetas made a big push to control the distribution of meth in the Monterrey metropolitan area.

One of the most recent hits took place this week in the bathroom of an amusement park called Bosque Magico (Magical Forest) when a gunman approached Rodolfo “El Rodo” Hinojosa Hernandez and shot at him four times with a 9mm handgun. One of the shots struck Hinojosa in the head killing him almost instantly. Two other gunmen waited for the assassin outside of the amusement park inside an SUV with Tamaulipas license plates. Authorities believe the murder is tied to a turf war with the CDN-Los Zetas or that it could be payback for other murders tied to a drug gang led by El Rodo.

Law enforcement sources revealed to Breitbart Texas that El Rodo was the leader of an independent cell of meth dealers who operate out of the suburbs of Santa Catarina, Garcia, and Escobedo. Law enforcement sources revealed to Breitbart Texas that the group led by El Rodo operates under the name La Linea, however, they have no connection with the La Línea faction of the Juárez Cartel.

In addition to his criminal activities, El Rodo also produced independent rap videos with a rap group called Low Barrio 1613.

Hinojosa’s body was identified by his wife Yaneth Herrera Campos who was recently arrested along with her husband in a drug raid tied to the distribution of five kilograms of meth. It remains unclear how the two were out of prison after their arrest since El Rodo had a pending arrest warrant. He previously managed to beat other murder charges due to a lack of witnesses. Breitbart Texas reported on multiple cases where Mexican judges have dismissed or released cartel operators in Mexico under suspicious circumstances.

272,1K Migrants Returned to Mexican Interior Under New Trump Program,['Bob Price'],"U.S. Immigration and Customs and Border Protection agents teamed up to return more than 1,000 Mexican migrants deep into their country’s interior under a new Trump Administration program.

During the peak of the 2019 migrant border crisis, the Trump Administration negotiated an agreement to return Mexican nationals found illegally in the United States into Mexico’s interior, according to information obtained from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials. Under previous agreements, Mexican nationals were simply returned to across the border–making it easy to simply re-cross elsewhere.

Under the Interior Repatriation Initiative (IRI) joint agreement, U.S. officials returned more than 1,000 Mexican nationals illegally present in the U.S. to the interior of Mexico instead of a trans-border removal. “The IRI is a joint agreement between the governments of the United States and Mexico to ensure that those repatriated to Mexico are returned closer to their homes in a safe and expeditious manner,” CBP officials said in a written statement.

“This is yet another successful Trump Administration initiative that demonstrates our urgency to apprehend and quickly remove those who illegally cross our border,” CBP Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan said. “By returning these individuals into the interior of Mexico, they will be much less likely to attempt a dangerous and potentially deadly journey north.”

On Friday, ICE agents flew 106 Mexican nationals from Tucson, Arizona, to Guadalajara. The government of Mexico will provide transportation for the migrants from Guadalajara to their home of record.

“This framework will reduce recidivism and border violence by returning Mexican nationals closer to their cities of origin,” ICE officials stated. “ICE works closely with CBP to ensure the safe and timely removal of individuals who have unlawfully crossed the southern border.”

The program is carried out in the U.S. by CBP, ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, and ICE Air Operations.",https://www.breitbart.com/border/2020/02/17/1k-migrants-returned-to-mexican-interior-under-new-trump-program/
273,Fleeing Cartel Gunman Held Students at Gunpoint in Mexican Border City,['Cartel Chronicles'],"MATAMOROS, Tamaulipas – A cartel gunman fleeing from Mexican authorities ran into a school and held some students at gunpoint until state police arrested him. The school incursion came just hours after a shootout in the city’s downtown area spread panic among residents.

The violence began earlier this week near the intersection of 14th and Morelo streets in downtown Matamoros when state police officers tried to pull over a white pickup truck. The driver of the vehicle sped away setting off a high chase where gunmen and police officers exchanged gunfire. The chase ended near the intersection of 19th and Morelos streets when the driver of the SUV crashed and another short shootout ensued.

The violence reignited hours later at a private high school called Centro Universitario Noreste (CUN) when a gunman running away from police barged into the campus and pointed his gun at numerous students as he tried to avoid being captured. State police officers entered the school and began searching for him. The search inside the campus eventually led to the capture of the gunman. The scene caused panic among the students some of whom ran out of the school due to the potential of a shootout.

After the incident, school officials released a statement confirming that a man running away from police had entered the campus and authorities arrested him. Classes resumed shortly after the incident.

274,Two Texas Men Sentenced for Selling Machine Guns Bound for Mexican Cartels,['Bob Price'],"A federal judge in South Texas sentenced two men to federal prison for selling guns to an undercover investigator. The undercover agent told the men the money for the guns, including machine guns, came from Mexico.

U.S. District Court Judge Micaela Alvarez sentenced two South Texas men to federal prison for their roles in selling guns to a buyer they believed would be transporting the guns to Mexico. The two men pleaded guilty to the charges on November 25, 2019, according to information obtained from the office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Texas, Ryan Patrick.

The judge sentenced Martin Guerra, 44, to 50 months in federal prison and his co-conspirator Saul De La Garza, 46, to 78 months in federal prison, Patrick’s office said in a written statement. Both men will serve an additional 30 months of supervised release following their prison term.

Federal criminal complaints obtained by Breitbart Texas revealed the men, in June 2019, sold an AR-15 style rifle, two selector switches, and two Glock pistols to an undercover agent for shipment to Mexico in violation of the Arms Export Control Act (22 USC 2778).

“The men believed the weapons would ultimately be illicitly transported to Mexico,” federal prosecutors said in a written statement. “Through the course of the investigation, Guerra bragged that he would be able to provide as many weapons as desired. De La Garza claimed he would be able to transport firearms from Houston to the Rio Grande Valley and coordinated with Guerra to make the sale of the machine guns.”

Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives teamed up to investigate the case.

Guerra remains in federal custody pending a prison assignment while Garza is free on bond and will be ordered to voluntarily surrender some time in the future.

275,Another Armed Human Smuggler Arrested in Texas near Border,['Bob Price'],"Del Rio Sector Border Patrol agents apprehended an allegedly armed human smuggler during a human smuggling attempt. Del Rio Sector agents have observed an increasing trend in armed human smugglers.

Agents assigned to the Brackettville Border Patrol Station observed a 2019 Nissan SUV approaching the immigration checkpoint for inspection on February 12. The agents referred the driver to a secondary inspection station for further questioning.

During the immigration inspection, agents determined the five passengers in the vehicle were illegal aliens, according to information provided to Breitbart Texas by Del Rio Sector officials with U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The agent determined the five migrants came to the U.S. from Ecuador.

Agents arrested the driver, a 21-year-old U.S. citizen for attempting to smuggle five illegal aliens further into the U.S. interior, officials stated. Agents carried out a search of the vehicle and found a 9mm Taurus pistol hidden under the driver’s seat.

“Our agents are encountering armed smugglers now more than ever before,” Del Rio Sector Chief Patrol Agent Raul L. Ortiz said in a written statement, “These are dangerous criminals who continue to show little regard for human life.”

If convicted on the human smuggling charge, 8 USC 1324, the suspect could face up to ten years in federal prison. The Ecuadoran migrants will be processed under CBP guidelines, officials stated.

Earlier this month, Comstock Station Border Patrol agents arrested a Mexican national who was found illegally in the U.S., Breitbart Texas reported. During a search of the subject, the agents say they found a loaded .380 pistol. The agents questioned the man and learned he had stolen the pistol from a nearby ranch, according to information obtained from Del Rio Sector Border Patrol officials.

In January, Del Rio Sector agents found an armed human smuggler at an interior checkpoint near Eagle Pass, Texas. Officials identified the driver as a 22-year-old male U.S. citizen. They also identified the passenger as a 21-year-old male U.S. citizen. Both accused smugglers are reported to be from Crystal City, Texas. A search of the vehicle uncovered a loaded .40 caliber Smith & Wesson pistol concealed under the driver’s seat, Breitbart Texas reported.

In early November, Brackettville Station agents arrested a 46-year-old twice deported Honduran man on a ranch frequently utilized by human smugglers to circumvent a nearby immigration checkpoint. A search of the area uncovered a backpack belonging to the Honduran national.

The actions of the smuggler placed the lives of the public and five migrants, including a teenager, in danger, officials stated.

On Tuesday morning, San Diego Sector Border Patrol agents assigned to the Interstate 8 immigration checkpoint observed a 2001 Mercedes sedan approaching for inspection. The driver abruptly turned around and fled from the checkpoint after being asked to proceed to a secondary inspection station, according to information obtained from Border Patrol officials in southern California.

The driver allegedly fled at a high rate of speed until other agents deployed a “vehicle immobilization device” which flattened two of the vehicle’s tires.

The driver continued to flee, driving erratically, officials stated. The pursuit continued until the driver lost control and slid into the center median of the interstate highway. As the vehicle stopped, the five passengers jumped out of the car and attempted to flee into the brush.

Agents said the driver, a 39-year-old U.S. citizen, remained inside the vehicle and then injected himself with a syringe. Agents later determined the syringe contained heroin. The agent ordered the man to remove the syringe and get out of the car. The suspect followed the agent’s commands and got out of the vehicle. The agent placed him under arrest.

Other agents carried out a search of the area and brought the five foreign nationals into custody. The subjects included two men, two women, and a 16-year-old boy — all Mexican nationals illegally present in the U.S., officials reported.

Border Patrol agents transported the Mexican migrants to the station where they will be “processed for removal.”

“This is another example of the dangerous acts human smugglers perform for financial gain and how they show no regard for human life,” Chief Patrol Agent Aaron Heitke said in a written statement. “Fortunately, this pursuit came to a safe conclusion and ended with the driver in custody.”

The agents transported the suspected human smuggler to a local facility for detox from the injection. He will face federal charges for alien smuggling.",https://www.breitbart.com/border/2020/02/13/fleeing-human-smuggler-injects-self-with-heroin-before-arrest-says-border-patrol/
277,GRAPHIC: Gulf Cartel Dumps Body at Mexican Border City Elementary School,['Cartel Chronicles'],"The turf war between rival factions of the Gulf Cartel led to the discovery of three separate bodies in the border city of Reynosa. A narco-message at one scene references the struggle between the Matamoros and Reynosa factions.

The discoveries began Monday morning when residents of El Anhelo, just south of the city’s downtown, called authorities about a body wrapped in a blanket. Police found the bound corpse of a young woman. Nearby, a poster board signed by a leading member of the Metros faction threatened rivals and notes the woman had a relationship with them.

Soon after, authorities were called to the Loma Alta neighborhood approximately one mile from the first scene, which was situated outside an elementary school. Authorities found an unidentified man who was shot several times.

Shortly after noon, federal and state police found the third body near a dirt road on the city’s outskirts. The area had been subjected to regular patrols from officials due to heightened cartel activity in recent days. At the scene, investigators found an unidentified male with “signs of a violent death.”

The murders in Reynosa come as the border city sits in the middle of a turf war between rival factions of the Gulf Cartel for its lucrative drug and human smuggling routes.

278,Eight Mexican Border State Cops Face Arrest for Allegedly Shooting Innocent Motorist,"['Ildefonso Ortiz', 'Brandon Darby']","A Mexican border state judge issued an arrest warrant against eight police officers in connection with the shooting death of an innocent motorist over the past weekend. The warrant comes days after the officers allegedly fired more than 250 rounds at the victim after apparently mistaking his pickup for a cartel vehicle.

On Wednesday afternoon, a judge in the border city of Reynosa granted an arrest warrant requested by the Tamaulipas Attorney General’s Office against eight officers on the charge of “qualified homicide” in connection with the February 7 shooting death of 23-year-old Juan Daniel Ortiz in Rio Bravo. The officers were previously suspended and Mexico’s Human Rights Commission (CNDH) was also probing the case.

The shooting took place in the border city of Rio Bravo, south of Donna, Texas. The victim worked at a manufacturing plant in Reynosa as an engineer and is not believed to have any ties to organized crime. Information obtained by Breitbart Texas revealed that a squad of state police were alerted to a group of gunmen roaming the area before they reportedly mistook the white pickup being driven by Ortiz. The victim was not armed when his vehicle took more than 250 rounds.

The shooting comes at a time when the border cities of Rio Bravo and Reynosa are seeing a spike in skirmishes as rival factions of the Gulf Cartel fight for turf. Gunmen also regularly clash with police along city streets and rural routes.

The rescue comes almost a week after authorities captured a leading commander with the Cartel Del Noreste faction of Los Zetas in the border city of Nuevo Laredo.

The rescue took place on Thursday morning in the Rio Bravo neighborhood south of Laredo, Texas.

According to information released by the Mexican Army, soldiers were patrolling when they spotted a suspicious vehicle containing the kidnapping victim. Details of the takedown were not released, however, the Army noted the arrests of six suspects and seized 27 makeshift road spikes. These items are commonly used to puncture the tires of pursuing police vehicles or cause traffic jams to cover escapes.

The rescue follows less than a week after the Mexican Army arrested a leading commander with the CDN-Los Zetas. Known as “El Takia,” Pablo Cesar Guajardo Alvarez was in charge of CDN foot soldiers in Nuevo Laredo. He faces murder charges in connection with a deadly attack on five employees of the Tamaulipas Attorney General’s Office.

281,Mexican Border State Quarantines Businessman Returning from China for Potential Coronavirus,"['Ildefonso Ortiz', 'Brandon Darby']","A businessman who returned from China and began showing symptoms of a respiratory ailment remains in quarantine pending the outcome of further tests, Mexico’s federal government confirmed late Wednesday. The case marks the second of its kind this year along the U.S.-Mexico border–though the first case was eventually cleared.

In a daily update, Mexico’s Health Secretariat listed the new potential case from Nuevo Leon as the second pending case, with 13 previously ruled negative. The other possible case is in Guanajuato.

In Nuevo Leon, state health officials identified the patient in a prepared statement as a 45-year-old businessman who had returned from China on January 30 and began showing symptoms of a respiratory illness on February 10. The patient is being treated at the University Hospital in Monterrey where doctors await the results of blood work to determine if he has the 2019-NCOV strain. The patient’s family is also quarantined.

In late January, a college professor who spent the Christmas holidays in China became the first border state case to be listed as suspicious in nature. That case was ruled out days later after blood samples revealed he suffered from a common cold.

282,Texas Border City Ex-Mayor Arrested on Federal Fraud Charges,"['Ildefonso Ortiz', 'Brandon Darby']","Federal agents arrested a former Texas border city mayor for allegedly using his position to steer a municipal public relations services contract. He is also accused of selling some of his real estate interests to the City at an inflated price. Two charges of wire fraud stemming from an indictment were handed down by a grand jury this week.

Jose Adolfo “Fito” Salinas, 81, the long-time mayor of La Joya who was ousted last year, is currently in federal custody. Salinas faces two wire fraud charges, according to the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Texas.

One of the charges relates to Salinas allegedly using his position to sell real estate to the City at a highly inflated rate. Federal authorities also arrested his daughter, Frances Salinas, who was the interim director for the City’s public housing authority in December 2019. Agents also arrested Sylvia Garces Valdez, the vice-chairwoman of the La Joya Housing Authority Board and an employee at the La Joya Independent School District.

The second charge relates to a public relations services contract where the City of La Joya hired Garces Valdez to run municipal social media accounts. As Breitbart Texas reported in August, the contract contained an unusual clause that called for Garces to receive a $12,000 retainer. According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Frances Salinas was set to receive some of the money that the City paid to Garces Valdez.

La Joya is a known human and drug smuggling corridor with a long history of corruption. In early 2019, a jury in a federal trial convicted former La Joya Police Chief Geovanni Hernandez on drug trafficking charges for his role in protecting loads he believed were tied to the Gulf Cartel. Court testimony pointed to Hernandez bragging about being friends with a former leader of the cartel. Hernandez is now serving a 20-year prison sentence.

La Joya is the same city that in 2014 was the scene of a three-hour standoff and shootout where 29-year-old Joaquin “El Cruzador” Cibrian, a prison gang member working for the Gulf Cartel, died in a hail of bullets after shooting two police officers. That shootout began when detectives from another city tried to arrest Cibrian for the execution of a 19-year-old man from Mexico over a stolen cocaine load. After shooting the two officers, Cibrian barricaded himself in a house until SWAT officers retaliated.

283,Harsh Weather Leaves Three Migrants Dead in California Mountains near Border,['Bob Price'],"San Diego Sector Border Patrol agents rescued two migrants in the mountains near the California border with Mexico. Three others succumbed to the inclement weather conditions despite efforts to save their lives.

Early in the afternoon of February 10, California Highway Patrol 911 operators notified Border Patrol dispatch about a group of five people in desperate need of medical assistance. Dispatchers deployed agents and a Border Search, Trauma, and Rescue (BORSTAR) team to the area, according to information obtained from San Diego Sector Border Patrol officials.

The agents began a search and rescue operation in the rugged terrain of the Laguna Mountains region. Officials reported the inclement weather led to life-endangering conditions. BORSTAR agents located two men from the group. The men admitted to being Mexican nationals, illegally present in the United States, officials stated.

The men told the agents about three women they abandoned who were “in desperate need of medical attention.” A U.S. Customs and Border Protection helicopter aircrew arrived on the scene and assisted in locating the missing women. The aircrew located the women at approximately 5 p.m. and directed BORSTAR agents to the scene.

When the agents arrived, they found two of the women to be unresponsive with “no signs of life.” The third woman appeared to be going in and out of consciousness. The agents began lifesaving measures on the third woman while other agents started CPR on the two lifeless women. All life-saving efforts failed and the three women died at the scene.

Inclement weather conditions prevented the AMO helicopter crew from being able to hoist any of the patients to safety. Agents were slated to return to the scene on Tuesday to recover the remains of the decedents. Their bodies will be turned over to the Coroner’s Office after being recovered from the mountainous area.

Agents arrested the two Mexican men, ages 22 and 37 on immigration violations.

“This incident that resulted in the tragic loss of lives was totally avoidable,” San Diego Sector Chief Patrol Agent Aaron Heitke said in a written statement. “We have said it many times, do not place your life or the lives of your loved ones in the hands of ruthless smugglers.”

“I am proud of the heroic efforts that these agents and our partners made to locate and provide aid to those in need,” the chief continued. Our agents also put their own lives at risk traversing the dangerous routes that these criminal organizations smuggle people through in an attempt to avoid apprehension.”

During a press conference on Tuesday, Acting CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan blamed the deaths of migrants being smuggled into the U.S. squarely on the hands of Mexican cartels and transnational criminal organizations engaged in the highly-lucrative business of human smuggling, Breitbart Texas reported. He cautioned migrants that due to changes in policies in the U.S., Mexico, and Guatemala, the dangerous journey is not worth the risk of death and abuse in the human smuggling process.

“Our message is clear — don’t do it,” Morgan stated. “Don’t risk your lives, don’t risk the lives of your family because the game has changed. Eight months ago, your chance of being allowed into the United States was pretty high. That has changed. Catch and release has all but done. You’re not going to be allowed in the United States while you’re awaiting your immigration proceeding. So, it’s not worth the risk like it was.”",https://www.breitbart.com/border/2020/02/12/harsh-weather-leaves-three-migrants-dead-in-california-mountains-near-border/

On Tuesday afternoon, the Reynosa delegate of the CNDH sent a letter to the Tamaulipas governor and others expressing concern in the local case of 23-year-old Juan Daniel Ortiz Martinez who died over the weekend apparently at the hands of police officers.

Ortiz Martinez was an engineer at a manufacturing plant and was driving to a convenience store in a white pickup when a squad of police officers mistook him for a gunman and fired several times. The incident reportedly occurred during a cartel clash. For several days, the area served as a hotspot of violence as rival factions of the Gulf Cartel skirmish with each other and authorities.

Since the shooting, locals began using signs that say, “children on board, don’t shoot,” “family inside,” and other messages to distinguish themselves amid the almost daily shootouts. Vehicles with rear hatches are now seen driving in the open position to clearly indicate that innocent families are passengers.

Since the weekend shooting, the Tamaulipas government revealed the officers allegedly involved are now suspended and face an investigation. Governor Francisco Cabeza de Vaca also issued statements reassuring the public that any officers found to be acting outside of proper procedures or demonstrating abuse of force will be punished.

285,Migrant Family Apprehensions at Border Down 94 Percent from Peak in May,['Bob Price'],"The apprehension of migrant families who illegally cross the border between ports of entry from Mexico into the U.S. fell by 94 percent from the surge’s peak in May 2019. U.S. Customs and Border Protection Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan credits President Donald Trump and his administration’s policies for the dramatic eight-month decline.

The apprehension of Family Unit Aliens (FMUA) by Border Patrol agents along the southwest border with Mexico fell from a peak of 84,486 in May 2019 to only 5,163 in January 2020, according to the Southwest Border Migration Report released by CBP officials on Tuesday. This represents a change in the processing of migrant families from 2,725 per day in May to 167 per day in January.

“The Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCO) — the cartels, the human smuggling organizations — who have shown a complete disregard for the safety of other human beings are exploiting people and violating the laws of our nation,” Commissioner Morgan told reporters during a Tuesday morning press conference. “That is the one commonality in any crisis that we’re facing and any threat that we’re facing in respect to CBP’s duties, roles, and responsibilities.”

“Their actions have resulted in the deaths of thousands of individuals in this country and jeopardized the safety and security of countless more in every town, city, and state in this country.” Morgan explained. “We should be standing together in attacking the individuals who are part what I call these greedy, heartless, and dehumanizing organizations whose only motivation is power and money.”

Morgan said the number of migrant family illegal border crossings increased steadily during FY 2019 peaking in May when Border Patrol agents apprehended more than 84,000.

“There is no question that in 2019 we definitely faced an immigration crisis along our southwest border,” the commissioner stated. “The crisis stemmed from the flow of families from the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. That was really the crux of that immigration crisis — the magnitude we’ve never seen before.”

Morgan blamed the crisis, in part, on the failure of Congress to take action.

“We tried time and time again to ask Congress to help us address the crisis,” Morgan continued. “Time and time again, they failed to take action. They sat back and watched as the threat grew. They still have failed to take any meaningful steps to pass any meaningful legislation to actually positively impact this crisis — to take away the money from these criminal organizations who exploit these migrants.”

Instead, the commissioner said, President Trump and his administration took decisive action leading to the now 94 percent drop in migrant family apprehensions.

“This president has,” he continued. “Where Congress has failed to act, this president has. The president’s network of carefully considered policy initiatives implemented by CBP, ICE, and other partner agencies now apply to nearly 95 percent of aliens who cross the border illegally.”

“We have all but ended catch and release, and make no mistake,” Morgan explained, “these initiatives restored integrity to our immigration system and to laws.”

“If we encounter you, if you are illegally in this country, you will not remain in the United States,” the commissioner stated emphatically. “You will be promptly removed and returned.”

The commissioner said that 95 percent of migrants now face removal, return, or some other legal consequence after illegally crossing the U.S. border.

Morgan said that due to the success of the Trump administration’s network of policies, the cartels responsible for human smuggling are shifting their tactics. So far this fiscal year (which began October 1, 2019) Border Patrol agents apprehended nearly 55,000 single adults from Mexico. This compares to about 150,000 for all of FY 19. The apprehension of Mexican families also is on the rise with 4,425 apprehended in the first quarter of this fiscal year compared to 6,004 for all of FY 19.

He said the smugglers are also enticing Brazillian nationals to make the dangerous journey to the U.S. During FY 19, agents apprehended a record high of 20,000 Brazillian migrants. He said this trend is continuing.

Cartels are also enticing migrants from extra-continental locations like Africa and Asia.

“Since we’ve all but addressed the crisis of the Northern Triangle countries, they’re looking to other vulnerable groups,” the commissioner said. “They’re doing this because we’ve hurt their pocketbooks — significantly.”

“Now we’re seeing more individuals from Mexico,” he continued. “This time last year, about 61 percent of those we were encountering were from the Northern Triangle countries. Now, eight months later, that same percentage, about 61 percent, are actually Mexican nationals and the majority of those are single adults.”

He said the apprehension of single adult Mexican nationals is up 32 percent from this same time last year.

“Let’s be clear and be honest,” Morgan said. “Not everyone trying to illegally enter the United States is good. Not everyone trying to illegally enter the United States is vulnerable. In fact, there are some very dangerous people trying to enter this country illegally every single day with the intent to make their way to every town, city, and state in this country.”

Morgan cited the apprehension of nearly a thousand criminal aliens in just the first four months of this fiscal year. He said those arrested include sexual offenders, violent offenders, human traffickers, and weapons violators. He said agents and officers have also arrested more than 170 gang members this fiscal year. “This is just what we’ve caught,” Mogan said. “There are tens of thousands more that we haven’t caught. That should concern everybody.”

“We’re in a very different place than we were just eight months ago,” the commissioner concluded. “Now, regardless of the numbers, regardless of the demographics, we have the tools, because of this president and because of this administration, to apply a removal, a return, or a consequence to 95 percent of those that CBP are encountering rather than letting them go into the interior of the United States.”

286,Los Zetas Cartel Commander to Face Cop-Killing Charges in Mexican Border State,"['Ildefonso Ortiz', 'Brandon Darby']","A leading commander within a faction of Los Zetas is charged with the murder of five police officers in Tamaulipas. The filings come days after federal attorneys and a judge refused to prosecute him after his arrest at the hands of the Mexican Army.

The new charges were confirmed late Monday by the Tamaulipas government after announcing it would be transferring the feared drug lord to the border state for prosecution. The case began on Friday afternoon when Mexican Army special forces arrested Pablo Cesar “El Takia” Guajardo Alvarez in the Colorines neighborhood of Nuevo Laredo. The 22-year-old was the head of “Estakas” or foot soldiers for the Cartel Del Noreste (CDN) faction of Los Zetas.

Following the arrest, Mexican authorities flew El Takia to Mexico City when a special unit of the Attorney General’s Office (FGR) interrogated him ahead of an anticipated arraignment. Despite seizing several weapons at the time of the arrest, the special prosecutors did not press organized crime charges and a judge ruled there were no elements left to hold him in federal custody. Instead of letting the drug lord be released, Tamaulipas authorities requested extradition for murder charges.

State authorities in Guanajuato placed El Takia in a detention center until the suspect’s transfer is complete. According to the Tamaulipas government, El Takia is linked to the deaths of five employees of the Tamaulipas Attorney General’s Office in 2014.

Breitbart Texas learned the operation targeting El Takia was originally planned after the Mexican Army determined the drug lord was preparing to carry out attacks against military forces in Nuevo Laredo. Los Zetas-CDN have deployed convoys of gunmen in armored SUVs and with .50 caliber machine guns and rifles in their clashes with law enforcement.

287,Migrant Apprehensions at Border Drop 11 Percent in January amid 8-Month Decline,['Bob Price'],"The apprehension of migrants illegally crossing the border between ports of entry fell in January by more than 11 percent as an eight-month decline continues. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials believed in early January that the numbers would increase.

Border Patrol agents apprehended approximately 29,200 migrants who illegally crossed the border between ports of entry in January. This is down 11 percent from December 2019 when agents apprehended 32,858 migrants, a senior CBP official told reporters during a briefing on Monday. From the peak in May 2019 when agents apprehended 132,856 migrants, the number of apprehensions fell by nearly 80 percent.

The current apprehension rate runs at just under 950 per day. This compares to the daily apprehension rate of 4,286 per day in May 2019, according to CBP statistics.

The success of policies put in place by the Trump Administration last summer, Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras provided a regional solution to the problem of mass migration through Mexico to the U.S. border, the official stated.

During a just-ended trip to these countries, Acting CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan met with a wide array of government and law enforcement leaders on topics relating to border security, human trafficking, asylum agreements, reducing illegal migration, and trade opportunities.

“The long-term economic prosperity of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras is vital to addressing the flow of illegal migration to the United States,” Morgan said in a written statement. “We are actively engaged in these partnerships between nations and they are absolutely essential to strengthen our efforts in the U.S. to control our borders and uphold the rule of law. We must also continue to discourage migrants from these nations from risking the lives of their family by making the dangerous and potentially deadly journey north to the United States.”

During the Monday briefing, the CBP official stated these new policies empowered the countries of Mexico and the Central American Northern Triangle to address the mass migration in an effective regional solution.

These new policies forced transnational criminal organizations engaging in human smuggling to shift their tactics and operations.

CBP officials reported a record high of more than 20,000 Brazilian nationals made their way across the U.S. southwestern border during Fiscal Year 2019 (which ended on September 30, 2019). “This trend is continuing in FY20,” the senior CBP official stated. The number of Mexican nationals apprehended at the border is also increasing.

CBP says it is now applying a legal consequence to 95 percent of those who illegally cross the border — “all but ending the catch and release” policies of the past. Those consequences include removal to Mexico and Guatemala under the Migrant Protection Program, prosecution for illegal entry into the U.S., increased prosecution for those who re-enter after being removed, the return of Mexican migrants deep into the Mexican interior instead of just across the border, and other consequences.

As to the reports of migrant caravans forming in Honduras, the CBP official responded, “Do not put yourself or your family at risk by embarking on this dangerous journey.”

“We are encouraged by the January apprehension numbers,” the CBP official concluded. “Our efforts have been undeniably successful.”

The official release of the January apprehension numbers in the Southwest Border Migration Report is slated for 10 a.m. on Tuesday morning. That report will include a breakdown of family units, unaccompanied minors, and single adult migrants. It will also include details about apprehensions by sector and countries of origin of the apprehended migrants.",https://www.breitbart.com/border/2020/02/11/migrant-apprehensions-at-border-drop-11-percent-in-january-amid-8-month-decline/
288,"U.S. Border Seizures of Meth, Fentanyl Set to Break Records in 2020",['Jaeson Jones'],"U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data provide insight into cartels’ most recent shift in narcotics smuggling and their impacts on American citizens in 2020. The data show an increase in seizures of methamphetamine and fentanyl along the U.S.-Mexico Border.

Data provided from the CBP Office of Field Operations (OFO) clearly shows a dramatic surge in methamphetamine seizures at the nation’s ports of entry during the first three months of Fiscal Year 2020. Officers seized 40,882 pounds in total. This is significant, considering in all of FY 2019, the agency seized 68,858 pounds — the most ever recorded in a single year. Fentanyl seizures in all Fiscal Year 2019 were the highest-ever recorded as well at 2,545 pounds. During the first three months of FY 2020, officers seized 530 pounds.

U.S. Border Patrol, which operates between ports of entry in an uncontrolled environment, also observed a record surge in meth and fentanyl. During the first three months of FY 2020, agents seized 4,158 pounds of meth. This is also significant considering that in all of FY 2019, the agency seized an annual record — 14,434 pounds. Additionally, fentanyl seizures in all of Fiscal Year 2018 were the highest-ever at 388 pounds. In the first three months of FY 2020, Border Patrol agents seized 139 pounds. This year, Border Patrol is on the path to more hard drugs than ever before in the agency’s history.

Table, U.S. Customs and Border Protection

These data may serve as a significant tripwire for the White House, executive leadership of the DEA, and the Office of National Drug Control Policy by marking another flashpoint between the U.S. and Mexican cartels.

On January 30, 2020, DEA released its annual 2019 Drug Threat Assessment Report. The data, however, largely reflect actions in 2017. However, the report notes that roughly 192 people died every day from drug poisoning in the U.S. during President Donald Trump’s first year in office. Since that time, seizure data from elsewhere regarding methamphetamine and fentanyl have exhibited dramatic increases year over year.

Why is this occurring?

The answer is two-fold. First, Mexican cartels are seeing ratcheting demand for narcotics like methamphetamine, fentanyl, or the combination of both known as “super meth.” Cartels are wasting no time in adjusting to the market as marijuana access laws loosen among U.S. states.

The second reason is due to the cost of a cartel war. Historically, one or two major regional conflicts could occur between factions. Today, we are witnessing something comparable to a world war. Virtually all territories, routes, and products are currently being contested. At the same time, Mexico City has undergone its traditional reshuffling of the security apparatus while recently adopting a policy of de-militarization. Related casualties are worse now than ever since record-keeping began.

The cost overhead of a cartel war pushes them to move more product, be it drugs, people, or fuel. Naturally, the spike in volume through contested areas can only engender more bloodshed. This vicious cycle reached the point in December 2019–shortly before the Christmas travel season–for the U.S. State Department to renew its travel warning for 16 of the 32 states in Mexico.

289,Two Convicted Sex Offenders Arrested Crossing Border into California,['Bob Price'],"El Centro Sector Border Patrol agents apprehended two previously deported sex offenders as they attempted to make their way into California over the weekend. The arrests happened in separate incidents east and west of the Calexico West Downtown Port of Entry.

El Centro Station Border Patrol agents encountered a man they believed had just illegally crossed the border from Mexicali, Mexico, into the U.S. The agents apprehended the man approximately 3 miles west of the Calexico West Downtown Port of Entry shortly after noon on Friday, according to information obtained from El Centro Sector Border Patrol officials.

The agents transported the migrant to the El Centro Station for processing and a biometric background investigation. During processing, the agents identified the man as 52-year-old Ricardo Saucedo-Hernandez, a Mexican national.

A criminal records check revealed that a court in Perris, California, convicted the man in April 2003 for “Annoying or Molesting a Child Under 18,” officials stated. The court sentenced the Mexican man to 120 days in jail and a fine. An immigration judge previously ordered Saucedo removed from the U.S. on September 11, 2017.

On Sunday morning, shortly after midnight, agents assigned to the Calexico Station encountered another man they believed to have entered the U.S. illegally. The agents placed him in custody approximately 16 miles east of the Calexico West Downtown Port of Entry, officials reported. The agents transported the migrant to the El Centro Station for processing.

During a biometric background investigation, the agents identified the man as 37-year-old Armando Valenzuela-Salazar, also a Mexican national. During a search of the man’s criminal history, the agents found that a Greenville, North Carolina, court convicted Valenzuela in 2011 for “Sexual Battery,” officials stated. The court sentenced him to 50 days in jail.

An immigration judge ordered that he be removed from the U.S. on March 14, 2011.

Both subjects are being held pending prosecution for immigration violations.

290,Expert: Venezuelan Oil Production Currently at 1945 Levels,['Ben Kew'],"The oil-rich nation of Venezuela is producing its lowest output of oil in 75 years, according to the petroleum economist and professor at the prestigious Central University of Venezuela Rafael Quiroz.

In an interview with El Impulso, Quiroz revealed the result of a recent analysis of Venezuela’s six largest oil refineries, all owned by the state-run oil company Petroleum of Venezuela (PDSVA), that found them capable of producing 1,300,000 barrels of oil every day.

The refineries – located in Amuay, Cardón, Bajo Grande, El Palito, Puerto La Cruz and San Roque – are currently producing just 8.5 percent of that capacity.

Barely 205,000 barrels of engine oil, grease, diesel, gasoline and fuel oil are currently being produced every day, forcing Nicolás Maduro’s socialist regime to import fuel from allies such as Russia and China to meet nationwide demand.

The situation worsened last week when the refineries of the Paraguaná Refining Center (Amuay, Cardón, and Bajo) came to a standstill. Of those three, Amuay currently has an output of five percent of its total capacity, equivalent to around 34,000 barrels per day (bpd).

With output now at 205,000 bpd nationwide, the PDSVA’s output has now fallen to levels last seen in 1945 when Isaías Medina Angarita was president. The company also now own has seven operating ships and 26 drills, severely limiting the speed at which oil can be extracted.

Furthermore, the PDSVA currently has outstanding debts of $85 billion, for which Russia and China are the only the providers receiving some form of reimbursement. Payments to outsourced national and international companies (suppliers, drilling service providers and others) have been suspended indefinitely.

The company’s demise can be traced back to the rise of socialist dictator Hugo Chávez, who nationalized PDSVA before putting it in the hands of inexperienced socialist allies, leading to chronic efficiencies. This, combined with the exodus of experienced employees, has crippled the country’s oil output.

According to Quiroz, PDSVA would need an investment of around $250 billion over the next ten years in order to turn things around and return to the 3.2 million bpd that the company was producing when Chávez took power in 1998.

Despite having the second-largest oil reserves in the world after the United States, shortages of gasoline have in recent years become part and parcel of life for ordinary Venezuelans. Last month, motorists in the capital of Caracas, a city whose oil shipments are usually prioritized, rang in the new year with widespread gasoline shortages because the PDSVA failed to distribute supplies to fuel stations on time.

Since March last year, Venezuelans have also faced repeated power cuts that have crippled its basic ability to function, forcing the closure of schools, hospitals, and other essential public services. Maduro has repeatedly blamed the blackouts on a supposed U.S.-led attack on the country’s electrical grid aimed at weakening his authority, although he has never provided any evidence for such claims.

291,"Amy Klobuchar Can’t Name President of Mexico, Despite Voting for USMCA",['Joel B. Pollak'],"Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) could not name the president of Mexico when asked to do so by a Telemundo reporter in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Thursday evening.

Earlier this year, Klobuchar voted for the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in the Senate, noting the importance of Mexico to the U.S. economy:

Canada and Mexico are Minnesota’s two biggest trading partners, and I recently voted to approve the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) on trade. I supported USMCA since, with the additionally negotiated pro-labor and environmental changes, as well as the elimination of a provision that would have benefitted pharmaceutical companies at the expense of consumers, I felt the agreement provided much needed stability and economic opportunity for American farmers, producers, and consumers. A North American trading bloc is also an essential strategy to competing with China on a global scale.

However, when quizzed by Telemundo, she could not remember the name of Mexico’s president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (or AMLO, as he is colloquially known).

Klobuchar was interviewed by Telemundo following Thursday night’s League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) presidential forum, which Breitbart News covered.

Billionaire left-wing donor Tom Steyer also attended, as did former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) addressed the forum on video.

As the AFP reported, neither Klobuchar nor Steyer came up with the right answer, and Buttigieg seemed uncertain:

“I forgot,” said billionaire Steyer, when asked if he could name Mexico’s president. “No,” admitted Klobuchar, a senator from Minnesota. Showing them up was Pete Buttigieg, the former South Bend, Indiana mayor and youngest of the eight candidates battling for the Democratic presidential nomination. “Lopez Obrador… I hope,” he answered, hesitatingly.

Recent polls show that Democrats are locked in a tight race in Nevada ahead of the caucuses on Feb. 22.

The UNITE HERE Local 226 Culinary Workers’ Union, one of the most powerful in the state, declined to endorse any particular candidate on Thursday, leaving the race in limbo.

292,Poll: Majority of Venezuelans Trust Neither Maduro nor Guaidó,['Frances Martel'],"A survey published this week by the Venezuelan polling firm Meganálisis found that the majority of Venezuelans want dictator Nicolás Maduro to leave power, but also have no trust in President Juan Guaidó to save the country from the socialism-driven humanitarian crisis it is now in.

Guaidó returned from a world tour this week that included stops throughout the United States, most prominently his guest appearance at President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address. The tour was of great symbolic importance because the Maduro regime banned Guaidó from leaving the country.

Maduro is currently actively governing Venezuela, though he has no constitutional power to do so. Maduro maintains control of the military and claims legitimacy through a fraudulent election held in May 2018. As Maduro’s legal term ended in January 2019, the National Assembly, the federal legislature, used its constitutional power to appoint a legitimate president, giving the title to Juan Guaidó.

While most of the Western Hemisphere and the free world generally considers Guaidó the president of Venezuela, Maduro’s stranglehold on the military has prevented him from exercising his power within his country. Guaidó has thus resorted to using diplomatic presidential powers abroad.

Meganálisis found popular distaste for both leaders.

Asked if they would like to see an end to Maduro’s regime and “chavismo,” the cult of personality around late dictator Hugo Chávez, 79.9 percent of respondents said yes. About an equal amount of people – 10.4 percent to 9.6 percent – said no and that they didn’t know, respectively.

While a less dramatic negative response, the plurality of those surveyed also said they did not trust President Guaidó.

Asked, “After the events of the past year, do you still believe, trust, and support Juan Guaidó?”, 63.8 percent of respondents said “no.”

More people said “I never believed in him” – 12.1 percent – than those who said they still believed, 10.7 percent.

Another 13.3 percent said, “I don’t know.”

These dire numbers are actually significantly better for Guaidó than what Meganálisis found in its December polling. Two months ago, 68.5 percent of people said they did not trust Guaidó anymore and slightly more people, 12.9 percent, said they never did. A smaller number of people, 10.3 percent, also said then that they still trusted the president.

The number of people who wanted an end to chavismo was also higher two months ago, actually suggesting a mild increase in hope on both sides in the past two months, not any significant chance of opinion that benefits Maduro at the expense of Guaidó or vice versa.

In November, 86.6 percent said they wanted Maduro to leave, while only 8.9 percent said no.

Much of the disappointment with Guaidó stems from the president agreeing to a series of “talks” with Maduro amid thousands-strong protests, just as it appeared Maduro might fall last year. Some also disagree with Guaidó’s politics; like Maduro, he is a socialist and was a member of the socialist Popular Will party until this year. Shortly after becoming president, he revealed a sprawling initiative to save the country he branded the “Plan País,” or “Country Plan,” which sought to save Venezuela through handing out large government subsidies and expanding nationalization of the oil industry – essentially the same proposal Hugo Chávez won election to the presidency with, but, Guaidó promised, done right.

Venezuelans also appear to have little hope in Guaidó’s world tour benefitting them in any way. The survey asked respondents if they expected “benefits for the country” from the world tour; 75.1 percent said no.

La mayoría (75.1%) de los venezolanos, no espera beneficios para el país producto de la gira de Guaidó.

Other highlights in the poll are that the plurality of those polled said they would not vote in elections for a new National Assembly – a sign of lack of faith in Venezuela’s institutions – and over 80 percent of those polled said they were not aware of any humanitarian aid offered to Venezuelans by international organizations, including the United Nations.

Infrastructure in Venezuela is also collapsing, a reality extensively reported that the poll confirmed. Asked if they have daily, reliable access to water, 82.7 percent of respondents said no. Electricity access was slightly higher – 78.5 percent of those asked said that the reliability and quality of electricity in their homes was either “terrible” or “irregular.” Notably, the vast majority of those who said they had reliable access to electricity were in Caracas and wealthy Miranda state. Of those who said they have access to electricity, 0.2 percent of them lived in 20 of 24 Venezuelan states; the other 99.8 percent lived in the capital, Miranda, Aragua, and Carabobo, all states surrounding Caracas.

Meganálisis polled 1,480 people in all of Venezuela’s 24 states between January 23 and February 7.

The disillusion with the country’s leaders follows months of intense power struggles that have had little impact on the daily lives of Venezuelans. Those struggles peaked this week as Guaidó arrived home, greeted at Maiquetía, one of the country’s last remaining functional airports, by a violent mob of socialists who proceeded to attempt to beat him and his family, throw projectiles and spill liquids on him, tear his dress shirt, and destroy cameras and other journalistic equipment. Police also swiftly arrested Guaidó’s uncle, Juan José Márquez, in the chaos created by the Maduro-organized socialist mob.

Guaidó and his family only learned of what happened to Márquez, who disappeared at the airport, on the television program Con el mazo dando (“Hitting with the Mallet”), hosted by Maduro henchman and socialist party leader Diosdado Cabello. Cabello claimed that Márquez broke the law by wearing a bulletproof vest on the flight into Venezuela and carrying a brochure about life and religion in Israel. He also claimed that Márquez possessed a flashlight full of C-4 explosives.

293,"Venezuela Sues U.S.: 'Crimes Against Humanity', Compares to Holocaust",['Frances Martel'],"Venezuela’s socialist dictatorship lodged a formal protest against the United States on Thursday at the International Criminal Court (ICC), asking The Hague to formally investigate Washington for “crimes against humanity.”

The International Criminal Court is a legal venue that can find both individuals and nations guilty under universal human rights laws and is typically used to prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity such as genocide, or widespread use of torture, rape, forced abortions, sterilization, and other measures to silence minorities or political dissidents.

The Maduro regime, which is not legally in control of Venezuela, is accusing America of crimes against humanity for enacting economic sanctions.

The administration of President Donald Trump has greatly extended sanctions to cover senior members of the Maduro regime and has imposed sanctions on Venezuela’s state-run oil industry and other sources of revenue. The sanctions are a response to egregious human rights crimes committed by the Maduro regime, including the imprisonment, torture, and killing of political dissidents. Venezuela is also living the worst humanitarian crisis in its history, sending millions into exile and forcing those in the country to scavenge for food in trash, as a result of Maduro’s socialist price controls and other economic policies.

Maduro is not the president of Venezuela as of January 2019, when his term ended. He retains control of the Venezuelan military, however, which mounting evidence indicates functions as a personal drug cartel for the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV). The current president of Venezuela is Juan Guaidó, constitutionally appointed after Maduro’s term ended.

Maduro’s “foreign minister,” Jorge Arreaza, traveled to The Hague this week to demand a formal inquiry into alleged “crimes against humanity” by the United States. Arreaza, son-in-law to late dictator Hugo Chávez, described economic sanctions as “weapons of mass destruction” and compared U.S. policy against Maduro to the Holocaust.

“They are weapons of mass destruction and only with multilateralism, fully activated and on the offensive against illegality, can we stop them,” he told the ICC. “Not only will the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela do it with its capacity for resilience, but the multilateral system, coordinated states should detain the barbarity. The only empire that should exist is the empire of law.”

The sanctions, Arreaza reportedly said, “are like the persecution of the Jewish people during the Holocaust or the persecution of the Palestinian people.”

Venezuela’s foreign ministry described the term “sanctions” for economic bans on human rights violators using American infrastructure to profit or sell goods in America as a “euphemism.” Maduro’s regime called the denunciation at the ICC a “historic moment” that needs to be addressed “urgently.”

The Trump administration has systematically imposed sanctions on Maduro’s Caracas elite, which continue to live in luxury while the majority of the nation struggles to eat. A poll released this week by the Venezuelan firm Meganálisis found that 78.5 percent of Venezuelans have either “irregular” or “poor” access to electricity; of those who had consistent, reliable electricity, only 0.2 percent resided outside of Caracas and its neighboring wealthy states. Another 82.7 percent of people said they did not have reliable access to water.

To keep money out of the hands of the Maduro regime, noting its illegitimacy as a real government, the Trump administration has sanctioned its top sources of revenue. On the top of that list is Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), the state-run oil company, which Washington sanctioned last year. Other sanctions have targeted individuals known to engage in or support the use of torture and extrajudicial killing of political dissidents – banning them from the United States and cutting their access to American banks and businesses – and freezing the U.S.-based assets of the Maduro regime itself.

The United States has also sanctioned members of Nicolás Maduro’s family for using emergency food funds to profit personally, keeping much-needed humanitarian aid out of the hands of Venezuelans. Maduro has so succeeded in keeping food out of the hands of Venezuelans, and the Meganálisis poll found that over 80 percent of those asked were not aware of any international programs offering food aid to the country.

This week, the Trump administration sanctioned Conviasa, the Maduro regime’s state airline.

While Arreaza demands an investigation into the United States, the Maduro regime is facing its own accusation of crimes against humanity. Six Western Hemisphere states – Argentina, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, and Peru – sued the regime at the ICC in 2018 for crimes against humanity. Among the accusations are claims of the use of military force to kill and injure dissidents, the use of torture in political prisons, and the denial of food aid and other necessities to those who do not vocally support Maduro.

The Maduro regime has consistently blamed the United States – first the administration of Barack Obama, now that of President Trump – for the death, violence, and starvation plaguing the country.

294,Venezuela: Maduro Arrests President Guaidó's Uncle,['Frances Martel'],"The socialist regime of Nicolás Maduro confirmed the arrest of Juan José Márquez, President Juan Guaidó’s uncle, late Wednesday, accusing him of smuggling illicit items into Venezuela like C-4 explosives and a brochure on culture and religion in Israel.

Márquez was on a flight from Portugal to Venezuela’s Maiquetía airport on Tuesday alongside his nephew and walked out of the gate with the Guaidó team. The Maduro regime organized a violent mob to greet Guaidó upon his return that pelted Guaidó and his family with projectiles, pour liquids on the president, and beat journalists in broad daylight. In the ensuing melee, Guaidó later told the media, Márquez disappeared.

Guaidó has been interim president of Venezuela since January 2019, when Maduro’s term expired. Maduro claims legitimacy as head of state through a May 2018 presidential “election” in which he banned all non-Marxist candidates, used violence to force Venezuelans to vote for him, and still managed record low turnout. In the event of a “break in the democratic order,” the lawmakers of the National Assembly can constitutionally replace a would-be dictator with an interim president, which is the process that granted Guaidó the presidency.

Guaidó returned to Venezuela this week after a world tour that included stops in Washington and Miami. In the former, Guaidó attended President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address as an invited guest and received a standing ovation as Venezuela’s legitimate head of state.

On Tuesday evening, Guaidó denounced the illegitimate Maduro regime for disappearing his uncle.

“24 hours disappeared. I hold you responsible, usurper Nicolás Maduro, and each and every one of your henchmen in Maiquetía for whatever happens to Juan José Márquez,” Guaidó wrote on Twitter, “an honest and brave man who knows better than anyone the courage of this struggle and his only concern is worrying about his family.”

24 horas desaparecido. Te hago responsable, usurpador Nicolás Maduro, y a cada uno de tus esbirros en Maiquetía de lo que le pase a Juan José Márquez, un hombre honesto y valiente que conoce como nadie el valor de esta lucha y su único problema es preocuparse por su familia https://t.co/sLsLHf5TBb — Juan Guaidó (@jguaido) February 12, 2020

The public has not had an opportunity to see Márquez or confirm his wellbeing at press time, but Diosdado Cabello – head of Maduro’s United Socialist Party (PSUV), U.S.-sanctioned drug lord, and variety TV show host – confirmed the arrest late Wednesday.

“They’re making a bunch of noise about that they arrested an uncle of Guaidó’s,” Cabello said on Wednesday’s broadcast of his television show, Con el mazo dando (“Hitting with the Mallet”). “Not arrested – forced disappearance! I have some news … this uncle … had very dangerous materials on the plane. He violated the norms of civil aviation.”

Among the allegedly illegal items Cabello accused Márquez of carrying were a bulletproof vest and a brochure detailing life and religion in Israel.

The Maduro regime has close ties to the Shia terrorist group Hezbollah and the virulently antisemitic Islamic regime of Iran. Maduro himself has repeatedly condemned Israel for alleged transgressions against Palestinians and attended the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) conference in 2017, at the behest of Islamist Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Cabello also claimed that Márquez had smuggled in an English-language document containing an unspecified anti-Venezuelan plan and had the contact information of an American Secret Service agent on his mobile phone.

The socialist television personality and drug trafficker’s main accusation, however, was that Márquez was smuggling explosives into Venezuela from Portugal.

“He brought tactical flashlights that included inside of them, in their battery compartment, chemical substances of an explosive nature. Presumably, C-4 explosive material,” Cabello claimed. “This is not a lie. This gentleman was bringing that. What else what this man bringing? A manual from Israel where it specifies its culture and religious beliefs … perfume capsules that contained explosive materials, presumably C-4. So what do we do, that he is the uncle of [Guaidó] we have to release him? No.”

The evidence Cabello presented consisted entirely in printed out images of, among other things, what appeared to be an Israeli tourism brochure, a bulletproof vest, and a flashlight.

Cabello then announced that Maduro would seek to take legal action against TAP Air Portugal, the airline Márquez flew to Venezuela on.

“When you look at the passenger list, nowhere there did it say any Juan Geraldo Guaidó Márquez [sic],” Cabello shouted. “The Portuguese think that we are pendejos [roughly, ‘assholes’]. … They think we are third-worlders, they call us, and they are a kingdom. Remember the Portuguese kingdom? They still think that.”

Cabello also disparaged Guaidó’s legitimacy.

“Who the hell is that guy? A guy who goes around the world saying he is the president of Venezuela,” Cabello ranted. “Who elected him president of Venezuela?”

Márquez, the Spanish newspaper El País reported, is a pilot by trade and family say he has no criminal background.

“My husband is a family man, a worker with no police background, that is why I am sure that he will be freed,” his wife Romina Bottaro told reporters.

Guaidó has attempted to galvanize the international press against the violent assault his family and journalists faced upon returning home.

“We will see the dictatorship’s response, the brutal, savage aggression yesterday to journalists, to members of the press, to lawmakers – we saw how they blocked highways, the National Guard posted on the street to even block foot traffic,” he told reporters Wednesday. “None of that will ever stop us nor has it ever stopped us. We will also see the increase of diplomatic pressure, that pressure, too, against human rights violators and financial criminals on the part of Nicolás Maduro.”

Trump promised Guaidó support during his address to Congress this month.

“Here this evening is a man who carries with him the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of all Venezuelans. Joining us in the gallery is the true and legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaidó,” Trump said as Congress offered Guaidó a standing ovation. “Mr. President, please take this message back to your homeland: All Americans are united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom! Socialism destroys nations. But always remember, freedom unifies the soul.”

295,Video: Socialist Mob Assaults President Juan Guaidó,['Frances Martel'],"Venezuelan President Juan Guaidó returned to his country on Tuesday after a world tour that included stops in America and Europe and was greeted by a mob organized by dictator Nicolás Maduro, which proceeded to pelt him with trash, douse him in water, and attempt to beat his wife.

The mob, many of them wearing t-shirts featuring the face of late dictator Hugo Chávez or other socialist insignia, organized outside of the gate where Guaidó arrived in the Maiquetía airport Tuesday afternoon, making it difficult for him and his team to pass through the airport.

The mob also assaulted several independent journalists who had congregated at the gate to record their attack on Guaidó and first lady Fabiana Rosales. Guaidó’s team later reported that his uncle Juan José Márquez, who had accompanied the president on his flight back from Portugal, went missing in the ensuing chaos.

Videos by Venezuelan journalists and onlookers reveal that Guaidó managed to pass through customs with minimal incident, but a woman attacked him as he left, dousing him in a liquid apparently from a can. One video shows the woman shouting unintelligibly while doing so as others shout “disgrace!” at Guaidó. Guaidó, resigned, mumbles, “This is the show today, this is the little show.”

Following the initial attack, the mob formed around Guaidó, Rosales, and their friends and family who had arrived at the airport. The mob managed to shove Guaidó and throw rocks and other objects at him but did not cause any significant harm. Others in the scrum do appear to come to blows.

Venezuelan journalists later identified many of the members of the mob to be employees of the airline Conviasa, one of the few businesses Maduro’s regime continues to run, which the United States recently sanctioned for enriching the illegitimate socialist regime. The woman who initially attacked Guaidó was identified as Dubraska Padrón, the airline’s “political coordinator.” Videos surfacing of the event later showed that a senior officer at the Maiquetía airport deliberately allowed Padrón into the restricted area where Guaidó was concluding his registration with customs upon arriving to facilitate the attack.

Many of the members of the mob were also identified as Maduro’s socialist agitators and leveled their ire at the press as well as the president’s team. According to the Venezuelan network NTN24, the mob assaulted at least four independent journalists, stealing their shoes, punching them, and trying to destroy their equipment. The outlet identifies one of those journalists, Maiker Yriarte, as having received a “brutal beating.” The mob shouted insults at journalists tying them with the United States, calling them “paid off by the Empire,” the generic term leftist regimes use for America.

After safely escaping the melee, Guaidó posted a photo on Twitter of his processing at the airport with the caption, “HOME.”

Guaidó became president of Venezuela in January 2019, after Maduro’s last legal term expired. Maduro claims legitimacy as head of state through a fraudulent election that occurred in May 2018, in which he banned all non-Marxist candidates from running and the opposition led a boycott resulting in record-low turnout. The Venezuelan constitution allows the federal legislature, the National Assembly, to replace a president in the event of a “rupture in the democratic order,” meaning if a president refuses to leave when his term ends. The National Assembly chose its president, Guaidó, to fill the interim presidency, tasked with organizing free and fair elections as soon as possible.

Guaidó is legally the president of Venezuela and has used his power to appoint envoys in the dozens of countries that recognize his legitimacy, but has not been able to exercise his power as commander-in-chief, as Maduro refuses to yield control of the military. Under Chávez and, later, Maduro, much of the Venezuelan military is believed to be involved in cocaine trafficking, a lucrative industry in a nation where millions struggle to find sources of food for three meals a day.

The National Assembly published an alert on Tuesday about the disappearance of Márquez, Guaidó’s uncle. Márquez was apparently with the president and his family upon walking out of the plane and into the gate. Those with him did not see him at any time leave, but could not find him once they overcame the socialist mob. The Assembly warned that the Maduro regime had likely abducted him.

Guaidó appeared before the National Assembly building on Wednesday denouncing the “savage” aggression against himself and his family and directly accusing Maduro of having organized it.

“It is a clear escalation on the part of the dictatorship,” Guaidó asserted on Wednesday. “It is the permissiveness of the armed forces that allows this. Just because they don’t want to be involved or they leave the repression to third parties does not mean they are not responsible.”

Guaidó then once again demanded the Venezuelan people take to the streets for peaceful protests, which have been happening on and off since 2013 and have failed to remove Maduro.

Maduro himself has not responded to Guaidó’s arrival at press time, but deployed his socialist party leader and television pundit Diosdado Cabello to do the honors.

“He mess with the wrong people, the people will wait for him anywhere he goes,” Cabello said before the “national constituent assembly,” an illegal parallel legislature Maduro created to siphon power away from the National Assembly. “They are so immoral that they said there were people disguised as Conviasa workers.”

The videos of the incident clearly show people dressed in Conviasa uniforms.

Cabello also threatened that Guaidó could be hurt or killed at any given moment.

“He hangs out with delinquents, with drug traffickers, and with paramilitaries … who can say what will happen? Nobody,” Cabello said, adding that “sooner or later” he would “face justice.”

The U.S. government has identified Cabello as one of Venezuela’s most prominent drug traffickers and sanctioned him for profiting from the narcotics trade. Law enforcement sources have identified Cabello as the head of the Cartel de los Soles, a cocaine trafficking operation run by members of the Venezuelan military.

296,Pope Francis Says ‘No’ to Married Priests in Amazon Region,['Thomas D. Williams'],"ROME — Pope Francis has denied appeals from a recent Vatican synod of bishops that suitable married men be ordained to the Catholic priesthood.

Last October, the synod released its final document in which participating bishops requested that the pope allow the ordination of married men, a request addressed by Francis in a long-awaited teaching letter called Querida Amazonia (Dear Amazonia), published Wednesday.

“Many of the ecclesial communities of the Amazonian territory have enormous difficulties in accessing the Eucharist,” the synod document stated, noting that some communities in the region can go for months, even years between visits from a priest.

While saying they appreciate priestly celibacy “as a gift of God,” the bishops declared that “legitimate diversity does not harm the communion and unity of the Church, but expresses and serves it.”

The synod fathers proposed the establishment of a process “to ordain as priests suitable and esteemed men of the community, who have had a fruitful permanent diaconate and receive an adequate formation for the priesthood, having a legitimately constituted and stable family, to sustain the life of the Christian community.”

In Wednesday’s letter, called an apostolic exhortation, the pope offered reasons for denying the bishops’ request, which had stirred up both hopes and concerns in different sectors of the Church.

“Priests are necessary, but this does not mean that permanent deacons (of whom there should be many more in the Amazon region), religious women and lay persons cannot regularly assume important responsibilities for the growth of communities, and perform those functions ever more effectively with the aid of a suitable accompaniment,” Francis said.

“Consequently, it is not simply a question of facilitating a greater presence of ordained ministers who can celebrate the Eucharist,” he said in a key passage, adding that such “would be a very narrow aim.”

Instead, the pope proposes that the Church in the Amazonian region “requires the stable presence of mature and lay leaders endowed with authority and familiar with the languages, cultures, spiritual experience and communal way of life in the different places, but also open to the multiplicity of gifts that the Holy Spirit bestows on every one.”

“For wherever there is a particular need, he has already poured out the charisms that can meet it,” he added. “This requires the Church to be open to the Spirit’s boldness, to trust in, and concretely to permit, the growth of a specific ecclesial culture that is distinctively lay.”

Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI and Guinean Cardinal Robert Sarah underscored the importance of maintaining Church discipline regarding priestly celibacy in a recent book titled From the Depths of Our Hearts: Priesthood, Celibacy and the Crisis of the Catholic Church.

The timing of the book’s publication suggested to some that the two prelates were hoping to influence Francis’ decision in the matter.

297,Cuban State Media Suggests Coronavirus Is U.S. ‘Bioterrorism’,['Frances Martel'],"Granma, the official state newspaper of the Communist Party of Cuba, floated “hypothesis” in a column published last week that the ongoing coronavirus outbreak in China is the result of American “biological terrorism” intended to hurt the Chinese economy.

The Spain-based Diario de Cuba newspaper highlighted the column, which cited an alleged Spanish journalist whose sole evidence for the theory was a remark from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that an ongoing health emergency in China might force companies to do more business with America. The newspaper also noted Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s repeated warnings that the Chinese Communist Party is a threat to global freedom and democracy as somehow indicating that Washington is engaging in terrorist activity.

Orfilio Peláez, the Granma “journalist” responsible for promoting the theory, wrote that the Spanish conspiracy theory in question posits that “the coronavirus could be a germ created in laboratories in the United States as a biological weapon of economic war unleashed by Washington against China.” The piece goes on to offer no evidence that the Pentagon had been working on any such weapon in recent memory or research on the novel coronavirus suggesting it did not occur in nature. Instead, it offered “various recent declarations by high-ranking White House officials and an increasingly intense international anti-China media campaign” as proof.

“I think it will help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America. Some to U.S., probably some to Mexico as well,’’ Commerce Secretary Ross said on television of the coronavirus outbreak in January, a remark that Granma posited could indicate biological terrorism.

Drifting away from the material in the alleged Spanish blog post that the flagship Cuban government newspaper based its initial story on, Peláez then redirected attention to Cuba by claiming that late dictator Fidel Castro was the first “victim” of American biological warfare.

“Perhaps one of the intended first victims of this dark mode of aggression was Commander in Chief Fidel Castro at the beginning of the Revolution, when the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) designed a plan to contaminate a scuba suit that would supposedly be used by the Cuban leader,” Granma alleged. There is no evidence that the CIA ever executed this alleged plan.

Granma also revived the many colorful theories of the CIA allegedly trying to poison Fidel Castro with cigars, without attempting to link these stories to the Chinese coronavirus outbreak of 2020 in any way.

After an extensive discussion of alleged CIA bioterrorism activities, the Granma articled concluded: “there is no evidence at this time that the coronavirus is part of a biological terrorist act by the United States.”

Chinese scientists identified the virus responsible for the current outbreak as a yet-unidentified form of coronavirus dubbed 2019-nCoV to distinguish it from other coronaviruses: the common cold, the virus responsible for Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and others, most which cause respiratory illness. The novel coronavirus prompts fever, difficulty breathing, and other flu-like symptoms in carriers. It can lead to pneumonia or death.

The virus originated in Wuhan, a city of 11 million in central China. Experts believe it entered the first human carrier through exposure to or consumption of game at a wild meat market in the city. Wuhan Communist Party authorities shut the market down on January 1, nearly a month before they decided to warn the public of a highly contagious, deadly disease.

The Cuban conspiracy theory surrounding the virus is far from the last, and not the only one blaming America. Russian television has floated the idea that America is trying to sink both the Russian and Chinese economies by deploying an alleged biological weapon. Channel One, a national broadcast network, aired a conspiracy theory contending that the presence of the word “corona” in the name of the virus – “crown” in many languages, including Russian – is a nod to President Donald Trump’s time as a beauty pageant owner. It did not address the fact that the common cold is also a coronavirus and that the name existed long before Trump took office, but did give time to an “expert” contending that the virus could not have been created in nature, according to the BBC translation of the broadcast.

Another Russian outlet, the state online publication Zvezda, reportedly published an article in January linking the virus to trade talks between Washington and Beijing.",https://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/02/11/cuban-state-media-suggests-coronavirus-is-u-s-bioterrorism/
298,Cuban Regime Tells Top Dissident Leader to Choose: Exile or Prison,['Frances Martel'],"Cuban police told the 17-year-old son of José Daniel Ferrer, the head of Cuba’s largest dissident group, to relay to his imprisoned father that his only chance at freedom is to leave the country, the younger Ferrer said on Monday.

Police arrested the younger Ferrer, known as “Danielito,” and Ferrer’s wife Nelva Ortega on Sunday. Both, as well as two younger siblings of Danielito’s – the youngest seven months old – have regularly faced arrest for publicly protesting Ferrer’s detention.

Ferrer is the head of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), a dissident organization with a large presence throughout the island. He disappeared in October abruptly, only to resurface weeks later facing charges that could land him up to nine years in prison. Police have offered no evidence that Ferrer has committed any crime outside of demanding democracy on the island.

Cuban Prisoners Defenders, an advocacy group for imprisoned political dissidents, revealed the threat of exile in a press release Monday, based on testimony by Ferrer’s son. According to the group, police detained Danielito early on Sunday, as well as his stepmother, who was forced to leave her infant with his grandmother to avoid exposing the baby to jail yet again. Police split the family during the detention.

“José Daniel Ferrer, Jr. (Danielito) was arrested by the political police yesterday to transmit to his father the regime’s offer that ‘if he leaves the country he would not be convicted,'” Cuban Prisoners Defenders confirmed in a statement to the press, and continued: ”

Danielito and Nelva Ismarays Ortega [and] the youngest son of José Daniel Ferrer, were arrested when they left yesterday morning their home, located at the top of the UNPACU headquarters. Danielito’s detention lasted 5 hours, in which the political police tried to get him to visit his father to offer him to leave the country in exchange for his freedom. The son refused to do so and hours later he was released.

The group quoted Ferrer’s sister, Ana Belkis Ferrer, who said that she had heard from others in UNPACU that Danielito was released after five hours in custody in which they urged the minor to pressure his father to flee the country.

Ferrer also posted news of the arrest online, confirming that the arrests occurred on Sunday morning as they left the UNPACU headquarters in eastern Santiago de Cuba.

En la mañana de ayer, Domingo 9 de Febrero del 2020, sicarios castristas detuvieron a mi sobrino José Daniel Ferrer Cantillo de 17 años de edad y a Nelva Ismarays Ortega Tamayo, hijo y esposa de mi hermano José Daniel Ferrer Garcia, cuando salían de la sede. @MarioDB @marcorubio pic.twitter.com/NSANYnAlpG — Ana Belkis Ferrer G. (@anabelkisfg) February 10, 2020

“They told me that they are going to confiscate everything in the UNPACU headquarters, that there was not going to be any more activism there,” Danielito told the independent outlet Cubanet on Monday. “But the main thing was that they wanted me to tell my father to leave the country, and I told them no, that I would never tell him that and that he would also never accept leaving because he is willing to die if it is necessary for freedom for Cuba.”

Nelva Ortega was missing until about 11 p.m. UNPACU members later confirmed on Monday that police had freed her late at night and she spent the night with the baby’s grandmother.

Ana Belkis Ferrer later wrote on Twitter that she managed to communicate with her sister-in-law and that she said police had “interrogated her and threatened to take her baby.” Police also allegedly banned her from Sunday Mass, a common punishment for Cuban pro-democracy dissidents as a large number of them tend to be practicing Catholics. Ferrer disappeared shortly after organizing a pro-democracy march in honor of the patron saint of Cuba, Our Lady of Charity. The peaceful march ended in over 100 arrests.

(@anabelkisfg) February 10, 2020

If Ferrer chooses not to leave the country, he faces up to nine years in prison on false charges of assault and kidnapping, for which the Communist Party has offered no evidence.

The Castro regime has increasingly used forced exile, a universally recognized human rights crime, to silence dissidents, as it tends to attract less attention from human rights activists than killing, imprisoning, or torturing them. In May 2019, police forced Cuban dissident Daniel Llorente – who spent over a year in a “mental health facility” enduring torture after waving an American flag at the annual May Day communist parade – on a plane to Guyana, which he said he had no choice but to take or face prison and death.

A month after that incident, Cuban Prisoners Defenders published an extensive report showing that hundreds of dissidents had faced similar pressure.

“We can, without fear of error, [say] that these cases occur at the scale of hundreds annually, and that these have affected thousands of human rights activists, independent journalists, dissident artists, religious leaders, and other organized pacific groups,” the group revealed. “The number of those not belonging to any group, and those who no one has heard news of, could [increase] the cases to many times the number deduced by this study.”

José Daniel Ferrer is believed to be enduring inhumane prison conditions that could severely damage his health. In a report in November, Nelva Ortega said that, upon visiting her partner, she found him extremely thin, with a pre-existing ulcer exacerbated by being forced to drink rancid water and eat fecal matter as a form of torture.

299,Report: Brazil Sees Macron’s France as Biggest Military Threat,['Ben Kew'],"Brazilian military leaders consider France to be their country’s biggest threat over the next 20 years as a result of disputes surrounding the Amazon rainforest, according to a leaked document published by Brazilian media this weekend.

The document, published by left-wing newspaper Folha de São Paulo, allegedly detailed the view of many of Brazil’s senior military officials that France could demand a United Nations intervention within the next two decades to gain control of indigenous lands within the Amazon rainforest.

France borders Brazil through its possession of French Guiana.

Entitled “Defence scenarios 2040,” the 45-page-long document is allegedly based on interviews with 500 highly-ranking army officers, who gave their perspectives on the challenges facing Brazil’s national security. The interviews were allegedly taken as research to write Brazil’s upcoming National Security Strategy, to be published in the summer.

The French embassy in Brasilia jokingly praised the “limitless imagination of its authors.”

“We learned from the press that France appears in a report by the Brazilian Ministry of Defense as a future threat to Brazil,” the Embassy said in a statement. “Armed forces in all countries often carry out this type of scenario analysis exercise. However, we welcome the limitless imagination of the authors of this report.”

“The fact is that Brazil is our main strategic partner in Latin America and France has maintained daily, close and friendly cooperative relations with the Brazilian Armed Forces for decades,” it continued.

Folha claimed that the document included other “somewhat delirious hypotheses,” including the prospect of a coronavirus attack against the 2039 Rock in Rio music festival by “Southeast Asian ultranationalists.”

Tensions between Brazil and France broke out last year after French President Emmanuel Macron attacked his Brazilian counterpart Jair Bolsonaro over his supposed lack of response to images of wildfires across the Amazon, while also insisting that the international community should be allowed to intervene in an attempt to reduce their impact.

Macron proposed a $20 million donation from G7 states, an offer firmly rejected by Bolsonaro. Chief of Staff Onyx Lorenzon accused the French leader of having a “colonialist” mindset and failing to address problems in his own country. There are various French military operations taking place around the world, principally across the Middle East and Africa, where it is supporting U.S.-led efforts against the Islamic State and its various terror proxies including Boko Haram and Al-Shabaab.

The document lists four separate strategic scenarios where countries could present a military threat to Brazil, all of which are based on the closeness of the country’s relationship with the United States. Among the identified scenarios include a military conflict with the Maduro dictatorship in Venezuela, a military intervention of Bolivia’s Santa Cruz de la Sierra aimed at protecting Brazilian farmers, and a potential conflict with China over Beijing’s increased interference in Latin American affairs.

300,El Salvador: President Bukele Orders Military to Storm Congress,['Ben Kew'],"The President of El Salvador Nayib Bukele ordered the military into the nation’s parliament on Sunday to demand that lawmakers pass legislation to secure a loan aimed at reducing the country’s shocking levels of gang violence.

Dozens of armed troops entered the building to demand that lawmakers vote to approve a $109 million loan intended to better equip police and other security forces in their fight against out-of-control gang violence. Some of the new equipment would include new police vehicles, uniforms, surveillance equipment, and a helicopter.

El Salvador has one of the highest murder rates in the world, leading Bukele to launch an initiative known as the Territorial Control Plan. According to data from El Salvador’s National Civil Police, the average daily murder rate fell from 9.2 in May 2019, the month before Bukele assumed office, to 3.8 by last month. #ElSalvador Elementos de la Fuerza Armada ingresan al Salón Azul de la Asamblea Legislativa.

Bukele has attributed this drop to the implementation of his Territorial Control Plan, which largely involves upgrading the equipment. The majority of lawmakers failed to attend a debate over the weekend to discuss legislation that will allow Bukele to implement its third phase.

Lawmakers from both the opposition right-wing National Republican Alliance (ARENA) and the leftist Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) have expressed concern about the size of the loan and Bukele’s justification for many of the expenses included within it.

After the number of attendees failed to reach quorum, Bukele called on his supporters to take to the streets in protest. Around 50,000 consequently attended a pro-Bukele demonstration on Sunday. Addressing his supporters outside parliament, Bukele gave his opponents a week’s deadline to pass the legislation before stepping up his efforts by expelling them from parliament. “If we wanted to press the button, we would press the button,” he said, in reference to removing the lawmakers. “But I asked God and God told me: patience, patience, patience. On February 28 [2021] all these scoundrels are heading out the door. If they do not approve [the loan for] the Territorial Control Plan, we will summon them here on Sunday.” Bukele’s methods have drawn international condemnation, with critics comparing it to the behavior of an authoritarian dictator. The Washington-based human rights group Human Rights Watch denounced the move as an “exhibition of brute force” and called for a meeting of members of the Organization of American States (OAS). United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet called for “dialogue and full respect for democratic institutions to guarantee the rule of law, including the independence of the branches of public power.” Yet in a message to the international community on Monday, Bukele insisted he had the backing of Salvadorans. “El Salvador is dominated by the sides of the civil war, these two sides continue with corruption and negotiate with criminal groups. There are videos of them negotiating lives in exchange for votes. The people have already tired of this and their president feels the same.” A la Comunidad Internacional: El Salvador está dominado por los bandos de la guerra civil, esos dos bandos continúan con la corrupción y negocian con grupos crimínales. Hay videos de ellos negociando vidas a cambio de votos. El pueblo ya se cansó y el Presidente está con ellos. — Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) February 9, 2020 Bukele, who was expelled from the leftist FMLN, was elected on a populist platform that sought to blend elements of both the left and right. He has turned himself into one of Latin America’s most unconventional leaders. Shortly after taking office, he went on a firing spree via Twitter of many senior government officials. He has also sent mixed messages on the question of policy, describing the U.S. as his country’s “most important ally” while readily accepting numerous “donations” from the Chinese government.",https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/02/10/el-salvador-president-bukele-orders-military-storm-congress-help-pass-security-bill/
301,Venezuelan Socialists Promise Pregnant Women ‘Childbirth Without Pain’,['Frances Martel'],"5VTV, Venezuela’s socialist state propaganda outlet, promoted a social program on Thursday called the “Humanized Childbirth” initiative, which dictator Nicolás Maduro claimed would grant mothers “childbirth without pain.”

VTV specifically celebrated the fact that women now have access to the program through the Carnet de la Patria (“Fatherland Card”), a social credit system developed by China’s ZTE telecommunications firm, according to a Reuters report. Maduro forces Venezuelans to use the “Fatherland Land” for purchases of basic goods, gasoline, medical care, and other necessary activity in life, which allows Caracas to individually track the behavior of every citizen. Those without the “Fatherland Card” cannot access the little food and government services Maduro provides.

“In Venezuela, the Fatherland Card protects 818,000 women,” VTV claimed. “349,000 in Material Lactation and 469,000 through the Humanized Childbirth [program].”

Maduro announced these numbers at an event celebrating three years of the imposition of the “Fatherland Card” surveillance system on the Venezuelan people, VTV noted.

“Humanized Childbirth,” it went on to explain, was a program to “empower and protect women.” The report did not specify what exactly the program did to help pregnant women, but quoted Maduro’s remarks from when the program was first announced years ago.

“I will launch the National Plan for Humanized Childbirth, for childbirth without pain, to support and help them [new mothers],” Maduro said at the time. “So that they have a happy childbirth, a healthy, happy, human gestation. That is why we have to constitutionalize all these missions so that nobody can ever privatize the rights of Venezuelans.”

Maduro put the “Humanized Childbirth” plan into action in July 2017, at the time regarded as a program for “communitarian accompaniment” for women having babies. The plan resulted in a constitutional amendment reading, “the State must guarantee protection and assistance for maternity from [the moment of] conception, during the pregnancy, and at childbirth.”

The only concrete plan apparently resulting from this amendment was a national propaganda campaign to raise awareness for its existence – the government hired 10,000 “promoters,” all women, to visit communities and tell women that the government had passed a law to benefit them during maternity. The promoters would then register the women for the Fatherland Card, a surveillance tool. In theory, registering as pregnant through the Fatherland Card would yield more food and money than non-pregnant women would receive.

The Fatherland Card is not a new program. The program debuted in 2014 as a ration card to keep Venezuelans from buying what they needed for their families at supermarkets. At the time, inflation in Venezuela was at 60 percent and rapidly rising, alarming Maduro’s regime. Currently, the inflation rate is estimated to be around 10 million percent.

At the time of the first ration cards, stocks of basic food goods such as vegetable oil, wheat flour, milk, coffee, sugar, canned sardines, pork, and butter began to become difficult to find in supermarkets. As a backup to the new ration card system, Maduro ordered all supermarket owners to install fingerprint scanners to ensure Venezuelans did not purchase more than their allotted limits of food for any given day.

By 2017, a significant percentage of Venezuelans were eating from trash heaps in Caracas, unable to find food at supermarkets, as a result of Maduro’s socialist economic policy. That year, Reuters reported, Maduro spent $70 million to upgrading internet surveillance and the use of the Fatherland Card for surveillance, turning it into a rudimentary version of China’s “social credit system,” which allots point scores to every citizen based on loyalty to the Communist Party. The card, in addition to serving as a ration card, then began documenting “birthdays, family information, employment and income, property owned, medical history, state benefits received, presence on social media, membership of a political party and whether a person voted.”

The collapse of Venezuela’s economy brought with it a collapse in the healthcare system, which late dictator Hugo Chávez had nationalized. Currently, Venezuela lacks supplies of nearly every single drug the World Health Organization (WHO) lists as necessary for a functional healthcare system, from common painkillers like acetaminophen to birth control bills to expensive cancer and HIV drugs. Venezuela’s maternity wards, like every other part of the nation’s hospitals, lack both cleaning and medical supplies and basic items to clean the hospitals, like cleaning liquids and even water. The result is routine infections that kill infants. Among the most notorious was the socialist healthcare system’s mass killing of 17 newborns at a maternity ward in Anzoátegui state, where an opossum infestation had left the nursery full of dangerous animal waste. Doctors lamented that they had no way of disinfecting the ward or cleaning up the opossum waste, much less actually ending the pest infestation.

More recently, Univisión published shocking images from a nursery in the city of Maracay that had run out of bassinets and was storing newborns in cardboard boxes.

Maternity wards are largely overpopulated partially because of the lack of birth control. By 2016, reports began surfacing of a teen pregnancy crisis. As schools have also largely shut down – with no food, electricity, or basic school necessities available – the rate of teen pregnancy has skyrocketed.

Experts also believe that maternal mortality rates have risen. Between 2015 and 2016, the maternal mortality rate nationwide increased by 66 percent. Maduro then ordered health officials to stop publishing that statistic, leaving the world in the dark on how many women are dying in childbirth in Venezuela.

302,Judge in Brazil Drops Cybercrime Charges Against Glenn Greenwald,['Frances Martel'],"Brazilian Judge Ricardo Leite dismissed charges against journalist Glenn Greenwald on Thursday citing a Supreme Court injunction against prosecuting Greenwald for engaging in journalism. Prosecutors charged Greenwald with cybercrimes over allegedly advising hackers to destroy incriminating evidence.

Greenwald has denied that he engaged in the alleged criminal activity, which prosecutors claim occurred during the process of Greenwald procuring private conversations among high-ranking Brazilian officials. Greenwald published conversations at The Intercept featuring remarks from current Minister of Justice Sergio Moro from when he was the judge responsible for the “Operation Car Wash” corruption investigation. The excerpts showed Moro’s growing distaste for former socialist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva as the probe went on. Moro’s investigation ultimately led to Lula being sentenced to over a decade in prison for using illegally procured kickback funding to buy a luxury beachfront property.

Prosecutors claimed that Greenwald, who claims that the Telegram messages he published were leaked to him and The Intercept, was aware that hackers had broken into Moro’s communications and advised them to destroy messages that would reveal their crimes. Charges against Greenwald were imposed alongside greater criminal charges for the individuals who committed the hacking, some of whom allegedly confessed to having done so.

Brazil’s Federal Supreme Court issued an injunction in response to the incident that banned prosecutors from charging Greenwald specifically for any activity involved in receiving, obtaining or transmitting information published in media outlets,” Brazil’s O Globo noted.

Judge Leite said in his decision that the injunction clearly barred prosecution against Greenwald in the hacking incident, but said that the evidence indicates that Greenwald indeed committed a crime.

“The journalist cannot suggest what the person committing illicit acts should do to escape the prosecution work of the State,” the judge wrote. “They can keep a secret and not reveal to public authorities the identity of their source, but without any instigating or reinforcement of an already existing idea on the part of the agent that makes investigative work difficult.”

Leite wrote that the evidence suggested that one of the hackers had doubts about deleting incriminating messages and Greenwald “expressed a favorable opinion” on the matter, urging him to destroy evidence. The judge called Greenwald’s conduct “moral participation” in crime and described it as a “clear attempt to obstruct the work of investigating illicit [activity] and it is not possible to use source secrecy protection to create an exception” to being prosecuted.

Leite concluded that Greenwald would not face charges “for now.”

In a statement relayed by The Intercept, Greenwald expressed mild relief while arguing that the judge did not go far enough, as any journalist without a personal supreme court injunction to his or her name would have faced charges.

“While I welcome the fact that this investigation will not move forward, this decision is insufficient to guarantee the rights of a free press,” Greenwald said. “The rejection is based on the fact that the Supreme Court already issued an injunction against attempts of official persecution against me. This is not enough. We seek a decisive rejection from the Supreme Court of this abusive prosecution on the grounds that it is a clear and grave assault on core press freedoms. Anything less would leave open the possibility of further erosion of the fundamental freedom of the press against other journalists.”

In remarks to Brazilian media, Greenwald similarly declared, “we are not satisfied.”

“The decision protects me individually, but it is a grave violation of the freedom of the press and can create a precedent for other journalists being criminalized in the future,” Greenwald told Brazilian journalist Leonardo Sakamoto. “We want a victory not only to protect me, but to protect the constitutional rights and liberties of the press. Because of that, we are going to the STF [Supreme Court].”

Greenwald also noted that the decision “more or less frees me from the danger of being criminally processed but, at the same time, puts at risk all the other journalists and freedom of the press.”

The editor-in-chief of The Intercept, Betsy Reed, offered supportive words for Greenwald but similarly warned that anyone also accused of helping criminals destroy evidence could face prosecution.

“Today’s ruling rightly rejects the charges against Glenn Greenwald. As federal police investigators affirmed last year, he did nothing wrong,” Reed said in a statement. “However, the ruling is narrow and procedural, based on the injunction issued by a Supreme Court minister last year.”

The original case against Greenwald, filed last month, claimed the journalist had “received material of illicit origin while the criminal organization [the hacker ring allegedly responsible] was still practicing such conduct, seeking new targets.” Prosecutors claimed that Greenwald “oriented the [hacker] group by telling them to dispose of messages archived to avoid linking the suspects to the ‘hacked’ content, demonstrating direct participation in criminal conduct.”

303,Maduro: Trump Won't Stop 'Humanist Christian Socialism' in Venezuela,['Frances Martel'],"Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro discussed on Wednesday the warm reception the actual president of his country, Juan Guaidó, received at President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address Tuesday, decrying Trump as “interventionist” and “immoral.”

Maduro, who maintains control of the country through the military but has not legally been president since January 2018, denounced Trump’s move to invite the president to his address as “illegal,” following up on a statement from his foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza, that described the address as a “circus spectacle.”

Speaking on Wednesday evening, Maduro also claimed that he had tried to “extend his hand” to Trump at the beginning of the latter’s presidency, but that he had allowed those around him aware of the destitution that Maduro’s Bolivarian socialist had caused in what was once the wealthiest nation in the region to “take [him] to failure.”

“Donald Trump, you will not be able to handle Venezuela,” Maduro declared. “No one can crush or break Venezuela. Venezuela has a right to peace, to development towards the future, to its work, to its recovery.”

Maduro then reiterated the false claim that Guaidó had somehow been installed in the presidency by the United States. In reality, the Venezuelan constitution grants the National Assembly, the federal legislature, the right to appoint an interim president in the event of a “rupture in the democratic order,” commonly defined as a situation where an incumbent president refuses to leave power after his or her term ends. Maduro refused to leave in January 2019 after his term ended, so the Assembly appointed Guaidó, then the Assembly president, the president of the country.

Maduro claims legitimacy based on an election in May 2018 in which he banned all non-Marxist candidates from running and intimidated voters into choosing between voting for someone else and, often, their food or livelihoods.

“In Venezuela, the president of the republic isn’t chosen by the president of the United States,” Maduro declared on Wednesday. “The people of Venezuela choose him through popular vote. It has always been like this and it will always be like this. And I am the president legitimately elected according to the constitution.”

“Enough with your sick obsession, Trump, with Venezuela!” Maduro boomed. “I extended my hand to Trump many times and he thinks that, if one wants dialogue, that is a sign of weakness, no? I tell the people of the United States, Donald Trump is marching the United States towards a high-level conflict against Venezuela.”

“I call on the honest sectors of the United States to confront this interventionist, illegal, immoral policy of Donald Trump against the noble and pacific people of Venezuela. We will continue our path, we will continue it,” Maduro affirmed. “We will continue transiting through the socialist revolution’s path. We have the right to build socialism and we will build it – a new, democratic, humanist, Christian socialism of the 21st century, our socialism.”

Maduro concluded by announcing that Guaidó would “end up without a job” by the end of the year because Maduro is calling for socialist-led National Assembly elections and that, when he does, “it will be [Trump’s] failure.”

“Donald, Mister Donald Trump, they have taken you to failure and the same advisors you have are taking you to failure by putting the dummy, the puppet by your side,” Maduro said of Guaidó. “They filled you with defeat, with failure, with lies, with manipulation. Meanwhile, us in Venezuela, time to get to work.”

Unlike his foreign minister Arreaza – late dictator Hugo Chávez’s son-in-law – Maduro did not insult the State of the Union address itself, instead insulting Trump personally. Earlier on Wednesday, Arreaza issued an official statement disparaging the entire address as “delirious and arrogant” and warning that America was attempting to “plague our America with misery,” referring to Latin America.

“In an agonizing effort to revive the already failed strategy of changing the government by force in the middle of a circus spectacle, Trump offended and disrespected the Venezuelan people by offering violent threats against their integrity and the legitimate, constitutional, and democratic government of President Nicolás Maduro Moros,” Arreaza wrote. “Venezuela is and will be irrevocably free and independent, only the people of Venezuela will determine its victorious, sovereign, and socialist present and future.”

Trump addressed the dire humanitarian situation in Venezuela during his State of the Union speech Tuesday before acknowledging and applauding Guaidó, a surprise guest at the event.

White House

“Here this evening is a man who carries with him the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of all Venezuelans. Joining us in the gallery is the true and legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaidó,” Trump said. “Mr. President, please take this message back to your homeland: All Americans are united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom! Socialism destroys nations. But always remember, freedom unifies the soul.”

Trump met with Guaidó in the White House on Wednesday.

304,Brazil: Bolsonaro Launches Anti-Sex Campaign,['Ben Kew'],"The government of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro launched a campaign this week aimed at encouraging young people to refrain from sex as part of an effort to bring down the rate of teenage pregnancies.

The campaign, jointly run by the Ministry for Health and the Ministry for Women, Family and Human Rights, is using the slogan “Adolescence first, pregnancy after” to discourage young women from falling pregnant at a young age and prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STD).

One of the main methods of spreading their message is through social media, where young women’s accounts are targeted with the hashtag #tudonoseutempo (“all in good time”).

Pais e responsáveis, vamos conversar com nossos adolescentes. O diálogo é fundamental. #tudotemseutempo pic.twitter.com/mel0TitaKQ — Damares Alves (@DamaresAlves) February 5, 2020

With a population of 209 million people, Brazil has the highest rate of teen pregnancy in all of Latin America, a trend that Bolsonaro’s pro-family and pro-Christian administration is seeking to reverse. Abortion remains illegal except in the cases of rape or when the woman’s life is at risk, with women found guilty of seeking the procedure liable to up to three years in prison.

The pregnancy rate has fallen in recent years, although it still remains well above the rest of the world with around 62 pregnancies per 1,000 teenagers aged 15-19, compared with a global average of 44 per 1,000.

The campaign is led by Minister for Women, Family and Human Rights Damares Alves, a former attorney and evangelical pastor. She maintains that the campaign is more about reducing teenage pregnancy than promoting religious values.

“It didn’t come from an insight, from a moment of madness from a fundamentalist minister,” she explained. “It’s been a year of talking because we need to bring the numbers down. We had the courage to say we are going to talk about delaying the start of sexual relations.”

E nossa campanha que começa hoje já está chegando em todos os lugares. Painel na Câmara dos Deputados! pic.twitter.com/Qlm2G4cHwN — Damares Alves (@DamaresAlves) February 3, 2020

Brazil’s secretary for the Rights of Children and Adolescents, Maurício José Silva Cunha, told O Globo that the main aim is to “preserve the human rights of children and adolescents” through the promotion of nuclear families.

Although the term “abstinence” is not specifically referred to in the campaign, one of the organizations involved in the campaign is Eu Escolhi Esperar (“I decided to wait”), an Evangelical group founded by pastor Nelson Junior that encourages abstinence.

“Why not tell people to wait?” Junior told the BBC. “It’s logical, not ideological or religious. One thing we need to overcome here in Brazil is this new debate that everything that comes from religion is bad.”

Alves confirmed that the government will continue to provide information on methods of birth control and encourage young people to talk to doctors about their sexual health. However, the government still plans to phase out traditional sexual education in schools and replace it with an abstinence-based sex education policy.

The policies are part of President Jair Bolsonaro’s years-long crusade against sex education. In 2018, he argued that teachers must be “prohibited from speaking about abortion, adolescent pregnancy, AIDS and other sexual matters,” even threatening to place cameras in the classrooms so that parents and government officials can keep an eye on the kind of information they are conveying.

Critics might argue that reducing rates teenage pregnancy should be lower on Bolsonaro’s priority list given the other problems Brazil is facing. Elected in 2018 on a platform promising the restoration of law and order, Bolsonaro’s main priorities for include reducing the country’s shocking levels of violence (typically a result of rival gangs and prison riots), cracking down on rampant corruption, maintaining community cohesion amid simmering tensions towards the wave of Venezuelans migrants fleeing the humanitarian crisis in their homeland, and wiping out terrorist and drug trafficking activity from Islamist terror organizations such as Hezbollah.

His administration has had some success in reducing crime, with the Ministry of Justice documenting a 20-percent drop in homicides. However, his stance on corruption has been somewhat undermined by the release of former socialist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who was freed last year following a court ruling having served just over a year of his 12-year sentence for money laundering.

305,Maduro Regime Calls Trump SOTU a 'Circus Spectacle',['Frances Martel'],"The socialist regime of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro dismissed on Wednesday President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address as a “circus spectacle” that the Venezuelan people found “offensive and disrespectful.”

Among Trump’s guests on Tuesday night was the legitimate President of Venezuela Juan Guaidó, who Maduro has refused to allow to use his powers by maintaining a stranglehold on the Venezuelan military and keeping control of the presidential palace. Trump acknowledged Guaidó and promised him the full backing of the American people as Guaidó received a standing ovation. Trump met with Guaidó at the White House on Wednesday.

“In an agonizing effort to revive the already failed strategy of changing the government by force in the middle of a circus spectacle, Trump offended and disrespected the Venezuelan people by offering violent threats against their integrity and the legitimate, constitutional, and democratic government of President Nicolás Maduro Moros,” Maduro’s “foreign minister,” Jorge Arreaza, said in a written statement. “Venezuela is and will be irrevocably free and independent, only the people of Venezuela will determine its victorious, sovereign, and socialist present and future.”

Arreaza’s statement went on to accuse Trump of delivering a “delirious and arrogant” national address with “disdain for peace, for international law, and in particular for the sovereignty of Venezuela” and promised Maduro’s regime would never allow America to “plague our America with misery in the name of false freedom.”

Arreaza’s statement falsely refers to Maduro as the president of the country. Maduro makes this claim based on a presidential election he held in May 2018 that most of the free world considers illegitimate. Maduro banned non-Marxist candidates from running in that election and intimidated government workers and those dependent on socialists for access to basic goods and food – which is a large percentage of the country after two decades of socialist decline – into voting for his United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV). Despite the intimidation, the election marked the lowest turnout in the history of the country.

Given that the election was fraudulent, Maduro’s presidential term ended in January 2019. The National Assembly, assuming its constitutional role in the event of what the Venezuelan constitution calls a “rupture in the democratic order,” appointed Guaidó as interim president to fill the void left by Maduro’s illegitimacy. Guaidó has completely failed to exercise any of his presidential powers, however, as Maduro maintains control of the Venezuelan military and the presidential palace. Through the military, Maduro has maintained a campaign of state force to kill, injure, imprison, and torture political dissidents since he took power in 2013.

The PSUV, rather than offering a comment, reposted on Twitter a video that appeared to refer to Guaidó’s presence in Washington: remarks by late socialist dictator Hugo Chávez accusing the United States of “daily campaigns” of “confusion” that target the nation’s middle class and entice them to support capitalism.

“American imperialism … is or it has achieved it in those daily campaigns, and all-hour campaigns through TV, through radio, through written press, to confuse millions of our compatriots,” Chávez said in the video. “Many of them living in poverty, even, or many of them having studied and living in the middle class, they do a lot of harm there … take out of the state of confusion a lot of compatriots.”

Maduro’s state propaganda network also posted a listicle of “the eight most shameful moments” from the State of the Union address, which listed Guaidó’s appearance as an embarrassment. In reality, Guaidó received a standing ovation, as did President Trump for his remarks on the situation in Venezuela.

White House

“The United States is leading a 59-nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro,” Trump said in his speech. “Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, a tyrant who brutalizes his people. But Maduro’s grip of tyranny will be smashed and broken.”

He then introduced the president of Venezuela.

“Here this evening is a man who carries with him the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of all Venezuelans. Joining us in the gallery is the true and legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaidó,” Trump continued. “Mr. President, please take this message back to your homeland: All Americans are united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom!

306,Venezuela Tries to Prepare for Coronavirus Without a Healthcare System,['Frances Martel'],"The National Assembly of Venezuela – the last remaining democratically elected branch of government – approved a plan on Tuesday to help with coronavirus awareness and distribute a manual on how to contain the outbreak if it reaches the Latin American country.

Thanks to the socialist regime of dictator Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela has deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party, which has invested millions in keeping him in power. China is responsible for building a social surveillance system known as the “Fatherland card” for Maduro to help track dissidents and deny them food and basic goods. China has also attempted to get Venezuela to sign onto its “Belt and Road Initiative,” a sprawling international bid for Beijing to build and control most of the world’s transportation infrastructure, but Caracas’ ongoing economic crisis has made it impossible for Maduro to sign onto any major project.

The ties between the Chinese Communist Party and Maduro mean that travel between the two countries occurs regularly, potentially exposing Venezuela to the ongoing outbreak of a newly documented coronavirus in China. The virus, originating in the central city of Wuhan, has infected over 20,000 people and killed nearly 500 since the Communist Party announced the discovery of the virus on January 20.

Given the potential of a traveler from China bringing the virus into Venezuela – and the state of abandon and collapse that the Venezuelan healthcare system currently finds itself in – the National Assembly approved a measure that would create a protocol for how to handle a potential coronavirus case independent of the Maduro regime.

“This manual will be distributed in health centers, customs checkpoints, the Maiquetía International Airport, so that public officials will know what they are facing and what protection they should use,” José Manuel Olivares, a National Assembly member in exile who spearheaded the effort, said after it passed.

“70 percent of hospitals in the country don’t have water and the primary coronavirus prevention measure is washing one’s hands,” the lawmaker added. “89 percent of hospitals report electricity interruptions and only 49 percent of these institutions have emergency rooms open. 2,602 Venezuelans died in the country because there were no medical supplies to tend to trauma.”

“The precarious health situation in the country make us require these alerts because there is the possibility of coronavirus reaching Venezuela,” he concluded.

The novel coronavirus is highly contagious through moisture particles ejected while coughing, breathing, or sneezing. Experts believe that it may be contagious even before a carrier has visible symptoms, which tend to include fever, coughing, and body aches. Washing hands, wearing face masks, and staying away from crowded areas are pivotal measures to control the outbreak.

Another lawmaker, José Trujillo, noted on Tuesday that, even if the coronavirus outbreak had reached the country, it would be impossible for Venezuela to know because hospitals do not have testing kits. The World Health Organization (WHO) is organizing the global response; as a United Nations body, it incorrectly identified Nicolás Maduro as the nation’s head of state, excluding legitimate President Juan Guaidó. It remains unclear how the WHO would be able to distribute humanitarian aid or testing supplies in Venezuela given that it does not recognize Guaidó and Maduro’s regime refuses to acknowledge that the country has needed humanitarian aid for years.

“In Venezuela, we don’t even have a way to test [someone] to detect coronavirus,” Trujillo noted. “Prevention is key and in this country it is almost impossible to do it. International organizations should send aid to deal with this virus and avoid a tragedy.”

He added, “Venezuela will not escape the threat because we have alliances with Asian nations and the virus lives for 14 days before being detected [in someone’s body], so it can reach the country. The virus is a genetic alteration, but the truth isn’t being told to the world.”

Maduro’s regime has downplayed that threat, claiming that it has implemented the necessary safeguards to prevent the virus from ravaging the country. Maduro’s “health minister” Carlos Alvarado said on Monday that the WHO’s subgroup in the region, the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), would be sending testing kits to Venezuela this week. He added that Venezuela has requested that other countries identify coronavirus patients before they board planes to the country. He insisted the regime had yet to identify a coronavirus case in Venezuela.

China’s state-run news service Xinhua highlighted Maduro expressing solidarity with the Communist Party on the outbreak.

“The entire world looks on in awe at the energetic determination with which the Chinese government has met the sanitary protocols recommended by international organizations specialized in health to control the propagation of the virus,” a statement from Maduro this week read.

The Venezuelan Red Cross has expressed panic at Maduro’s coronavirus preparedness. Last week, the president of the organization, Mario Villarroel, warned that “we are not ready to fully combat this disease,” noting the dire state of Venezuela’s socialist healthcare system.

“We are calling for the prevention of the coronavirus. We are not ready to fully combat this disease. This is something that the Health Ministry has to prepare. Neither the medicines nor the treatment necessary are here,” Villarroel said.

Venezuela’s healthcare system, which Maduro boasts is a prime example of government-run health care and Venezuela’s government is constitutionally mandated to run, deals regularly with chronic shortages of medicine, electricity, and water. Amputations became increasingly common as the economy began to rot under Maduro in 2014, as antibiotics ran short, and nearly every medicine on the WHO’s list of necessary, basic medicines is no longer available. Vaccines are also in short supply, resulting in outbreaks of diseases Venezuela had eradicated before socialism, like malaria, measles, and diptheria. Patients living with chronic diseases like diabetes or HIV have little to no access to necessary treatment.",https://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/02/05/venezuela-tries-prepare-coronavirus-without-healthcare-system/
307,Trump to Guaidó: Socialist Tyranny 'Will Be Smashed and Broken',['Frances Martel'],"President Donald Trump welcomed Venezuelan President Juan Guaidó to Congress as a distinguished guest of his State of the Union address on Tuesday, vowing that America would stand behind his legitimate claim to power against dictator Nicolás Maduro.

Guaidó became president in January 2019 after Maduro’s last presidential term ended. Maduro refused to step down, claiming the presidency based on a largely fraudulent 2018 election in which he allowed only Marxist candidates to participate. The National Assembly, the Venezuelan legislature, used its constitutional power to replace Maduro with the leader of their branch of government, Guaidó, but Maduro retains control of the armed forces and the presidential palace illegally.

Guaidó is currently on a world tour to galvanize support for his interim presidency and allies in helping oust Maduro from power. Guaidó was a member of the socialist Popular Will party when he became president but left the party this month to dedicate himself completely to the campaign to restore democracy in his country.

“The United States is leading a 59-nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro,” Trump noted in his remarks. “Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, a tyrant who brutalizes his people. But Maduro’s grip of tyranny will be smashed and broken.”

“Here this evening is a man who carries with him the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of all Venezuelans. Joining us in the gallery is the true and legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaidó,” Trump continued, allowing for a pause for the chamber to applaud Guaidó and offer him a standing ovation. “Mr. President, please take this message back to your homeland: All Americans are united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom! Socialism destroys nations. But always remember, freedom unifies the soul.”

The moment comes after months of growing restlessness and doubt surrounding Guaidó, who declared in April last year that the Venezuelan military had agreed to obey him, only to have Maduro and his defense minister, Vladimir Padrino López, mock him on state television and leave him once again powerless. Guaidó later agreed to “talks” with the Maduro regime brokered by Norway, a nation that does not recognize Guaidó’s legitimacy and a political move widely panned by the Venezuelan people.

Guaidó remains, nonetheless, the legitimate president of Venezuela. Venezuela’s constitution states that, in the event of a “rupture of the democratic order,” such as a president refusing to step down after his term ends, the National Assembly can appoint an interim president tasked with organizing elections.

Venezuela is currently suffering through the worst humanitarian crisis in its history. After 20 years of socialist rule, the nation’s economy has collapsed, leaving a broken electric grid, hospitals with a near-complete shortage of every basic medicine on the World Health Organization’s list of necessary medications, empty markets, and streets laden with garbage, where many Venezuelans scavenge to eat. Maduro has blamed President Donald Trump, and Barack Obama before him, for the crisis.

308,Venezuela President Juan Guaido Attends Trump's State of the Union,['Charlie Spiering'],"President Donald Trump welcomed Venezuelan President Juan Guaido to Tuesday night’s State of the Union address.

Guaido’s attendance at the speech was not included on the president’s guest list but was likely expected to be a surprise. The news was first reported by Bloomberg News.

The president’s invitation demonstrates that his administration still backs Guaido, despite Venezuela dictator Nicolas Maduro clinging to power in the country.

President Trump may use Guaido’s appearance as a guest of the speech to highlight the false promises of socialism, citing the collapse of Venezuela as an example. Last week, Guaido met with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Guaido is attempting to boost his claim to power as about 50 countries have recognized him as the rightful political leader of Venezuela.

In January 2018, the Venezuelan National Assembly appointed Guaido as the president when Maduro refused to leave power after the fraudulent 2017 election in Venezuela. Maduro also still controls the Venezuala military.

Although the president has reportedly expressed doubts about Guaido’s ability to oust Maduro, his recent State of the Union gesture sends a message to Venezuela that the opposition leader still has his support.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/04/venezuela-president-juan-guaido-attends-trumps-state-of-the-union-speech/
309,NYT: Failed State Venezuela Experiencing ‘Economic Boom’ in Caracas,"['Ben Kew', 'Isayen Herrera', 'Explains That Venezuela S Socialist Elites', 'Many Of Whom Have Close Ties To Nicolás Maduro S Socialist Dictatorship', 'Are Suddenly Benefiting A', 'Striking Economic Boom.', 'According To The']","The New York Times published a report on Sunday declaring that Caracas, Venezuela, is experiencing an “economic boom,” despite the fact that the country is still in the midst of a humanitarian emergency that has led to one of the world’s most pressing migratory crises.

The report, written by Anatoly Kurmanaev and

“Shopping malls that were deserted six months ago are bustling, and imported SUVs course through the streets,” the report notes. “New restaurants and bars are popping up weekly in the wealthier parts of town, their tables packed with foreign businessmen, fashionable locals and government insiders.”

The changes have transformed Venezuela in ways few in Washington or Caracas had envisioned. They are reminiscent of how allies Cuba & Nicaragua ditched Communist policies for private investment when faced with US economic pressure in previous decades https://t.co/sG6sr6B1NI — Anatoly Kurmanaev (@AKurmanaev) February 1, 2020

The report goes on to admit that the benefits of such investment are largely confined to Maduro’s supporters who are “living handsomely on business deals and stashes of hard currency.” One example of such beneficiaries are customers of the 1956 Lounge, where “teenagers and their parents sipped champagne and discussed coming yacht trips.”

It then describes the “starkly unequal impact” of Maduro’s reforms, which include reducing red tape and barely enforcing taxation, fueling a boom in private exports and investment. It turns out to only be “well-connected officials and military officers [who] have benefited from a plethora of new business opportunities and government concessions in everything from gold mining to beach hotels.”

Another factor behind this boom could also be that many wealthy Venezuelans living in Miami with links to the Maduro regime have returned home, consequently bringing their money back into the country. This is likely a bid to avoid economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. on those with official ties to the regime that froze their U.S.-based assets. Allies of Maduro have also faced growing hostility from anti-socialist compatriots seeking refuge in Florida.

Despite this supposedly “booming” economy, it is noted that Venezuela’s GDP is predicted to fall by a further ten percent this year, having already shrunk by a staggering two thirds since Maduro seized power following the death of late socialist revolutionary Hugo Chávez in 2013. The collapse has led to an economic and humanitarian crisis so severe that millions of Venezuelans have fled the country since 2015, with the Organization of American States predicting that number could reach as high as 10 million by the end of 2022.

The report ends up concluding that for the vast majority of Venezuelans, Maduro’s reforms have only delivered “marginal relief from the economic devastation of recent years,” despite the fact around 80 percent of Venezuelans also feel they are worse off than they were a year ago.

The New York Times has a dubious history regarding its approach to Venezuela. In 2017, the paper ran a $200,000 advertisement from the Maduro regime accusing President Donald Trump of seeking to “manufacture a political crisis” in the country after he imposed multiple economic sanctions against its economy over egregious human rights violations.

That same year, the Times also published a full-page open letter by Venezuela’s former Vice President Tareck El Aissami, known for his allegedly close ties to Iranian terror proxy Hezbollah, condemning the U.S. Treasury Department for sanctioning him as an official “Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker” for his involvement with drug organizations.

Maduro is himself a published Times contributor, with the paper running a column in 2014 blaming the country’s large-scale anti-government demonstrations on the country’s elite and the “one percent.”

The Times has previously defended its advertising policy to Breitbart News, maintaining that the company accepts advertisements in which groups or individuals comment on a “public or controversial issue” but refusing to comment on whether the Venezuelan government ads ever crossed any ethical boundaries.

310,Nicaraguan Catholic Church Demands Freedom of the Press,['Thomas D. Williams'],"The archbishop of Managua demanded Sunday the government of Daniel Ortega lift a block on paper and other raw materials from the opposition newspaper La Prensa.

Cardinal Leopoldo Brenes, who is also president of the Nicaraguan bishops’ conference, said that there has been a public outcry for the release of paper and other materials so that freedom of the press can be restored in the country.

While the online edition of La Prensa continues to be published, the print version has been severely curtailed because of the Sandinista government’s block on paper to the daily, which began 74 weeks ago. The newspaper has responded by reducing the number of pages in its daily edition and shifting to a tabloid format on weekends in an effort to maintain the paper’s regular publication.

“There has been a clamor not only from the population, but the Episcopal Conference has stated as well that paper must be released so that La Prensa can be published with its correct number of pages and an objective journalism can be exercised,” the cardinal said.

Brenes said that the circulation of La Prensa is important, while expressing his confidence that despite this blockade, the newspaper will continue to serve the truth.

“There is no doubt that the circulation of this newspaper is important. It is La Prensa. In one way or another it is always present,” the cardinal said following the celebration of Sunday mass at the Cristo Rey school in Managua.

In 2019, a team of journalists from Onda Local along with investigators from Transparencia Nicaragua carried out two inquiries and concluded that the Nicaraguan government is in violation of its own Law of Access to Public Information that was passed by the Ortega government in 2009.

The Managuan cardinal also referred Sunday to political prisoners who are still in Sandinista prisons and who recently started a hunger strike to press for their freedom.

“It is sad that these situations occur because a hunger strike always goes against life. Hopefully other measures can be sought so as to avoid this. I have always said that the outcry must be heard,” he said.

The cardinal urged the government to listen to the cry of the mothers of the political prisoners while expressing his hope that “we can soon have these people freed.”

According to the Civic Alliance for Justice and Democracy, the more than 65 political prisoners in La Modelo prison have been on hunger strike for 15 days and demanded that their rights be respected and as well as their freedom.

Cardinal Brenes concluded by saying that current human rights violations must not be repeated in Nicaragua.

“If there is a new system, I hope this will never be repeated. Sometimes you want to implement a democracy, but there are always these regimes that in the long run do not exercise the purity of democracy,” he said.

311,Conservatives in Dominican Republic Fear Becoming ‘Hostage’ to China’s Belt and Road,['Frances Martel'],"A senior leader of one of the Dominican Republic’s most prominent conservative political parties told Breitbart News he is concerned the island nation, just a little over 200 miles from the United States, could become a “hostage” in China’s growing bid for hegemony.

In an interview with Breitbart News, the vice president of the National Progressive Force – a socially conservative, pro-U.S., small government party – Pelegrín Castillo said recent remarks by Chinese Ambassador to the Dominican Republic Zhang Run urging the country to allow China to bid to develop one of the nation’s most strategic ports was alarming and shockingly disrespectful of the Republic’s internal affairs. Zhang is openly advocating for the country to open a public bidding war for the development of the Manzanillo Port, rather than sign an agreement with U.S. developers that would keep China’s “Belt and Road” workers out of the area.

“That project is very easy, it is not a large project, we have built the largest ports in the world, seven of the 10 largest are in China,” Zhang said in an interview in mid-January. “It’s a little port and since I arrived in the country they are talking about it.”

“For me, it is easy that they establish a project, that they [the Dominican government] convene a commercial, public, free, transparent bidding for all countries and that their companies participate according to the rules of the market,” he insisted. “In alliance with local companies, well, with all kinds of methodology, but that it gets done.”

Zhang also said that China had offered Santo Domingo a $600 million credit line to rebuild its increasingly faulty electric grid, but “the ball is in the Dominican court.”

“Chinese Ambassador Zhang Run erred in calling publicly for the Dominican government to accelerate a call for bidding on the Manzanillo Port [development], which is anchored in an area that is strategic for the security and development of the Island and the Region, virtually taking for granted that Chinese contractors would win that bidding with great ease,” Castillo told Breitbart News. “The base of the development of Manzanillo should be conceived and executed very carefully because, in addition to hosting a great port, it [is home to] several critical infrastructure establishments (shipyards, energy sector, industrial and commercial sector, and human settlements) valuable for the development of the Republic.”

“It also has strategic value for [national] security given its location. To undertake its development, there must be a national and international security vision,” Castillo emphasized.

The Manzanillo port is about 350 miles from Puerto Rico, the closest United States territory to it; it is about 450 miles from the Virgin Islands and about 725 miles from Key West.

Under its “Belt and Road” program, China has increasingly offered astronomical loan sums to developing countries at high interest rates, required the countries to use the money to pay Chinese workers to build infrastructure projects, then seized the infrastructure once the country could no longer pay back the loans. The archetypical case of this is the Hambantota port in Sri Lanka, which the Chinese now own, placing them off the shores of their closest geopolitical rival, India.

The Pentagon has warned that China is using “Belt and Road” to expand its military footprint around the world, including Latin America.

“China, without a doubt a great nation representing a very different culture, is in an expansionist phase unprecedented in its history, and the totalitarian nature of the regime that governs it is progressively leading it to struggle for world hegemony,” Castillo noted. For the Dominican Republic, China’s struggle to take over influence in regions close to the United States is “a high-danger scenario: the biggest [concern] of all that of … becoming hostages or sacrificial pieces on the game board.”

Maneuvers in Dominican politics, he continued, “are subtly promoting the ideological vision that it is an inescapable historical process that China becomes dominant.”

The Dominican Republic established diplomatic relations with China in April 2018, after 70 years of friendly ties with Taiwan, “with a total lack of strategic intelligence,” according to Castillo. Under its “One China” policy, China refuses to have any diplomatic links with a country that recognizes the reality of Taiwan’s sovereignty; Taiwan is an independent state that has never been a part of the People’s Republic of China. Beijing bullies other states, and international bodies like the United Nations, into ignoring this fact and treating Taiwan as a rogue province.

By October 2018, the Global Times, a Chinese state propaganda outlet, was celebrating the deluge of Chinese manufactured products and contractor jobs flooding the Dominican Republic.

“Advertisements for Huawei’s latest mobile phones are popping up on local streets, network projects by China Communications Construction Company are under construction, and Lenovo products are on display in electronics stores,” the Global Times beamed. Seeking even more Chinese investment, Dominican President Danilo Medina visited Beijing in November 2018.

Pressure to give up an agreement with Washington agencies to survey how much money and effort it would take to turn the Manzanillo Port area into a state-of-the-art industrial and tourist destination came soon after.

Castillo warned that he believes China is actively trying to become more present in the Caribbean “as a way to replicate the actions of the United States and other countries challenging the maritime expansion of the Asian power in the South China Sea.”

China illegally claims most of the South China Sea even after losing a case at the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague in 2016. Beijing has flooded parts of Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Brunei, and Malaysia with military infrastructure it is not legally allowed to build and routinely protests when the U.S. Navy sends warships into international waters in the sea, claiming them to be Chinese.

China’s aggressive expansion, Castillo concluded, requires the United States to “revisit deeply its relationship with the failed globalist ideology” and, in particular, strengthen ties in the Caribbean.

“[The Caribbean] is a region that urgently needs to rearticulate itself as a region,” Castillo said, “and for that, it is important to end the Cuban dictatorship and reconcile Cuba with democracy and liberty; to rescue with seriousness Haiti from its status as a failed state; to redefine the precarious status of Puerto Rico, and particularly, to avoid destabilizing the Dominican Republic and the imposition of a dictatorship sustained by a political and ideological alignment with China and its allies on the continent.”

312,Russia Awards ‘Order of Lenin’ to Venezuelan Dictator Nicolás Maduro,['Ben Kew'],"Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro received this year’s Order of Lenin award from the Russian government, the Epoch Times noted on Wednesday, before a crowd including American communists.

The award was presented by Yaroslav Listo, head of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation on youth policy on the final day of the “World Anti-Imperialist Congress.”

“We all have Lenin in our hearts,” Listo declared on handing out the award. “This is a commitment. A revolutionary commitment to building socialism in the 21st century.”

Once the highest award bestowed by the Soviet Union, Maduro joins a long line of communist spies, tyrants, and guerrilla fighters in being recognized for the immense suffering they have imposed on humanity.

Previous recipients include dictators such as Cuba’s Fidel Castro and North Korea’s Kim Il-Sung, as well as the likes of the Spaniard who assassinated Leon Trotsky, Ramon Mercader, and the British double agent for the Soviet Union Kim Philby.

Much like prior honorees, Maduro is largely responsible for the transformation of his country from one of the region’s most prosperous nations to a nation in a situation where millions of people have been forced to flee the country due to lack of the most basic living essentials such as food, medicine, and electricity.

In his acceptance speech, Maduro cited late Chinese dictator Mao Zedong, responsible for the deaths of around 50 million people, likely making him the greatest mass murderer in history.

“It is here that we are the vanguard of a model of socialism, of anti-imperialism that will transform the world for humanity,” Maduro declared. “Mao Zedong called U.S. Imperialism a paper tiger,” and said that “we will build the new world that is coming.”

According to the communist publication FightBack!News, which V events in detail, Maduro “shamed the human rights organizations of the world for not caring about the lives of Iraqis for the last seventeen years of U.S Imperialist murder, terrorism, and bombings.”

In a sign of solidarity to the U.S. delegation from the Freedom Road Socialist Organization, Maduro explained that he knows America well from his time working as a bus driver.

“I know the U.S well. I used to drive a bus from Boston to New York, to Philadelphia, to Washington DC.,” he explained. “I am not anti-American. I am anti-imperialist. We are anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist, anti-racist.”

Maduro was a professional bus driver before joining Hugo Chávez’s “revolution” and becoming foreign minister, then replacing him after his death.

It is not the first time that Maduro has received recognition for his destruction of Venezuela. As well as a range of Venezuelan awards presumably ordered by himself, he also has received awards from Cuba and Argentina.

He also holds the highest decoration in Palestine over his support for the anti-Zionist cause, while the dictator of Nicaragua Daniel Ortega and former President of Bolivia Evo Morales also awarded him their highest decorations as a signal of left-wing solidarity.

314,Venezuelan President Juan Guaidó Turns to Justin Trudeau,['Frances Martel'],"Venezuelan President Juan Guaidó continued a world tour banned by the socialist Maduro regime and landed in Canada on Sunday, where he has a scheduled meeting with leftist Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

According to Trudeau’s office, the president will discuss with Trudeau “the importance of democracy & the need for a peaceful, Venezuelan-led transition towards free & fair elections as soon as possible.

Guaidó has at press time met with Trudeau’s Foreign Minister François-Philippe Champagne and will soon meet Trudeau. His efforts in Canada are part of a larger world tour in which he first met with American Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Colombia, then headed to Europe to secure support from leaders in Spain, France, and the United Kingdom.

Guaidó is the president of Venezuela, and constitutionally assumed the position in January 2018 after the expiration of Nicolás Maduro’s term as president. Maduro has refused to leave power, claiming he is still president based on a highly fraudulent election in May 2017. The Venezuelan National Assembly, the last democratic institution in the country standing, appointed Guaidó interim president as the Venezuelan constitution requires, tasking him with the responsibility of organizing free and fair elections to replace Maduro. As Maduro still controls the military, Guaidó has failed to oust him and has little ability to exercise his legitimate powers.

Trudeau, whose left-wing administration has close ties to the Cuban government – which subsidizes and largely administers Venezuela on Maduro’s part –announced his discussion with Guaidó on Twitter.

On Monday, I’ll meet with @jguaido, the Interim President of Venezuela. We’ll talk about the importance of democracy & the need for a peaceful, Venezuelan-led transition toward free & fair elections as soon as possible. More on his visit to Ottawa: https://t.co/LaHPlIiIlm — Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) January 26, 2020

“Tomorrow we will meet to coordinate and take joint actions for freedom,” Guaido said in response, thanking Trudeau. “We have the opportunity to together recover democracy in Venezuela and consolidate the security of our continent.”

Canada recognized Guaidó as the legitimate president of Venezuela, as do most nations in the Western Hemisphere. About 50 countries recognize Guaidó nationwide; Maduro allies like Russia, China, and Iran do not, while many nations simply have not made a statement either way.

The Prime Minister’s Office issued a statement on Guaidó’s visit in which it reiterated that Canada recognizes Guaidó’s presidency. It also noted that Canada has joined the United States in imposing sanctions on dozens of Maduro regime officials.

“Canada has pledged its steadfast support for Interim President Juan Guaidó of Venezuela and has called for a peaceful, Venezuelan-led transition toward free and fair elections as soon as possible,” the statement read.

The statement also featured a remark from Trudeau himself, applauding Guaidó.

”I commend Interim President Guaidó for the courage and leadership he has shown in his efforts to return democracy to Venezuela, and I offer Canada’s continued support. Canadians stand with the people of Venezuela in their pursuit of free and fair elections and basic human rights,” Trudeau said.

During his meeting with Guaidó, Foreign Minister Champagne called it “an enormous honor” for Canada to be a stop on Guaidó’s tour. Guaidó reportedly discussed the human rights of the at least 400 known political prisoners Maduro is holding captive and his imminent return to Venezuela, where Maduro could potentially move to arrest him. Despite having no official power, Maduro imposed a travel ban on Guaidó last year, which he thwarted crossing the border into Colombia. Guaidó did not risk going through a Venezuelan airport and Maduro-obeying security there.

“We worked to take joint actions to rescue human dignity in Venezuela, which is being assaulted by the dictatorship, and recover Democracy and Freedom,” Guaidó said of his meeting with the top diplomat.

Neither party offered specifics on what joint measures they would take to help restore freedom or remove Maduro.

Guaidó exited Venezuela to galvanize international support for his presidency following a turbulent start to the year in Caracas for him. As the year began and the National Assembly prepared to re-elect him as legislative president, his title before assuming the interim presidency, Maduro deployed Bolivarian National Guard troops to block Guaidó from entering his own office. Guaidó initially tried to shove his way through fully-equipped riot police in only a suit, easily expelled from outside the National Assembly headquarters. In the meantime, and alleged member of the opposition, Luis Parra, attempted to swear himself in as legislative president. On the second day of such turmoil, Guaidó succeeded in climbing over the bodies of National Guard troops with the help of a much larger crowd who assembled to prevent Maduro’s armed men from blocking Guaidó.

Guaidó retained his National Assembly presidency and shortly thereafter traveled to Colombia, where he met with Pompeo.

“For the Venezuelan people, I want you to know that your President is a great leader who wants to take your country in the right direction – the direction of freedom, democracy, to restore economic prosperity,” Pompeo told reporters during his meeting with the Venezuelan head of state. “You should know that countries across the world – in Latin America where we are today, in Colombia, in Europe, the United States, all across North America – the people, the democratic people of those countries are with you.”

315,Brazil Demands Britain Extradite 'The Pablo Escobar of Eggs',['Ben Kew'],"Authorities in Brazil demanded the United Kingdom extradite a man dubbed the “Pablo Escobar of Eggs” on charges of the attempted trafficking of endangered falcon eggs.

Jeffrey Lendrum, 58, made a living for three decades by smuggling fragile eggs from the nests of rare birds of prey to wealthy international clients.

Having been arrested five times across three different continents, Lendrum finally faced retribution when he was arrested at London’s Heathrow Airport in possession of 19 eggs worth approximately £100,000.

After being searched, police found that Lendrum was wearing a sling made from bandages under his clothes that were concealing and keeping warm 19 eggs belonging to vultures, falcons, and kites as well as two newborn African fish eagle chicks.

He was recently sentenced by British courts to three years and one month in prison. However, authorities in Brazil are seeking to extradite him to face further charges over his arrest in 2015 when he attempted to board a flight from Sāo Paulo to Johannesburg with eggs of peregrine falcons.

Prolific wildlife criminal, Jeffrey Lendrum, has today been sentenced to three years and one month in jail after being apprehended at Heathrow Airport with 9 rare eggs and two newly-hatched chicks strapped to his body. Congratulations to all involved! #WildlifeCrime pic.twitter.com/vPVmN698yk — ifaw United Kingdom (@IFAWUK) January 10, 2019

He appeared at Westminster Crown Court on Wednesday via videolink from HMP Wandsworth for an initial extradition hearing. His lawyer, Florence Iveson, protested with the judge that his client would be placed in a cell with over 20 other prisoners, each entitled around 2.25 square meters of personal space.

As well as their poor conditions, Brazilian prisons are also notorious for their shocking levels of violence, with rivalries between the country’s drug gangs leading to regular outbreaks of rioting that have left hundreds dead and seriously wounded.

“In the history of Brazilian extradition matters, there has been a failure to ultimately provide suitable assurances,” Iveson said.

Lendrum is wanted by Brazilian authorities for skipping bail in 2016 after being handed a jail sentence of four years and six months’ jail time for his smuggling activities. He was previously jailed for 30 months by Warwick Crown Court after being caught similarly trying to smuggle peregrine falcon eggs from Birmingham airport to Dubai.

Many of Lendrum’s clients live in the Middle East, where peregrine falcon’s and other rare types of bird can be sold for tens of thousands of dollars. A former member of the Rhodesian army’s special forces, he once carried out a dramatic egg heist from a helicopter. He is well known by conservationists around the world and is the subject of a book by Josh Hammer entitled The Falcon Thief.

Jeffrey Lendrum’s coat was unseasonably heavy. He was carrying nine rare birds’ eggs, worth up to a total of £100,000. What is it like to be a bird smuggler? Read more: https://t.co/R9mPCJg9Ev pic.twitter.com/gKkJHIscnf — Financial Times (@FinancialTimes) March 29, 2019

316,Colombian Man in Wuhan: We’ve Known of Deadly Virus for a Month,['Frances Martel'],"A Wuhan resident from Bogotá told Colombian newspaper El Tiempo on Thursday that residents of the Chinese metropolis were aware of a flu-like illness spreading “before 2019 ended,” weeks before the Communist Party publicly revealed an outbreak of a newly documented deadly coronavirus.

The Chinese communist regime officially alerted the World Health Organization (WHO) of a mystery virus on December 31 but state media were insisting the virus was “no need to panic” as recently as last week. Authorities announced they had sequenced the virus’s genome and shared it with global health professionals on Monday.

As of Friday, 26 people have died after being exposed to the virus and over 900 tested positive as carriers. Anonymous reports from doctors and other medical professionals in Wuhan suggest that Communist Party officials are actively refusing to document suspected cases, rejecting patients with symptoms requesting virus testing, and identifying some victims as simply carrying “pneumonia” without noting an origin.

Wuhan police have also “handled” eight cases of individuals sharing information about the virus on social media, without elaborating on the fate of these people or how they “handled” the cases. The police instead threatened locals to stay silent online.

The virus causes respiratory illness – fever, cough, body aches, and other traditional cold symptoms. Many patients are later diagnosed with pneumonia as a result of the disease.

In an attempt to appear diligent in protecting the population of the central regional capital from the new health threat, the Party has instituted a lockdown on Wuhan and seven other cities, most near the epicenter of the disease. Wuhan is a city of 11 million people; its greater metropolitan area is home to nearly 20 million. Wuhan is also a pivotal transportation hub for the country, home to a highly trafficked international airport and a connecting stop for the nation’s sprawling railway system.

In his remarks to El Tiempo, Colombian student Carlos Oliveros suggests that the disease has hovered over the city for weeks. Oliveros, one of a very small number of Latin Americans in the city, has lived in Wuhan for six months as a graduate student at the University of Wuhan. He remains on campus and described a state of total surveillance in which nearly every building he enters has installed temperature scanners and health officials are going door-to-door reading security protocol.

“Carlos began to hear, before the end of 2019, of a strong cold that had struck some in Wuhan in the middle of the winter,” the Colombian newspaper reported. “Rain is constant and temperatures reach zero degrees (celsius) during the nights, so the sickness appeared normal at the time.”

He noted that authorities first responded by shutting down a popular seafood and live game market now believed to be the location where the virus first jumped from animal meat to humans. The market has been closed since January 1. By this week, health officials had placed temperatures scanners in nearly every public area and shut down restaurants and other public spaces.

“There are scanners in every public place, every time you enter an establishment you have to go through these body temperature measuring devices,” Oliveros told the newspaper. “Before you go into a public area they make you go through. I think it’s something similar to the fear that Colombia went through during H1N1 [commonly known as Swine Flu, spreading in Colombia in 2018], but here they take more serious measures.”

Oliveros noted that only campus restaurants appear to be open and that the city is largely desolate, but that Wuhan often empties out for the Lunar New Year. As it is a major economic hub, many residents are transplants who return to their families for the biggest celebration of the year. Oliveros noted that while he only knew of three other Colombians in the city, Wuhan is “one of the most multicultural cities in the country, frequented by Arabs, Africans, Russians, Spaniards, and Thais.”

The diverse nature of the city has put the world on high alert. As of Friday, the virus has spread to many other countries of Asia, including Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, and South Korea. Italy and the United States have also confirmed cases.

Suspicions that a stronger response on the part of Beijing could have avoided such a global concern have surfaced, particularly in light of the fact that health officials considered the virus enough of a threat to alert the WHO in December and shut down the suspect market at the end of the new year, but still organized enormous public gatherings that could facilitate an epidemic. On January 18, 19 days after considering the virus enough of a problem to bring it to the attention of the global public health governing body, the Baibuting neighborhood of Wuhan organized its 20th annual Lunar New Year dinner, bringing together 40,000 families who cooked and brought from their homes 13,986 different dishes.

The sharing of food and drink by tens of thousands of people in close quarters could significantly strengthen the probability of an epidemic in the face of a present communicable disease. Even more alarming, the dinner caters to older “empty nesters” whose children are not in Wuhan for the holiday, meaning a high concentration of potential high-risk patients.

Multiple anonymous reports from health workers in Wuhan have also undermined Beijing’s insistence it is managing the outbreak properly. Speaking to the South China Morning Post, unnamed doctors said they did not have the proper equipment to handle the high volume of patients and that their superiors did not properly warn them of the threat of the virus spreading from human to human. The result: a much larger number of health workers infected than the 15 the Chinese regime alleges and a hospital where many patients interned for other reasons were not adequately protected from exposure to coronavirus carriers.

The American outlet Radio Free Asia (RFA) also reported on the bizarre death of Chinese environmentalist Xu Dapeng this week of “pneumonia.” Xu and his wife, who died ten days before him, reportedly shared symptoms with coronavirus carriers, but doctors refused to test either of them or their daughter, who is still alive. Hospital officials told the daughter, who asked specifically to receive testing for the new virus, that they could not test walk-in patients, only those hospital officials had approved. Xu and his wife are not among the 26 official deaths on record.

“Hospitals and authorities said the spread of the disease is no cause for panic and none was witnessed in the affected cities and hospitals that were visited by reporters has been felt at the scenes,” the Global Times, a state propaganda outlet, declared last week.

“There is no need to overreact. If you haven’t been in contact with someone with a fever or haven’t been to Wuhan, there is little chance you will get infected,” an unnamed nurse said in the newspaper.

The WHO praised China for its alleged transparency in a press statement on Thursday.

“I would like to thank the Government of the People’s Republic of China for its cooperation and transparency. The government has been successful in isolating and sequencing the virus very quickly, and has shared that genetic sequence with WHO and the international community,” WHO Secretary-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters. “This outbreak was detected because China had put in place a system specifically to pick up severe lower respiratory infections. It was that system that caught this event.”

317,Alleged al-Qaeda Jihadis Caught Trying to Enter U.S. with Fake Passports,['Frances Martel'],"American authorities identified and apprehended three Syrian nationals accused of belonging to al-Qaeda in Dallas, Texas, from Colombia, the Colombian news agency RCN reported on Thursday, publishing images of the three individuals’ fake passports.

According to RCN, American law enforcement identified the three individuals as Al Raefee, Tuameh Tuameh, and Al Harari Al Harari. The three are believed to be in U.S. custody, soon to be charged with membership in a terrorist organization. The men appear to have entered Colombia through Venezuela, where they acquired Colombian residency paperwork, a government identification card, and a Colombian passport through an illegal documentation network.

Journalist Luis Carlos Vélez published images of the counterfeit passports on Twitter, noting that the men appeared to have crossed into Colombia through the La Guajira border crossing with Venezuela. Reports have not yet specified how the Syrians entered Venezuela or how long they had spent in the country after leaving Syria. Vélez reportedly stated that the U.S. embassy identified them as al-Qaeda terrorists when they attempted to procure U.S. visas, which does not align with the RCN report that police arrested them in Dallas. The RCN report does not note if Dallas authorities arrested them at the airport, which would suggest the men did receive U.S. visas and got onboard a flight to the country, or if they arrived by other means.

American authorities reportedly suspected criminal activity after inspecting the passports and finding several irregularities. The identification numbers on all three passports, RCN noted, did not match their birthdates. Colombian passports assign numbers to citizens based on when they were born. Although the youngest of the three men is 45 years old according to his passport, the identification number on his passport corresponded to a much more recently born person, at most 25 years old.

All three passports were also produced on the same exact date and stamped “La Guajira,” the Colombian state bordering Venezuela where it is believed they traveled to from Venezuela. The passports also stated that all three men were born in Cartagena, Colombia.

RCN reported that Colombian authorities have traced the falsified documents back to an “illicit network” of organized criminals who produce high-quality counterfeit documentation to help criminals evade arrest. While not citing any government officials confirming the existence of the network of an investigation into it, RCN claimed that the network had helped over 1,200 foreign citizens – Cubans, Afghans, Israelis, Iraqis, Chinese, Vietnamese, Africans, and Ecuadorians – obtain fake Colombian documents.

The arrest follows years of extensive evidence linking Venezuela’s socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro to jihadist groups, though Maduro is more typically accused of being allied with the Shiite terrorist group Hezbollah, not the Sunni group al-Qaeda. The two terrorist organizations are rivals who occasionally cooperate against the United States. Among the most notable such cooperations is the help that the September 11, 2001, al-Qaeda terrorists received from Hezbollah’s master government in Iran to enter the country.

Maduro’s regime has long faced accusations of helping Syrian, Iranian, and Iraqi jihadists obtain legitimate Venezuelan documents they could later use to travel more freely in the Western Hemisphere, despite not being Venezuelan citizens or having any ties to the country. In 2015, Spanish journalist Emili Blasco revealed that Maduro visited Damascus in 2007, then serving as Hugo Chávez’s foreign minister, and met with Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah to come to an agreement on “drug trafficking, money laundering, the distribution of arms and issuing of passports … to terrorists.” Blasco identified a Hezbollah operative known as Ghazi Nasr al Din as the chief architect of the passport scheme, responsible for at least 300 Hezbollah members acquiring paperwork to enter the United States.

Following that report, a former official at the Venezuelan embassy in Baghdad, Misael López Soto, fled Iraq after posting an explosive video to social media denouncing the illegal purchase of Venezuelan legal documents by an assortment of Middle Eastern individuals with no ties to the country. López said that essentially any Middle Eastern local could purchase Venezuelan birth certificates or passports for $10,000 to $15,000.

Two years later, the former head of the Office of Identification and Migration (Saime) revealed that as many as 10,000 Syrians, Iranians, and others were actively using Venezuelan paperwork to travel.

The issue also surfaced in the 2016 document leak known as the “Panama Papers.” Those documents revealed that the communist government of Cuba put up much of the money necessary to print the documents.

No direct link exists at press time between the Hezbollah scheme to print Venezuelan documents and the alleged illegal ring printing falsified Colombian documents. Venezuelan opposition members nonetheless condemned Maduro for creating a permissive atmosphere for jihadists in the country.

“Another example that Nicolás Maduro has become the greatest protector and promoter of international terrorism,” Julio Borges, the head of Venezuelan President Juan Guaidó’s foreign policy, said. “From Venezuela, irregular groups have total impunity to plan criminal operations. It is a real threat for the entire free world.”

318,Homicides in Rio de Janeiro Drop to Lowest Level in Nearly 30 Years,['Ben Kew'],"Homicides in the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro have fallen to their lowest level in nearly 30 years when the government began keeping records, according to new figures released on Tuesday by Brazil’s Public Security Institute.

Over the course of 2019, there were 3,995 cases of intentional homicide, compared to 5,346 in 2017. Homicides on record peaked at 8,483 in 1995. Two of the five areas with the greatest reduction are in the city of Rio de Janeiro, while three others are in different cities across the state.

Melina Risso, program director at the security think tank the Igarapé Institute, told the Brazilian newspaper El Globo that the fall could be attributed to a number of factors that need to be further investigated.

“The result may be related to investments made in federal [government] intervention in public security and the number of weapons seizures,” she explained. “These are factors that still need to be further studied.”

The figures will come as a further boost to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who swept to power in late 2018 on promises to radically reduce crime and improve public security by providing greater authorities to the police and the military. This pledge strongly resonated with voters given that 2017 was the country’s most violent year in recent history, with around 60,000 homicides nationwide amid brutal warfare between rival drug cartels and criminal gangs.

Bolsonaro was himself a major victim of Brazil’s wave of violent crime after he was nearly fatally stabbed by a self-proclaimed socialist during a public rally in the city of Juiz de Fora near Rio de Janeiro in September 2018. After spending a month in the hospital, he was eventually allowed to return home but could not return to the campaign trail and needed multiple surgeries to prevent further injury.

Last August, the 64-year-old former army captain was also boosted by news that the country as a whole had seen a 20 percent fall in homicides just four months into his presidency. Figures released by Brazil’s Ministry of Justice documented 13,142 reported homicides from January to April 2019, compared to 16,670 during the same period in 2018.

The latest statistics also determined that the number of people killed in confrontations with police had reached record levels, with 1,810 cases over the past year, an average of five a day. This is the highest number recorded since 1998 when records of such data began. The rise could be a result of security forces having more authority to shoot suspected criminals who do not surrender, a policy that Bolsonaro has actively encouraged.

319,U.N.: Russia Has Displaced Nearly a Million Syrians Since December,['Frances Martel'],"The United Nations Humanitarian Affairs office warned on Monday that nearly a million Syrian civilians from northwest Idlib province had been displaced in a Russia-backed offensive there by dictator Bashar al-Assad that began in December.

Idlib is the last stronghold of the anti-Assad rebel movement in the country. Assad has been at war with the rebels since 2011 and has been repeatedly accused of using chemical weapons against civilians and other human rights atrocities to cement his control over regions that oppose his rule. Conversely, rebel groups have faced allegations that they have cooperated with Sunni jihadist organizations, as the anti-Assad movement largely consists of Arab Sunnis opposed to the Shiite Alawite rule in Damascus.

While the struggle between Assad and Sunni rebels lies at the heart of the Syrian Civil War, as many as ten different factions have participated in violence in the country during the war, often unrelated to Assad such as the failed establishment of the Islamic State caliphate in Raqqa or clashes between the northern Syrian Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG/YPJ) and the Turkish military. Turkey claims to oppose Assad’s rule but has instead focused its energy on fighting the Kurds, who have not had any significant interaction with Assad’s army and instead largely contributed to the demise of ISIS.

The vacuum left by the fall of ISIS in the country has allowed Assad, along with allies Iran and Russia, to focus on attacking Idlib.

“The violence in north-west Syria is indiscriminate,” Mark Lowcock, U.N. Humanitarian Affairs chief, said on Monday. “We are now receiving reports that settlements for displaced people are being hit, resulting in deaths, injuries and further displacement.”

Refugees from the region “are traumatized and forced to sleep outside in freezing temperatures because camps are full,” he noted. “Mothers are burning plastic to keep children warm … babies and small children are dying because of the cold.”

Lowcock added that schools, hospitals, and other critical infrastructure has been destroyed. Exposure to nature while fleeing also leaves open the potential of a significant public health crisis in the event of disease spreading, he added.

He estimated that 900,000 people had been displaced since December 1. A week ago, the number of displaced in the region stood at 690,000 since December 1, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which estimated it was the largest number of displaced people in a single period of the Syrian Civil War. The sum is particularly jarring given that the U.N. estimates the Idlib region is home to 3 million people.

Lowcock urged U.N. Security Council action and a ceasefire to protect civilians.

Anadolu Agency, the state news agency of anti-Assad Turkey, claimed this week that the number was much higher – nearly 2 million displaced from Idlib since January. Anadolu claimed that rebels and Assad troops had declared a ceasefire recently that Assad had not respected; President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has threatened more military action against Assad in the near future.

As of this week, the United Nations estimates that over 5.6 million people have left Syria since the war began in 2011. Another 6.6 million are internally displaced, meaning they have lost their homes to the war and are either living homeless in cities or living in overcrowded refugee camps. The vast majority of those, over 3 million, who have left the country have fled to Turkey. Others in the new wave of displaced have fled to Manbij, Syrian Kurdistan. Local forces affiliated with the Kurdish fighters there have reported numbers too large to count of incoming refugees this month.

The Russian government has previously responded to United Nations reports on its atrocities in Syria by dismissing their information as false.

“They say the particular date a school or a hospital was destroyed in a particular region. They give coordinates. Our people start to double-check this and they find that there is no hospital with such coordinates, there is no school with such coordinates and the day which is mentioned by the U.N. humanitarian agencies, on this day, the Russian air force did not act at all,” Russian United Nations representative Gennady Gatilov complained in August, in response to yet another U.N. report accusing Moscow of helping Assad attack civilians. Gatilov claimed that biased NGOs on the ground provided the U.N. with misinformation.

This week, Russia has focused instead of accusing the United States of human rights violations.

“The oil fields … are controlled by the U.S. There’s shameless, impudent pillage of the wealth that belongs to Syria and the Syrian people taking place,” Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu claimed in Rome this week, referring to territories liberated from the Islamic State and managed by Syrian Kurdish groups.

The Assad regime’s state propaganda outlet, the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA), claimed that, rather than terrorizing civilians, Assad has instead created a “humanitarian corridor” in Idlib for those who wish to leave.

“SANA reporter said that tens of citizens, most of them women, children, and elderly persons, exited through the humanitarian corridor established by the Syrian Arab Army west the liberated city of Ma’arat al-Nu’man, coming from the areas where the terrorists are positioned,” the outlet reported. SANA uses the term “liberated” to refer to cities under Assad control.

SANA also claimed Assad was providing medicine and food.

320,Lebanese Mock Hezbollah Chief Nasrallah's U.S. Boycott,['John Hayward'],"Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Iran-backed Lebanese terrorist organization Hezbollah, on Sunday called for a boycott of American goods to protest President Donald Trump’s Middle East peace plan.

Lebanese citizens spent the next few days mocking Nasrallah online by pointing out how much Hezbollah relies on American goods and the U.S. dollar.

“Why are we not resorting to boycotting American products? This is part of the battle. If we do not want to boycott all goods, we choose some companies, and this is a form of confrontation,” Nasrallah said in a televised speech on Sunday.

“The Israeli is afraid of death while the American’s weakness is his security and economy,” he added.

Nasrallah’s speech, presented as a commemoration of slain Hezbollah members and the late Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, included strident demands for Lebanese to support the government.

Massive protests have rocked Lebanon since October, forcing the resignation of Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri and threatening Hezbollah’s grip on power. The appointment of new Prime Minister Hassan Diab has not mollified the protesters, prompting many observers to label the new Lebanese administration as dead on arrival. Demonstrators continue denouncing the Lebanese political elite, rampant corruption, and the influence of Iran through its proxies in Hezbollah.

The Jerusalem Post last week quoted Lebanese activists who said Hezbollah has lost its appeal as a “resistance” movement against supposed Israeli domination because Lebanese are more worried about their crumbling economy and collapsing government than they are about Israel or the Palestinians.

As one anti-government Lebanese protester told the Jerusalem Post, “We don’t trust Hezbollah, as it’s a partner of the current political game. They manipulated us.”

Nasrallah attempted to push back against these criticisms in his Sunday speech by insisting the new Hezbollah-backed government in Beirut deserves applause for its courage, rather than condemnation before it has a chance to accomplish anything.

“We must laud the government’s PM and ministers for their courage to shoulder responsibility, because we will face difficult and sensitive circumstances. The situation is very difficult and I call for separating the financial and economic file from the political conflict in the country and leaving aside the settling of scores,” he said.

Nasrallah claimed, “This is not Hezbollah’s government, although Hezbollah backs it and wants it to succeed.” He accused those who “call for despair” of “committing national treason.”

Sarcastic responses to Nasrallah’s speech began within hours of its delivery. Iraq-Lebanese columnist Hussain Abdul-Hussain said Nasrallah’s call for a boycott of U.S. goods, ostensibly on behalf of the Palestinians, was utterly out of touch with the concerns of most Lebanese.

“This shows how dangerously delusional Iran and its militias are. Here, Hezbollah’s Nasrallah calls on Lebanon to boycott U.S. products. He doesn’t understand that an economy in free fall, like Lebanon, cannot exert boycotts [or] economic pressure on anyone, let alone America,” Abdul-Hussain said on Twitter.

Online sarcasm flourished on Monday and Tuesday, with Lebanese critics of Nasrallah pointing out that his own son has been photographed wearing American clothes.

Al-Arabiya described and contextualized some other bits of online pushback:

Dima Sadek, a Shia Lebanese journalist, shared a meme depicting cartoon character Tom from “Tom and Jerry” as a neighborhood spy speaking in a dialect from southern Lebanon, an area that is predominately Shia. He’s talking about someone named Abbas, a common Shia name. He says, “Peace be upon you Hajj, Abbas is smoking Marlboro.” Twitter user Ma3lick’s Wrist responded to the call for boycott with several questions. “What about all the payment in US dollar? Is that halal? Why don’t they use the Iranian currency?” Cynthia Karam, Lebanese Twitter user, sarcastically wrote in Arabic “If I see any Hezbollah member carrying an iPhone, I will complain about him to Nasrallah.”

Hezbollah unveiled a huge statue of Soleimani along the border with Israel on Saturday, depicting the Iranian terror master standing next to a Palestinian flag and pointing at Israel to signify the determination of Hezbollah and Iran to “liberate Palestine from Israeli occupation,” as Middle East Monitor put it. The “statue” was promptly mocked by Lebanese who said it appeared to be made out of cardboard.

As Middle East Monitor pointed out, Lebanese protesters are unlikely to be thrilled by Hezbollah’s message that it wants to drag Lebanon into a war with Israel on behalf of the Palestinians.

The National Interest on Monday saw Nasrallah and Hezbollah as clearly on the defensive, desperately trying to protect their wealth and political influence against a remarkably broad-based protest movement. The steady erosion of Hezbollah influence that began when the group collaborated with Iranian client Syria to assassinate Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri has accelerated despite Nasrallah’s efforts to distract the public by railing against U.S. and Israeli conspiracies, while Hezbollah’s habit of using violence against protesters certainly is not endearing it to the restless Lebanese public.

Rafik Hariri’s son Saad, incidentally, did not depart from Lebanese political life when he resigned as prime minister. Saad Hariri gave his own major public address on Friday, the first since his resignation on October 29 and the 15th anniversary of his father’s assassination, vowing to remain active in his Future Movement party and defending “Haririism” against what he saw as unfair efforts to scapegoat his family’s political philosophy for the failures of a corrupt elite.

“Iran’s cash can solve the problems of a party, not of a country,” Hariri said in a swipe at his Iran-backed political adversaries.",https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/02/18/lebanese-mock-hezbollah-chiefs-u-s-boycott/
321,"Netanyahu Unveils Massive Financial Reforms with Cheaper Housing, Healthcare Boosts",['Deborah Danan'],"JERUSALEM – Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his newly tapped candidate for finance minister, Likud MK Nir Barkat, on Sunday unveiled a wide-ranging financial plan that includes more hospitals and cheaper housing and food, set to be put into place if Likud wins next month’s elections.

The plan, Netanyahu said, would also see more investments in Israel’s periphery, including the Negev, Galilee and the West Bank, as well as investments in small and medium-sized businesses and start-ups.

“The first thing is to drastically reduce food prices in the country,” Netanyahu said at a press briefing at the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. “Currently, food prices [in Israel] are 30 percent higher than in the rest of the world. We will tear down monopolies and decentralize the [food] market.”

“Second thing is to drastically reduce housing prices. We will cut bureaucracy significantly. Sixty percent of the price of an apartment in Israel today is the price of land and taxes,” he said.

A third reform would be in healthcare, Netanyahu added, with the construction of new hospitals and increasing the number of beds in existing hospitals by at least 700.

“We have to cut waiting lines. In a few years, we will no longer see patients lying in hospital corridors – this is unacceptable,” he said.

Barkat said 400,000 new jobs would be created over the next decade in the periphery.

“The idea is to provide a child from the periphery the same level of education a child living in the center of the country receives,” he said.

“We need to help them, we need to tear down barriers and give them certainty. It will require us to do three things: freeze property taxes for five years, reform business licensing and equaling the social conditions of freelance workers in Israel [to employees working on a salary].”

He added that the government would invest heavily in the hi-tech sectors.

“Israel must be a leading player in future technologies. We, in Israel, have a huge potential when it comes to biotechnology and medicine. The same goes for robotics and public transport. Intel has made Israel their international autonomous vehicle hub. We have more ventures and startups that can definitely change the world.”",https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/02/18/netanyahu-unveils-massive-financial-reforms-with-cheaper-housing-healthcare-boosts/
322,Bernie Sanders Ad Touts Him As ‘First Jewish President’,['Joel B. Pollak'],"LAS VEGAS, Nevada — A new video ad released Sunday by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) touts him as the potential “first Jewish American president.”

In the 2016 campaign, Sanders downplayed his Jewish origins, with an ad that referred to him as the “son of a Polish immigrant who grew up in a Brooklyn tenement.”

But in 2020, amidst claims that has has aligned himself with left-wing antisemites and has an anti-Israel foreign policy, is he is trying a different tack.

The new Internet ad, “Bernie Would Be the First Jewish President,” runs for over two minutes.

It begins with teen climate activist Jamie Margolin declaring: “If Bernie Sanders was elected, he would be our first Jewish American president. As a Jewish American, that would be a huge step forward in this country and blowback against the rise of antisemitism in this country.”

The video then shows Sanders lighting a Chanukah menorah, and later shows footage of neo-Nazis chanting in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017.

Margolin says it would be “so satisfying” to have “a Jew literally replace them,” implying that President Donald Trump is among the neo-Nazis.

The video includes a misleading clip of President Trump’s press conference on Charlottesville, invoking what has come to be known as the “very fine people” hoax. (Trump did not refer to the neo-Nazis as “very fine people”; rather, he said they should be “condemned totally.”)

Other clips also seek to associate Trump with crimes by neo-Nazis.

Margolin — described as “part Latinx, part Jewish, all queer” in a recent interview — goes on to denounce “the Trump administration’s antisemitism.” It does not acknowledge the administration’s actual record on Jews and Israel.

The video closes with footage of Sanders speaking to J Street, a radical left-wing group whose positions are often described as anti-Israel.

Sanders includes among his surrogates and supporters several left-wing activists who are considered — even by many Democrats — to be antisemites, including Linda Sarsour, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).

Last year, the Sanders campaign backed British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is widely considered an antisemite and who led his party to defeat in December, partly for that reason.

Sanders’s policy on the Middle East is considered the most anti-Israel of all the Democratic candidates running — standing out even in a field that is markedly more hostile to the Jewish State than any in recent presidential primary history.

He has said he would consider moving the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem back to Tel Aviv, and that he would use U.S. aid to Israel — often an embattled outpost of democracy — as “leverage.”

323,Taliban Commander: Our Leaders Said Nothing About a Ceasefire,['John Hayward'],"Taliban militants attacked a military base in the northern Kunduz province, Afghanistan, on Sunday despite reports during the week that a ceasefire deal between the Taliban and U.S. is under negotiation.

Afghan officials on Friday announced the death of a Taliban deputy commander in a precision airstrike and thwarted several suicide bombings on Monday.

According to Afghan officials, the attack on the Kunduz base lasted several hours and “martyred” five Afghan army troops, plus three others injured, with an unknown number of casualties on the Taliban side.

The Taliban claimed 19 Afghan security troops were killed, four armored personnel carriers were destroyed, and a large amount of weapons and gear were stolen from the base.

The Afghan Ministry of Defense said a precision airstrike on Friday night killed seven militants, including Jalal Sirat, deputy commander of the Taliban’s “Red Unit” and Ahmadullah Taloqani, a senior Taliban commander in the Takhar district.

The Red Unit is an elite Taliban commando force, better armed and apparently much better trained than most other Taliban fighters or most of the Afghan military, for that matter. They are reportedly equipped with stolen top-shelf U.S. and Russian weapons and gear.

In November, they carried out a string of deadly raids that killed dozens of Afghan troops during a 36-hour period. The U.S. military responded with an airstrike in early December that killed the Red Unit commander, Mullah Shah Wali.

On Monday, the Afghan military reported capturing two Taliban terrorists and four suicide vests during operations in Kabul and Kandahar.

Radio Free Europe reported on Monday that both Afghan officials and Taliban representatives spoke as if ceasefire details are still being hammered out and the agreement could be signed as early as the end of February:

Afghanistan’s Chief Executive Officer Abdullah Abdullah told a meeting of ministers on February 17 that the Taliban has agreed to a seven-day reduction of violence ahead of a peace deal with the United States that was “finalized” and may be signed as soon as February 29. It was not immediately clear when the reduction in violence was scheduled to begin. A Taliban spokesman based in Doha, the capital of Qatar, said an agreement between the the militants and the United States will be signed by the end of the month. “According to the agreement, all foreign troops will leave Afghanistan,” Suhail Shaheen, told the DPA German news via the WhatsApp messaging service. “We will not allow anyone to use Afghanistan’s land [to launch attacks] against another country.” Some 5,000 Taliban prisoners are to be released following the signing of the agreement and before the beginning of intra-Afghan negotiations, Shaheen added.

“Our leadership hasn’t conveyed any message about a ceasefire to use,” a Taliban commander in the southern Helmand province grumbled to Reuters on Monday. Several other Taliban officers said they planned to continue launching attacks.

The current word from Washington is that a full peace deal with the Taliban will only be implemented if a 7-day “reduction in violence” agreement can be successfully implemented first. Voice of America News on Monday quoted Taliban sources who said the reduction in violence agreement would go into effect on February 22, making it possible to sign the full peace deal after seven (presumably successful) days on February 29.",https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/02/17/taliban-commander-our-leaders-said-nothing-about-ceasefire/
324,Hezbollah’s Nasrallah Demands Boycott of U.S. Products,['Simon Kent'],"Hezbollah’s Hassan Nasrallah has called for Lebanese citizens to strike at the heart of U.S. global success and boycott its goods and products as “part of the battle” to prove Islamic superiority.

The terrorist leader said in a televised speech on Sunday he has pinpointed “America’s weakness” and that is its vulnerability to a boycott of manufactured goods. Al-Arabiya network reports he said Lebanese everywhere can lead the way:

Why are we not resorting to boycotting American products? This is part of the battle. If we do not want to boycott all goods, we choose some companies, and this is a form of confrontation. The Israeli is afraid of death while the American’s weakness is his security and economy.

The call for a Lebanese boycott comes as the country finds itself in economic freefall.

The Lebanese pound has been officially pegged to the U.S. dollar since 1997 but it has lost a third of its value on the parallel market in the past 12 months, demolishing local markets and robbing Lebanese of their life savings while a run on the banks is now underway.

Lebanon staggers under one of the highest debt ratios in the world, at $86 billion or more than 150 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has been so successful in imposing an “unprecedented” economic pressure campaign on Iran that is forcing its proxy Hezbollah to beg for spare change, as Breitbart News reported.

In March last year, Nasrallah went on TV and made a public appeal for donations. To that end Hezbollah placed piggy banks in grocery stores and in retail outlets seeking the spare change of people.

The narco-terrorist group Hezbollah is heavily involved in lucrative drug trade and money laundering activities across the Western Hemisphere, particularly Latin America, however even that network is now drying up as U.S. sanctions bite.",https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/02/17/hezbollahs-nasrallah-demands-lebanon-boycott-u-s-goods-part-of-the-battle-of-islamic-superiority/
325,U.S. Jewish Leaders Visit Saudi Arabia in ‘Important’ Step for Israel,['Deborah Danan'],"TEL AVIV – A delegation of 55 major U.S. Jewish leaders traveled to Saudi Arabia last week in what was hailed as a “big step forward” in the kingdom’s warming ties with Israel.

The Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations delegation was the first such visit to Saudi Arabia by an American Jewish organization since 1993, when an American Jewish Congress delegation arrived in the kingdom to endorse the Oslo agreements.

“We just came back from a very important trip to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It was the first such trip we have had to the kingdom and we feel it was very productive. Very encouraging,” said Conference of Presidents chairman Arthur Stark in a press conference in Jerusalem alongside executive vice president Malcolm Hoenlein and CEO William Daroff.

Members of the delegation held meetings with senior Saudi officials as well as with Mohammed al-Issa, the secretary-general of the Muslim World League, a close aide to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

“We had an open dialogue. We met with high-level officials and raised our concerns, they raised their concerns, and we firmly believe that this a step in a long and productive relationship,” Stark said, noting that the talks, which discussed Iran’s nuclear ambitions and combating terrorism in the region, were off record.

“We’ve been engaging extensively with Gulf states over the course of a number of years. I think that this is a big step forward in it,” he said, adding that “it mirrors other visits that we have had with Gulf states where the embrace of Israel is clearly already there.”

Hoenlein would not directly answer whether the visit signified a tacit acceptance of President Donald Trump’s recently unveiled peace plan.

“This week Secretary Pompeo will be in Saudi Arabia. You can read the public statements of Saudi officials regarding the peace plan and other public statements they’ve made. So we are hopeful things will continue to change in a direction that we will be pleased with,” said Hoenlein.

Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan on Thursday stressed the kingdom still has no formal relations with Israel.

“Saudi Arabia’s policy has been very clear since the beginning of this conflict. There are no relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel, and the Kingdom stands firmly behind Palestine,” bin Farhan told Saudi TV channel Al Arabiya, adding: “There is no meeting planned between Saudi Arabia and Israel.”",https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/02/17/u-s-jewish-leaders-visit-saudi-arabia-in-groundbreaking-step-for-israel-ties/
326,Good News for Netanyahu as Israel's Economy Beats Expectations,['Breitbart Jerusalem'],"TEL AVIV – Israel’s economic growth last year exceeded all predictions, boding well for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who hopes his stewardship of the Jewish state’s strong finances will give him the upper hand against main political challenger Blue and White’s Benny Gantz, Bloomberg News reported.

According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, the GDP rose a seasonally adjusted, annualized 4.8 percent last quarter, which is the fastest quarterly rate in two years. At 3.5 percent expansion, 2019 topped 2018 and defied all predictions that growth would plateau as a result of deadlock elections.

Bank of Israel researchers had predicted 2019 and 2020 growth would only approach three percent, the result of a decrease in world trade and the interim government’s failure to pass a 2020 budget.

Public spending, which took the biggest hit, would likely rise again once the budget is in place, Leader Capital Markets Ltd. economist Jonathan Katz said.

Fourth-quarter growth last year saw a 10 percent rise in private consumption and an 8.7 percent jump in investment, the report said, but noted that some of these numbers were affected by quarterly car imports.

Netanyahu is prioritizing his leadership of Israel’s strong economy in next month’s election, the report said, in the hope it will give him a definitive edge over Gantz.

“Underlying growth in Israel has been relatively stable this year and surprises to quarterly GDP data have largely been driven either by sharp changes in inventories or fluctuations in car purchases,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists said before the data release.

But even without import taxes, growth was 3.3 percent in the quarter, “a strong number,” according to Katz.

“The data could push central bankers to continue favoring foreign-currency purchases over potential interest-rate cuts as a means of easing policy since growth is purring along,” he said.",https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/02/17/report-good-news-for-netanyahu-as-israels-economy-surpasses-expectations/
327,Jews and Chinese Officials Gather at Western Wall to Pray for End to Coronavirus,['Deborah Danan'],"TEL AVIV – Hundreds of worshipers gathered at the Western Wall in Jerusalem on Sunday to pray for the recovery of people afflicted by coronavirus and to ask God to stop the outbreak of the disease.

The event was led by Chief Rabbi of Safed and president of the Rabbinical Community Association, Rabbi Shmuel Eliyahu, in partnership with the Israeli branch of the Orthodox Union, the U.S.’ largest Orthodox Jewish organization.

Worshipers recited prayers and read Psalms, sang songs and danced around an installation in a spiritual drive to hamper the outbreak of the virus that is gripping the world. The installation in the men’s section of the Jewish holy site was inscribed with the words: “The People of Israel pray for the sake of China” in Hebrew and Chinese.

“Millions and millions of people are going through tremendous suffering in China and outside China,” Rabbi Avi Berman, executive director of the Israeli branch of the Orthodox Union, told the Jerusalem Post.

“As Jews, we believe that God has the power to send healing. We are not doctors, but we can pray.”

Several Chinese officials in Israel also attended the ceremony.

“The Chinese Embassy in Israel would like to extend its sincere appreciation for the sympathy, support and solidarity expressed by the Jewish people. We will never forget it,” the embassy said.

Berman also noted the secondary challenges China is facing as a result of the virus, including the country’s economic standstill, and the decision by major airlines to cancel flights.

He lauded the Chinese government for the extraordinary lengths it is taking to prevent the further spread of the virus.

“We look at our forefathers and see how when they saw trouble in the world, they prayed to God to take care of it, they prayed for the sick to recover and for the poor to find sustenance. The Chinese people represent one sixth of the world and many are affected also in the United States, in Europe, in Asia,” Berman said.

“We should all worry about what is happening and come together to do something about it. I can tell you that since the end of Shabbat my phone has not stopped for a moment to ring or receive messages from schools, communities or organization wishing to participate or to show their support,” he added.

“Every single person in the world has the ability to pray in their own words. King David, who went through very hard times, composed beautiful prayers that we can use,” Berman said.

Vera Schwarcz, a Professor of Chinese history at Connecticut’s Wesleyan University, attended the event.

“I am delighted that so many people came in spite of the weather. I believe in the power of tefillot [prayers],” she said. “I also believe that this is a place of emet, of truth, while the Chinese government has been spreading a lot of misinformation. I think this gathering is also a way to uncover and elevate the truth.”

A long shofar blast marked the conclusion of the event.

“In time of need we all come together and with the help of God we hope that the coronavirus will soon be cured. However, it is important to also remember to come together in normal times and not to lose sight of all the good that exists in the world,” Berman said.",https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/02/17/jews-and-chinese-officials-gather-at-western-wall-to-pray-for-end-to-coronavirus/
328,Ivanka Trump Dons Hijab for Mosque Visit; Eschews Elsewhere in UAE,['Joel B. Pollak'],"White House adviser Ivanka Trump donned a hijab — a traditional head covering to show modesty — during a visit to the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on Saturday.

In the past, both Ivanka Trump and First Lady Melania Trump had declined to cover their heads while visiting Muslim countries — as in President Donald Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia in May 2017.

And for much of her visit this weekend to the United Arab Emirates, where she was the keynote speaker at the Global Women’s Forum, Ivanka Trump did not cover her head.

But in a visit to a mosque, a holy site, diplomatic protocol typically requires adherence to custom and decorum — as is the case for the holy sites of other faiths, such as the Western Wall in Jerusalem, where men of all faiths are expected to wear kippot or yarmulkes in accordance with Jewish tradition. At the Vatican, both Melania and Ivanka Trump covered their heads when meeting with Pope Francis.

In the Jewish faith, which Ivanka Trump shares, many married religious women also cover their heads out of modesty, especially in religious settings, though there is no Jewish equivalent of the Islamic veil.

In that context, Ivanka Trump’s visit to the mosque was also significant, as she is among the first Jewish people to be an honored guest of a kingdom that has been, until recently, cold toward Israel and Jews.

The United Arab Emirates has, until recently, barred Israelis from entering the country, in a policy that has been described as antisemitic. However, relations are warming and those restrictions are being eased.

Ivanka Trump praised the United Arab Emirates for recent reforms that granted more freedom to women in the country, the AP reported.

329,Swiss Islamic State Cell Plotted Major Terror Attack,['Chris Tomlinson'],"According to a new investigation by Swiss media, a cell of jihadists based in Geneva plotted to bomb cisterns full of oil near the city’s airport in a major terror attack.

The plot, which was set to take place last year before being stopped, revolved largely around a man named Daniel D., who also went by the Islamic name Abu Ilias al-Swisri, a convert to Islam who went on to join the Islamic State terror group two years later, Le Temps reports.

Al-Swisri, now 25-years-old, had attended the Petit-Saconnex mosque where he met two other radicals named “PF” and Ramzi, who would also join his Islamic State terror cell.

In 2015, both al-Swisri and Ramzi took a trip to Syria where they met with a branch of Islamic State and received weapons training. PF, who remained in Geneva, requested to join the two men in Syria but was told by al-Swisri that the group wanted to plot an attack in Switzerland.

Al-Swisri is said to have formed relationships with several more Switzerland-based jihadists, all of whom are currently, like al-Swisri, detained in Kurdish prison camps, and plotted the bombing attack with them.

11 Suspected Jihadists Arrested in Swiss Raids, Including Several Minors https://t.co/3p1NBd2F5n — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 30, 2019

In 2018, American intelligence sent a warning to Swiss intelligence regarding the terror plot which was said to have been planned for April or May of 2019. The arrest fo two Albanian migrants heading for Geneva is also rumoured to have been a factor in the unravelling of the plot.

Details, however, have remained sketchy due to investigators not wanting to jeopardise the case, with key details being kept hidden until they were revealed this week by Le Temps.

The terror cell is not the first in Switzerland. In 2015 it was revealed that a terror cell was operating out of the An’Nur mosque in the city of Winterthur near Zurich by journalist Kurt Pelda.

As recently as October of last year, eleven suspected jihadists were arrested by Swiss authorities, including five minors.

330,Iraqi Women Take to Streets of Baghdad Against Powerful Shiite Cleric,['John Hayward'],"A group of Iraqi women joined ongoing anti-government protests in Baghdad’s Tahrir Square on Thursday — a daring exercise given both cultural stigmas against women participating in politics and the proclivity of Iran-backed Shiite militia thugs and Iraqi government security forces for murdering demonstrators.

The women were particularly angry at influential Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr for attempting to impose a set of theocratic rules on the protests, one of which would forbid female demonstrators to mix with men.

Sadr, who vacillates between supporting and opposing the protest movement, decided he was a “reformer” again last week and published a “Reform Revolution Charter” laying out 18 rules for demonstrators to obey.

Most of the rules called on protesters to refrain from blocking roads, forcing businesses to close, or taking other actions that interfere with daily life, but one of them commanded: “Religious, social principles of the country should be taken consideration as much as possible, and for no mixing between the two sexes in protester tents to take place.”

“Women’s play a big role in Tahrir. Because of what was said, that it is prohibited for women to go to Tahrir, we organized a march to come and support our brothers and youth here,” one of the women marching in the square told the Kurdish Rudaw news service on Thursday, responding directly to Sadr’s edict.

“This is wrong. There is already mixing in universities between males and females. Even primary schools are mixed. This is very normal,” another woman said

“Women actually have the right to come out and protest the same as men. They are our sisters,” a male demonstrator chimed in.

Sadr, in turn, blasted the female demonstrators on Twitter, calling them “sinful, immoral, licentious, and against Iraqi values.” He bizarrely compared the women to ISIS and the Taliban for good measure, as if they were the religious extremists in the debate.

“We today are committed to prevent Iraq from becoming like Kandahar for religious extremism, and neither Chicago for liberation, moral decadence, homosexuality for the licentious and immoral,” Sadr thundered.

“I advise these aberrant bunches of the Daesh of civility and liberation not to follow their animal instincts and fleeting lusts. We won’t stand by and watch while religious belief and homeland are abused,” he continued. “Daesh” is another name for ISIS.

This line of criticism is unlikely to win Sadr many friends outside his dedicated base of followers since women were victimized by ISIS with savage glee, a fact many of the female demonstrators took pains to point out.

Women’s march organizer Ban Aaraji said her goal was to emphasize that women have always been part of the protest movement, including using their bodies to shield young men when the protesters have been physically attacked. Many of Thursday’s demonstrators were female students chanting slogans against discrimination and demanding equal rights.

Al-Jazeera took stock of Sadr’s position last week and speculated his political opportunism and volatile temper are finally catching up with him. His secular former allies in the protest movement are unlikely to be charmed by Sadr presuming he has the authority to draw up a list of religious commandments for the protest movement, and the Iraqi people are clearly hungry for much more than the “reform agenda” of minor tweaks to the system Sadr supported during those periods when he decided to be a gadfly instead of an establishment player.

According to Al-Jazeera’s scorecard, Sadr made a show of “protecting” protesters against militia goons and government troops last fall, but he was actually trying to take over the protest movement. His gambit failed as the committed Iraqi protest movement made a point of distinguishing itself from the cleric’s “Sadrist” foot soldiers and kept demanding regime change long after Sadr made it clear he would never go that far.

Sadr is not even in Iraq at the moment — he is living in the Iranian holy city of Qom and studying Shiite religious law in a bid to become a full ayatollah. The Iraqi protest movement rejects Sadr as a stooge for Tehran, whose influence over Iraqi politics they wish to reduce, and the Iranians have convinced him his life will be in danger if he returns to Iraq. He is primarily communicating with his deputies in Iraq via social media.

“This may be the first time that al-Sadr has had a head-on collision with his support base. His most ardent followers will stick by him, but it is clear he is losing his clout in the streets. As a result, his position may be weaker in the next election,” Al-Jazeera concluded.",https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/02/14/iraqi-women-baghdad-against-powerful-shiite-cleric/
331,Hezbollah Leader Wishes He Would Have Died Instead of Soleimani,['Frances Martel'],"Hassan Nasrallah, the head of the Iran-backed Shiite terrorist organization Hezbollah, lamented on Iranian television on Thursday that he could not trade his life for that of Major General Qasem Soleimani, eliminated in a U.S. airstrike in January.

Soleimani was considered Iran’s most prominent and dangerous terrorist leader at the time of his death. President Donald Trump ordered an airstrike on his convoy in Baghdad, where he was believed to be organizing imminent attacks on U.S. forces. The weekend before his death, a mob of pro-Iranian militants attempted a failed storming of the U.S. embassy in Baghdad and named Soleimani as their leader.

As head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, Soleimani was believed to be the leader managing Iran’s international terrorism strategy, leaving a significant gap in Iran’s foreign terrorism policy. American analysts have credited him with spearheading efforts to use roadside bombs in Iraq to kill and dismember American soldiers; he and forces he commanded are believed to be responsible for hundreds of American deaths.

On Thursday night, in an interview that was part of a larger coverage of the 40th day since Soleimani’s death, Nasrallah dramatically offered his soul to the grim reaper in a hypothetical conversation with the spiritual force.

According to Iran’s Mehr News Agency, Nasrallah appeared on the verge of tears discussing Soleimani, calling him the “master of Axis of Resistance’s martyrs.” The “axis of resistance” is the global coalition of nations against the United States and the human rights ideals typical in the West.

Nasrallah said in the interview that he had imagined the possibility of trading his life to God for Soleimani’s.

“In light of this hypothetical, I thought: What would I say to the angel of death? I would say, without a doubt, take me and leave Hajj Qasem Soleimani,” he declared. “Hajj” is an honorific indicating that Soleimani had completed his mandatory pilgrimage to Mecca.

“Haj Qasem was not merely a military commander, he possessed a great multi-aspect character,” Mehr quotes Nasrallah as saying. “He was tireless; he worked round the clock without any hesitation. … When we talk about Hajj Qasem’s legacy, it means taking risks and moving toward the danger in battlefields.”

Nasrallah’s Hezbollah group, based officially in Lebanon, is facing significant challenges during the Trump era. U.S. State Department reports have confirmed that Hezbollah has run into so much trouble fundraising that it has resorted to placing piggy banks at supermarkets in neighborhoods friendly to the terrorist group to keep its activities afloat. Experts believe that much of Hezbollah’s funding comes from Iran and illicit trade with Venezuela, both of whom have suffered under crippling American sanctions intended to limit their ability to commit human rights abuses.

Hezbollah in Lebanon, a formal political party, is also reportedly losing influence, in part due to months of protests against established political actors. The protests formed the creation of a new government, but many in the protest movement have expressed little hope that the new formation will bring about legitimate change to the country.

“We don’t trust Hezbollah, as it’s a partner of the current political game,” Raneem al-Ahmar, a Lebanese political activist, told Israel’s Ynet news. “They manipulated us.”

Soleimani often worked closely with Hezbollah agents throughout Iran’s spheres of influence, which span from Palestine to Yemen.

Mehr repeated the Iranian regime’s talking points that Soleimani spent time in Syria and Iraq to fight the Islamic State for the greater good of humanity. In reality, Soleimani was dispatched to Syria at the height of the civil war there to help dictator Bashar al-Assad stay in power. Soleimani reportedly helped Assad attack civilian rebel strongholds, killing hundreds and dislodging millions from their home; he also organized supply distribution from Iran to Assad regime forces.

Iranian state media claimed on Thursday that “thousands” had gathered in Tehran to commemorate Soleimani’s death 40 days prior, noting that many were members of the IRGC, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. Soleimani’s replacement at the helm of the Quds Force, Esmail Qaani, delivered remarks vowing revenge for Soleimani and warning the Quds Force to remain alert against the United States and Israel.

“The top Iranian general also warned various political factions and figures to remain united in order to ward off enemies’ plots, noting that in case of division in the ranks of the nation and political officials, the country and the Islamic establishment as a whole would be damaged irreparably,” the Iranian state outlet PressTV reported.

The outlet also commemorated Soleimani’s death by republishing propaganda pieces written in the wake of his death, heralding him as a “peace champion” and proclaiming his death an “act of war, the highest of high crimes.”

The event honoring Soleimani, as translated by The National, an Emirati newspaper, also included remarks from the head of the IRGC, Gen. Hossein Salami, once again threatening the United States.

“If you make the slightest error, we will hit both of you,” he said, presumably including Israel alongside Washington.

332,U.S. Navy Seizes Cache of Iranian Weapons Bound for Yemen,['John Hayward'],"The USS Normandy, a Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser, intercepted a small sailing vessel in the Arabian Sea over the weekend and found it loaded with Iranian weapons bound for the Houthi rebels in Yemen.

The weapons included 150 anti-tank missiles and three surface-to-air missiles, plus a supply of components useful for maintaining unmanned aerial vehicles.

U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a statement on Thursday:

Many of these weapons systems are identical to the advanced weapons and weapon components seized by guided-missile destroyer USS Forrest Sherman (DDG 98) in the Arabian Sea on Nov. 25, 2019. Those weapons were determined to be of Iranian origin and assessed to be destined for the Houthis in Yemen, which would be in violation of a UN Security Council Resolution that prohibits the direct or indirect supply, sale, or transfer of weapons to the Houthis.

The USS Forrest Sherman incident was very similar, involving the seizure of a small boat in the Arabian Sea that proved to be ferrying a cache of Iranian weapons to Yemen. U.S. officials said at the time that the cache of missiles seized in November were more sophisticated than Iranian arms previously smuggled to Yemen.

“The action by the Normandy in seizing the arms cache was the first publicly announced haul haul for the U.S. Navy since a Jan. 4 drone strike at Baghdad’s International Airport that killed Iranian Quds Force leader Qasem Soleimani,” Military.com observed.

An “inter-agency and international effort” is underway to assess the weapons, Fox News reported, with U.S. partner nations and international organizations invited to inspect the cache.

“Everything points to these weapons being made in Iran. They’re all very consistent with what we know about weapons that have been made in Iran,” CENTCOM spokesman Cmdr. Zachary Harrell told Voice of America News (VOA) on Thursday.

Harrell noted that shipping such weapons to Yemen, where a bloody civil war has produced one of the world’s worst humanitarian catastrophes, “would be in violation of a U.N. Security Council Resolution that prohibits the direct or indirect supply, sale or transfer of weapons to the Houthis.”

Officials told VOA they could find no evidence linking the crew of the intercepted ship to militant groups. The crew members all had papers identifying themselves as Yemeni fishermen. They were released by the USS Normandy after the illicit weapons were secured.",https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/02/14/u-s-navy-seizes-cache-iranian-weapons-bound-yemen/
333,Blue State Blues: Iran War Powers Resolution a Futile Exercise in Appeasement,['Joel B. Pollak'],"The Senate passed its version of the Iran War Powers resolution on Thursday, a bill that Democrats hastily introduced last month after President Donald Trump’s successful airstrike to eliminate Iranian terrorist General Qasem Soleimani.

Trump’s action was not only constitutional, given his role as commander-in-chief, but was also authorized by prior resolutions on Iraq, which is where Soleimani was when we got him.

Moreover, Trump’s airstrike — which involved no civilian casualties at all — was effective.

Taking out Soleimani meant getting rid of the man who has pursued Iran’s regional terror wars — partly funded by President Barack Obama’s nuclear deal. It also deterred further attacks on our embassy in Baghdad, which an Iranian-backed militia stormed late last year.

In retaliation, Iran fired several missiles at U.S. bases in Iraq, causing some injuries but killing no one. It was a win for the U.S. — as even his critics acknowledged.

Trump’s Iran policy is succeeding precisely because he is willing to use military force.

And that is what Democrats refuse to understand: by showing our enemies that we are prepared to use force, we deter them from taking actions that would require us to use far greater force — at greater risk.

Showing that we are willing to use force also makes our diplomacy more effective. The main reason Obama’s Iran deal was so weak was no one really believed him when he said that the military option was on the table.

The case for the Iran War Powers Resolution is that Trump somehow cannot be trusted to command the armed forces in war. But he has repeatedly shown otherwise — and that is a matter for voters to decide, anyway.

The Senate version of the resolution was introduced by none other than Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), who was Hillary Clinton’s running mate in the 2016 election. If Americans wanted Tim Kaine to direct our foreign policy, we would have elected him.

The few Republicans who have lent their support to this ignominious effort can pretend they were defending congressional prerogatives over war under the Constitution, but those were never at risk.

And Democrats never cared about those powers, anyway. When President Barack Obama went to war in Libya, defying the War Powers Resolution and refusing to seek authorization from Congress, Democrats had no problem with it.

Then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) actually defended him. Asked whether she believed Obama “did not need authorization, initially, and still does not need any authorization from Congress to go in Libya,” Pelosi said, “Yes.”

The Iran War Powers Resolution is purely a political exercise, drafted by Democrats to show defiance to the president in an election year. And the Republicans who voted for it have simply helped Democrats sharpen their message.

Instead of supporting the president as he confronts one of our most dangerous enemies, and as he stands with the Iranian people against their tyrannical government, Congress decided to signal that it does not support the president’s successful approach.

The Iranians will notice, of course, and may believe that it is safe for them to attack Americans again, as well as the protesters in the streets.

Ironically, by purporting to restrain the president from military action against Iran, Congress may therefore have increased the risk of war.

There is no doubt that Trump will veto the resolution. Perhaps that is why some Republicans joined Democrats in voting for it: they believed it was a freebie. They could show that they had opposed the president, without actually changing the president’s successful policy.

But appearances, as we were constantly reminded by Democrats during the impeachment trial, are crucial. And if it was a serious threat to our national security for the White House to withhold aid to Ukraine — temporarily, and out of public view — because of the signal that might send to Russia, it is a far greater blow for Congress to oppose a successful policy against Iran, in public.

President Trump should not just veto the Iran War Powers resolution. He should veto it with 55 pens, and send one to each of the Senators who voted for it, to remind them of what they tried to do at a moment when our president, and the Iranian people, needed solidarity.

334,Rabbi Shmuley: AIPAC Should Repair Its Relationship with President Trump,['Shmuley Boteach'],"If AIPAC can apologize to the Democratic party for a mistake they made on Facebook, they can apologize to President Donald Trump for a mistake they made before 20,000 of their members.

AIPAC — the American Israel Public Affairs Committee — is the most important organization representing pro-Israel Americans who believe that a strong U.S.-Israel relationship is in our national interest.

One of AIPAC’s strengths has always been a bipartisan approach to lobbying, and a recognition that both Democratic and Republican support is essential for the U.S.-Israel alliance alliance to endure.

In a rare misstep, AIPAC recently placed Facebook ads that blamed “radicals in the Democratic Party” for “pushing their antisemitic policies down the throats of the American people,” and asking supporters to sign a letter telling Democrats not to “abandon Israel.” One version of the petition said “It’s critical that we protect our Israeli allies especially as they face threats from Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, ISIS and – maybe more sinister – right here in Congress.”

The ad was surprising, because AIPAC’s philosophy has always been that elected officials are potential friends rather than enemies. The language was also surprisingly strident for an organization that prides itself on its political acumen.

Substantively, the ads were on point, in identifying the growing danger of radicals taking over the Democratic Party and turning the United States against Israel. Three congresswomen who apparently were in a graphic attached to the ad are among those seeking to undermine the relationship.

Reps. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota are antisemites who promote the “boycott, divest, sanctions” (BDS) movement that seeks Israel’s destruction. The third woman, Rep. Betty McCollum of Minnesota, has spread lies about Israel’s treatment of Palestinian minors and introduced legislation seeking to cut aid to Israel based on the information she is disseminating from Palestinian propaganda groups.

The AIPAC ads targeted “radicals,” but they could also have applied to several of the Democratic candidates for president who want to return to the catastrophic nuclear deal with Iran, condition vital military aid to Israel, and return to the failed “peace” initiatives of the past.

Predictably, Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of the radical left-wing J Street organization, accused AIPAC of attacking “progressive voices who are seeking peace, justice and right for both Israelis and Palestinians” and suggested the lobby is too supportive of the U.S. president and Israeli prime minister.

His response highlights the difference between the two organizations. Unlike J Street, AIPAC understands that to be effective you have to work with the leaders in power. Unlike J Street, AIPAC represents the views of most pro-Israel Americans. Unlike J Street, AIPAC believes in bipartisanship rather than being cheerleaders for Democrats critical of Israel. Unlike J Street, AIPAC respects Israel’s democracy and believes the people of Israel should determine their fate rather than kibitzers 6,000 miles away who want to substitute their judgement for the people who must live with the consequences. Unlike J Street, AIPAC does not believe the Palestinians are blameless for the ongoing conflict, nor does it advocate one-sided pressure on Israel to capitulate to Palestinian demands.

Those differences explain why AIPAC is considered the most powerful foreign policy lobby in Washington and J Street’s influence is non-existent.

The speciousness of the J Street accusations are also apparent from AIPAC’s hypersensitivity to upsetting Democrats. After the ads were criticized, AIPAC issued a rare statement apologizing for offending Democrats with the ad’s “imprecise wording.”

To its credit, AIPAC did not totally surrender to its critics, saying that the ad “alluded to a genuine concern of many pro-Israel Democrats about a small but growing group, in and out of Congress, that is deliberately working to erode the bipartisan consensus on this issue and undermine the U.S.-Israel relationship.”

I am an AIPAC supporter and have attended its annual policy conference for nearly three decades. But AIPAC has someone else to whom it should apologize: President Donald Trump.

In 2016, then-candidate Donald Trump spoke to the AIPAC policy conference and received enthusiastic applause when he said President Barack Obama was “maybe the worst thing to happen to Israel” and added, “Yay,” after mentioning the president was in his final year. The applause was not meant to insult the president but expressed two years of pent-up frustration at his push for the Iran deal, which legitimized Iran’s genocidal threats against Israel and gave the terrorist regime $150 billion to murder innocents across the globe.

The next day, then AIPAC president Lillian Pinkus tearfully apologized. “We say, unequivocally, that we do not countenance ad hominem attacks, and we take great offense to those that are levied against the president of the United States of America from our stage.” She added, “While we may have policy differences, we deeply respect the office of president of the United States and our president, Barack Obama. There were people in our AIPAC family who were deeply hurt last night, and for that we are deeply sorry. We are disappointed that so many people applauded the sentiment that we neither agree with or condone.”

There was one major problem with the apology: It did not anticipate that Donald Trump would be president seven months later.

The Washington Post noted the apology was “unprecedented.” Trump was not the first speaker to criticize a sitting president. In fact, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), speaking after Trump, compared Obama’s catastrophic nuclear deal with Iran to Neville Chamberlain’s appeasement of Hitler at Munich in 1939.

Pinkus may have disagreed with Trump’s sentiments, and AIPAC was probably pressured by the White House and Democrats to defend the president. But what Trump said should not have been a surprise. Moreover, the crowd’s response indicated his views were popular with many who viewed Obama’s presidency as problematic for Israel.

Now, almost four years later, Donald Trump has proven to be the most pro-Israel president in history and a dramatic contrast to his predecessor. After AIPAC’s public criticism of his words, it is perhaps not surprising that he is the first president in years to refuse to appear at the conference. Even this year, a presidential election year, he is not slated to appear at the AIPAC Conference in March.

The pro-Israel community deserves to hear from the president, and it’s my hope that AIPAC can repair relations with the president by doing for him what they did for Democrats last week.

AIPAC is America’s most important Jewish organization. It’s time they repair their relationship with a President who has had Israel’s back since the day he took office.

335,Assad Regime Recognizes the Armenian Genocide in Bid to Spite Turkey,['Ben Kew'],"Backers of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria passed a motion on Thursday recognizing the Armenian genocide, a move inspired by growing hostility between Assad and Turkey.

The move comes amid escalating violence between Turkish and Syrian forces in and around the city of Idlib and just one day after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced that his forces would strike the Syrian government forces after they killed 13 Turkish soldiers in the past week.

“If there is the slightest damage to our soldiers on the observation posts or other places, I am announcing from here that we will hit the regime forces everywhere from today, regardless of Idlib’s borders or the lines of the Sochi agreement,” Erdogan said on Thursday.

The Syrian parliament, which is composed solely of backers of Assad’s socialist regime, responded by describing Turkey’s actions as the “toughest in the history of humankind.”

“The parliament … condemns and recognizes the genocide committed against the Armenians by the Ottoman state at the start of the twentieth century,” their statement read. Russia, which remains the Syrian regime’s most important backer, has accused Turkey of violating the agreements it made in 2018 with Moscow on the de-escalation of violence in Idlib.

“We are currently living through a Turkish aggression that relies on the same hateful Ottoman thinking [as] the crimes carried out by Erdogan’s forefathers against the Armenian people,” Parliament Speaker Hammouda Sabbagh said.

The Armenian genocide, which took place between 1915 and 1923, was the systematic murder of the 1.6 million Armenian people, most of them Christians, at the hands of the Ottoman Empire. Many countries around the world have already recognized the genocide, although the United States has still failed to do so.

Turkey vehemently denies the description of events as genocide, instead describing it as a “tragedy” where both sides suffered serious losses. Countries that choose to recognize the events are consequently seen as hostile forces.

Last December, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a motion branding the killings as genocide. The Trump administration dismissed such recognition to continue currying favor with Turkey, which has traditionally been an ally of Washington.

“The position of the Administration has not changed,” State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a terse two-sentence statement at the time. “Our views are reflected in the president’s definitive statement on this issue from last April.”

336,Ze’ev Zion: AIPAC Panders to the Democrats — Again,"[""Ze'Ev Zion""]","Once upon a time, AIPAC — the American Israel Public Affairs Committee — was one of the most successful lobbyist groups in the United States. AIPAC’s achievement was creating the impression that if you wanted to attain political power at the national level, you had to at least be perceived as being supportive of Israel.

Then Barack Obama became President and broke AIPAC. The influential pro-Israel organization was completely unprepared for a presidential candidate, and then President, like Obama.

AIPAC’s business model is forming relationships with elected representatives–mostly freshman members of Congress, but also Governors and other state leaders– to educate them about Israel. From there, AIPAC assumes that anyone who climbs the ranks and eventually becomes a serious nominee for president will be someone who AIPAC has developed a close relationship with, and who is therefore likely pro-Israel.

And for a time, this worked. Starting in the 1990s, and peaking during the George W. Bush administration, both parties could be considered generally supportive of Israel.

AIPAC has a strict policy of not creating any enemies. Their motto is, “We have friends, and potential friends.” AIPAC does not endorse candidates because they fear that if their candidate loses, the winner will hold a grudge.

AIPAC makes a fetish out of bipartisanship. They refuse to support any legislation– no matter how pro-Israel– if it doesn’t have sufficient bipartisan support. It is for this reason that AIPAC watered down the Taylor Force Act, which defunded Palestinian terror, in order to rally more Democrat support, before endorsing the final legislation — even though a stronger version of the bill could have probably passed with mostly Republican support.

When Obama became a serious contender for president, alarm bells should have gone off. AIPAC should have realized an Obama presidency would be terrible for the U.S.-Israel relationship. Obama was close with a number of radical anti-Israel individuals, including Pastor Jeremiah Wright; the terrorist Bill Ayers; and professor Rashid Khalidi. As a responsible lobbying group, AIPAC should have done everything they could to prevent Obama from winning. But that is not how AIPAC operates.

Instead, AIPAC decided to ignore Obama’s problematic background. Worse, AIPAC actively promoted Obama — who was close with then-AIPAC President, Lee Rosenberg. At the 2008 AIPAC policy conference, Rosenberg gave a lavishly positive introduction for Obama, who gave a rousing pro-Israel speech to numerous standing ovations.

Much of AIPAC was seduced by Obama’s lofty rhetoric and charm, and they gave him the kosher stamp of approval. They should have known better. Everyone who attends AIPAC events talks a great game about their supposed pro-Israel credentials. But those are just words.

When Obama became president, the fears of sober-minded pro-Israel individuals became realized. President Obama treated Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu worse than almost any world leader. He blamed the lack of peace in the region on Jewish communities — “settlements” — in Israel’s heartland.

At the end of his second term, President Obama violated decades of American policy and allowed an anti-Israel resolution to pass the United Nations Security Council condemning Israel for supposedly violating international law by governing Jerusalem — including the Jewish Quarter of the Old City. Worst of all, with Obama’s Iran deal, he empowered the greatest sponsor of terrorism in the world, which also seeks Israel’s annihilation.

The latter was the greatest test for AIPAC. They knew how dangerous Obama’s Iran deal would be for Israel, as well as America. So they mobilized all their supposed allies in Congress to vote against the deal — and failed miserably. The overwhelming majority of Democrats voted in favor of the Iran nuclear deal.

Why? Because Obama threatened to ruin the political career of any Democrat who voted against him on the issue.

Meanwhile, AIPAC essentially said to Democrats, “Please vote against the deal because we’re your friends, and if you don’t, no big deal.” What a shock that AIPAC lost.

AIPAC’s impotence in the face of Obama’s anti-Israel policies paved the way for worse anti-Israel views and individuals — who once would have been considered beyond the pale — to rise up in the Democrat Party.

A few years ago, no one from either party could compete for president without at least pretending to be pro-Israel, as Obama did. Now, the major candidates from the Democrat Party, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT), have thrown their lot in with radical anti-Israel leftists. And thus won’t hurt their image in the Democrat Party.

All the energy and influence in the Democrat Party has shifted to the far left. The anti-Israel group J Street now wields more influence in the Democrat Party than AIPAC. At the last J Street conference, virtually all of the Democrat candidates for President spoke in person or by video. AIPAC will be lucky if half the Democratic candidates appear at their policy conference March.

The most popular, emerging leaders in the Party, Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Ilhan Omar (D-MN), are anti-Israel — especially the latter. The few pro-Israel Democrats refuse to stand up to these zealots for fear of antagonizing the leftwing base.

Amazingly, someone at AIPAC noticed the problem. AIPAC recently took out an ad on Facebook criticizing the growing antisemitic movement on the left wing of the Democrat Party. Finally, many of us thought, AIPAC is taking a stand!

However, AIPAC immediately canceled the ad, and apologized for offending the Democrats. How pathetic.

Moving forward, AIPAC needs to realize that the game has changed. President Trump is the greatest friend Israel has ever had in the White House. The Democrat Party no longer prioritizes support for Israel. They are much more focused on domestic issues of race, identity, abortion, and opposing Trump.

AIPAC needs to stop promoting the facade that support for Israel is bipartisan. It is a noble goal to try to convince Democrats to support Israel.

But if Democrats refuse to do so, AIPAC needs to be honest about it and reevaluate how they can continue to promote the U.S.-Israel relationship in such an environment.

337,Hungarian MEP: Rising Antisemitism Fueled by Illegal Immigration,['Thomas D. Williams'],"Hungarian European Parliamentarian Balázs Hidvéghi declared this week that “radical Muslim antisemitism” is on the rise in Europe thanks to massive illegal immigration.

Speaking in Strasbourg in a Parliamentary discussion on antisemitism, Mr. Hidvéghi insisted Europe must have “zero tolerance for antisemitism,” noting that this is the only suitable stance after the Second World War.

“There is full social and political consensus on this issue in Hungary,” said the MEP. “Members of the Jewish community live in safety, practice their religion and live their identities. Ensuring this is not only a constitutional obligation but also a moral obligation.”

Hidvéghi said the situation in Hungary stands in contrast to much of Western Europe, where waves of Muslim immigration have been accompanied by growing violence against Jews.

“We are proud to be flourishing in Hungary and today experiencing a renaissance of Jewish culture, with Jewish people and families feeling safe and caring for their heritage,” Hidvéghi said. “In contrast, violence and attacks against Jewish communities in Western Europe are on the rise.”

“While all such attacks must be firmly condemned and rejected, it must also be talked about that the emergence and spread of radical Muslim antisemitism in Europe contributes to the rise of anti-Semitic attacks,” he said.

“Attacks against Western European Jewry are therefore another reason for taking decisive action against illegal migration,” he concluded.

Mr. Hidvéghi’s remarks coincide with the analysis of David P. Goldman, who in a 2018 “Spengler” essay asserted Hungary stands out as uniquely safe for Jews, due in large part to its refusal to accept immigration quotas from the European Union.

While elsewhere in Europe Muslim migrants “are the sole source of violent attacks on Jews,” Hungary’s immigration policy makes it distinctly safe for Jews, he said.

“There are no risks to Jews because there are very few Muslim migrants,” Mr. Goldman stated bluntly.

“Hungary is the safest European country for Jews, with no antisemitic violence of any kind in recent years,” he said.

Jewish life isn’t just flourishing in Budapest, Goldman wrote, it’s “roaring,” and on any given Friday evening, Budapest’s synagogue hosts some two hundred people for dinner. About 100,000 Israelis have dual Hungarian citizenship and many Israelis own property in the country and vote in Hungarian elections.

Prime Minister Viktor Orbán looks to Israel as an example, Goldman asserted, since Hungary is a small nation at risk of “demographic extinction” during the next century, and Israel is a small nation that has maintained its identity despite enormous forces against it.

Israel, Goldman declares, “should be a beacon for nations that are struggling to maintain their identity and cohesion against a demographic ebb-tide and against the pressures of globalization.”

According to the National Bureau of Vigilance Against Antisemitism, more than half of the incidents of antisemitism in France, and nearly all the violent ones, are perpetrated by immigrants from Muslim countries or their descendants, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported last year.

338,U.S. Convoy Attacked by ‘Pro-Regime’ Mob in Syria,['John Hayward'],"A U.S. convoy was stopped at a “pro-Syrian regime forces” checkpoint near Qamishli in northeastern Syria on Wednesday and attacked by a mob. According to Syrian state media, one civilian was killed and another injured when the convoy defended itself.

“After Coalition troops issued a series of warnings and de-escalation attempts, the patrol came under small arms fire from unknown individuals. In self-defense, Coalition troops returned fire. The situation was de-escalated and is under investigation. The Coalition patrol returned to base,” said a U.S. military statement on Wednesday.

Syria’s state-run SANA news agency claimed the attack was carried out by hundreds of angry locals who blocked the convoy’s passage, threw stones, and tore the American flag off one of the vehicles. According to this report, the convoy called in reinforcements when the confrontation escalated and eventually used smoke bombs and live ammunition to disperse the mob.

The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said some of the “demonstrators” were actually armed members of a militia allied with the Syrian regime. According to the SOHT, the militia fighters fired their weapons during the confrontation. One Syrian activist reported on Wednesday that the “militants” who attacked the U.S. patrol have been detained by Syrian government intelligence agents.

The UK Guardian reported that a Russian military convoy appeared on the scene “in an apparent attempt to mediate the rare confrontation involving US and Syrian fighters.” The Russian Defense Ministry stated that Russian troops helped to “prevent further escalation of the conflict.”

Qamishli is largely controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-led military force allied with the U.S. against the Islamic State. Syrian and Russian forces are present in the area as well, and the Syrians are allied with several local militia groups. A reporter working in the region told Voice of America News (VOA) on Wednesday that the convoy was attacked by members of a pro-regime militia called the National Defense Forces.

An SDF official told VOA that Kurdish forces normally accompany U.S. patrols, but on this occasion “no SDF fighters were involved.”",https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/02/13/u-s-convoy-attacked-pro-regime-mob-syria/
339,"J Street Leader Jeremy Ben-Ami Kisses, Embraces Palestinian Tyrant Mahmoud Abbas",['Joel B. Pollak'],"Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of the radical left-wing group J Street, embraced Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in New York on Tuesday and appeared to kiss him.

J Street styles itself as “pro-Israel, pro-peace,” but it frequently lobbies against Israel. It has opposed Israeli wars of self-defense against Hamas terrorists, for example, and opposes President Donald Trump’s new peace plan for the Middle East, even though it explicitly endorses the two-state solution, which J Street claims to support.

Abbas, elected in 2005, is now in the 16th year of what was supposed to be a four-year presidential term. He has rejected American and Israeli calls to stop paying stipends to Palestinian terrorists and their families — even though his intransigence has resulted in lowered tax transfers from Israel and the loss of U.S. aid.

The Palestinian president also has a long history of antisemitic rhetoric, including Holocaust denial. In 2018, even J Street felt compelled to condemn Abbas for making antisemitic remarks in a speech to Palestinian leaders (Abbas later apologized).

A few months later, the J Street leader traveled to Ramallah, where Abbas thanked him for J Street’s work in opposing the Trump administration’s policies and for supporting the “peace process.”

On Tuesday, Abbas denounced Trump’s peace plan — which acknowledges Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem, allows Israel to annex parts of Judea and Samaria necessary for its security, and makes Palestinian statehood conditional on a renunciation of terror — at the United Nations Security Council.

Ben-Ami greeted him warmly afterwards, following a press conference Abbas held with former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at a Manhattan hotel:

Media’s reaction when Abbas refused to take questions after opening statements. pic.twitter.com/FZVmhOoRfl — Jacob Kornbluh (@jacobkornbluh) February 11, 2020

Absolutely disgusting that @jstreetdotorg's @JeremyBenAmi would embrace Mahmoud Abbas. Abbas funds terrorists to kill American and Israeli Jews. He is a virulent anti-Semite.

340,Refugee Crisis Escalates as Turkey Faces Syrian Troops in Idlib,['John Hayward'],"The United Nations reported on Tuesday that a huge new wave of displaced civilians is pouring out of Syria’s Idlib province, driven out by intense Syrian and Russian military efforts to crush the last rebel forces and increasing tensions between Turkey and Syria.

According to the U.N., the refugee situation in Idlib is the worst it has been since the beginning of the Syrian civil war.

“In just 10 weeks, since 1 December, some 690,000 people have been displaced from their homes in Idlib and surrounding areas. This is, from our initial analysis, the largest number of people displaced in a single period since the Syrian crisis began almost 9 years ago,” spokesman David Swanson of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Tuesday.

Swanson pointed to freezing temperatures and snowfall in the region as reasons to fear a massive humanitarian crisis is brewing in Idlib.

“Existing camps and settlements of internally displaced persons are overcrowded, and shelter in existing houses is getting scarce. Many schools and mosques are filled with displaced families, and even finding a place in an unfinished building has become close to impossible,” he warned.

With the new refugee wave added to its grim tally, the Syrian conflict has displaced almost 12 million people, half of them fleeing Syria entirely, making it the worst refugee crisis in the world by a substantial margin.

The government of Turkey frequently complains about the large number of Syrian refugees headed their way, but Turkey is also contributing to the current crisis in Idlib by escalating hostilities with the Syrian military.

On Wednesday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened massive reprisals if Syrian forces injure or kill any more Turkish soldiers.

“In case our soldiers at observation points suffer in any way … I hereby declare we will strike back against regime forces everywhere. We will not forgive even the slightest violation,” Erdogan thundered at a meeting of the ruling AKP party in Ankara.

“The Assad regime was dealt a resounding blow, especially in Idlib, but that is not enough. There is more to come,” he vowed, referring to clashes between Syrian troops and Turkish-backed rebel forces. A Syrian military helicopter was shot down by the rebels near one of Turkey’s posts in Idlib on Tuesday. The Turkish military claimed it “neutralized” about a hundred Syrian regime soldiers in retaliation for Syrian shelling that has killed a dozen Turkish soldiers over the past week.

“If there is the smallest injury to our soldiers on the observation posts or other places, I am declaring from here that we will hit the regime forces everywhere from today, regardless of Idlib’s borders or the lines of the Sochi agreement,” Erdogan warned, referring to a ceasefire worked out in 2018 between Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Russian city of Sochi.

“We will do this by any means necessary, by air or ground, without hesitating, without allowing for any stalling,” he said.

Erdogan said his goal is to drive Syrian forces back from the dozen observation posts Turkey maintains in Idlib by the end of this month. The posts were established under the terms of the Sochi agreement with Syria’s patrons in Russia.

Addressing Syrian complaints about continued rebel attacks in the area, Erdogan claimed Turkey has “given the message that we will act without compromise to those from the opposition groups who act in an undisciplined way and give the regime an excuse to attack.”

Erdogan accused the regime in Damascus, along with its Russian and Iranian backers, of “continuously attacking civilians, committing massacres and shedding blood.”

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu backed Erdogan up by asking Russia, and Syria’s other principal patron Iran, to rein in Damascus before it launches further attacks on Idlib.

“Despite declaring a cease-fire, the regime again stepped up its aggression on January 12, especially with the air support provided by those who support the regime,” Cavusoglu said, alluding to Russian air support for Syrian troops and allied militia groups.

Turkey’s position enjoys support from the U.S. government, which denounced the intensity of the Syrian and Russian onslaught against Idlib despite the Sochi cease-fire framework.

“My condolences to the families of the soldiers killed in yesterday’s attack in Idlib. The ongoing assaults by the Assad regime and Russia must stop. I’ve sent Jim Jeffrey to Ankara to coordinate steps to respond to this destabilizing attack. We stand by our NATO ally Turkey,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday after five Turkish troops were killed by Syrian shelling on Monday.

“Today, the soldiers of our ally, Turkey, are under threat in Idlib. The threat comes from Russia and Assad’s government,” said Jim Jeffrey, the special envoy to Syria mentioned by Pompeo.

None of these remarks by Erdogan and the U.S. State Department were welcomed in Damascus or Moscow. The Syrian regime snarled that Erdogan’s “empty statements” were “disconnected from reality.”

The Kremlin accused Erdogan of flouting the agreement he made in Sochi to neutralize militants in Idlib and insisted Russia is holding up its end of the bargain.

“The Turkish side undertook to ensure that terrorist groups in Idlib were neutralized. We continue to note with regret that these groups are carrying out strikes from Idlib on Syrian forces and also taking aggressive action against our military facilities,” charged Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.

“This is unacceptable and runs contrary to the Sochi agreements,” Peskov added.",https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/02/12/refugee-crisis-escalates-turkey-faces-syrian-troops-idlib/
341,Fact Check: Abbas UN Speech Brimming with Anti-Israel Lies,['Deborah Danan'],"Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas once again had the opportunity to show off his polished skills in the art of double-speak in his address to the United Nations Wednesday. It was, to wit, classic Abbas: brimming with non-sequiturs, misinformation and outright lies.

The purpose of the speech was to categorically reject President Donald Trump’s recently unveiled peace plan and to garner support at the U.N. Security Council for a draft resolution opposing the proposal. A draft text originally put forward by Tunisia and Indonesia was reportedly backed by only five of the council’s 14 member states and was therefore pulled by the Palestinian leadership in an attempt to save face.

Nevertheless, Abbas delivered his speech as planned.

A recurring theme in the address was Abbas’ thinly-veiled attempt to rewrite history. The Palestinian leader is no newcomer to revisionism. He has a sordid history of Holocaust denial and his 1982 doctoral dissertation, among claims that the six million figure is invented, also asserted that Zionist leaders cooperated with the Nazis during the genocide of European Jews. He is famous for saying one thing to an international audience and quite another to his home base.

Abbas this week called on Palestinians to take to the streets and employ “popular resistance activities” over Trump’s “plot to liquidate the Palestinian cause,” the Palestinian Authority infamously pays out hundreds of millions of dollars per year to terrorists and their families, yet Abbas continues to repeat the claim – made again on Wednesday – that his leadership is only interested in peace.

During his speech, Abbas made the dramatically distorted claim that the Oslo peace accords failed because of the assassination of former prime minister Yitzhak Rabin.

“We have reached peace without the intervention of anyone, in Oslo. We were willing to commit to that agreement, until we reach a solution. However, they killed Rabin,” Abbas said.

Positing such a bombastic statement warps the timeline of events during the mid-1990s. The first Intifada culminated with the signing of the doomed accords in 1993 after which the Palestinians launched a terror rampage killing dozens of Israelis in suicide bus bombings and other attacks, beginning some two years before Rabin’s 1995 assassination.

Abbas also employed revisionist tactics in his oft-repeated references to a bygone Palestinian state. “Jerusalem is no longer under the sovereignty of the state of Palestine,” he lamented. Such language, of course, infers that there once was a state of Palestine.

“Jerusalem is occupied land. Who has the right to give this as a gift to one state or another? We came before you,” Abbas went on.

The last sentence is instantly debunked when you consider that Jews have had an unbroken presence in the Holy Land since biblical times.

Nevertheless, Abbas forges on, this time bringing in a little show-and-tell in the form of a series of maps showing the territory in 1917, 1937, 1947, 1967 and 2020. “Every time I look at this map, I lose hope. Is this what the Palestinian people deserve?” Abbas emoted. “Why? We were here,” he said, referencing the first map in which the majority of the territory is green – and by Abbas’ logic – Palestinian. “And how did we get to this point, in these small islands,” he continued, referencing the last map which shows the conceptual map for a future Palestinian state according to Trump’s plan, or, as Abbas would have it, “Swiss cheese.”

Yet there’s only one problem. The maps conveniently leave out any indication that pre-1948 Palestine was actually territory belonging to the Ottoman Empire and then the British Mandate, and not, as put forward by Abbas, a sovereign Arab state of Palestine that would later be stolen by Israel. Abbas has made similar claims before, even going as far as to claim in an op-ed published in the New York Times that in 1948 “Zionist forces expelled Palestinian Arabs to ensure a decisive Jewish majority in the future state of Israel, and Arab armies intervened.”

Arabs fled or were expelled after the nascent State of Israel’s army fought back the invasion of five Arab armies and Palestinian militias, not the other way around. Abbas also conveniently failed to mention, either in the NYT op-ed or in Wednesday’s speech, that the third map showing the 1947 partition plan was roundly shunned by the Palestinians – sparking a decades-long tradition of Palestinian rejectionism that continues until this day.",https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/02/12/abbas-at-un-how-do-i-lie-to-thee-let-me-count-the-ways/
342,UN Publishes ‘Antisemitic’ Blacklist’ of 112 Companies With Ties to Israeli Settlements,['Deborah Danan'],"TEL AVIV – The United Nations on Wednesday published its long-anticipated blacklist of more than 100 Israeli businesses that operate in West Bank settlements.

The UNCHR’s list was denounced as by Israeli leaders, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowing to “contest it with all of our strength” while President Reuven Rivlin said its publication brought to mind “dark periods in our history.”

The Palestinians hailed the move as a “victory for international law.”

Former U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley tweeted the UN “hit a new low today publishing its Antisemitic blacklist of companies it claims are involved in Israeli ‘settlement activity.’”

Multiple efforts were made by the U.S. to halt the list’s publication, which took four years to compile. It comes months after the U.S. announced that it no longer considers West Bank settlements to be illegal and weeks after President Donald Trump unveiled his peace plan which allows for Israeli sovereignty over those communities.

Of the 112 companies listed, 94 are Israeli businesses and 18 are international, including General Mills, producers of famous brands including Häagen-Dasz and Cheerios; Airbnb; TripAdvisor; Expedia; and communications giant Motorola. The Israeli companies listed include large corporations such as all the major banks, transportation firms Egged and Israel Railways Corporation, and all major telecommunications companies, as well as smaller businesses including popular restaurant chains.

The companies were not informed prior to the publication of the list.

“Those who boycott us will be boycotted themselves,” Netanyahu said in a statement.

“The UN Human Rights Council is a biased and uninfluential body. There is a reason why I already instructed to sever any connection with this body, and the US administration took that step with us. In recent years, we have promoted laws… stating that steps must be taken against anyone attempting to boycott Israel. Therefore, this body is insignificant. Instead of the organization dealing with human rights, it only attempts to discredit Israel. We reject any such attempt.”

Foreign Minister Israel Katz charged the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet of giving in to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel.

“The high commissioner’s decision to continue the UN Human Rights Council’s (UNHRC) anti-Israeli stance is a stain on her office,” Katz said.

He went on to note that the council constituted countries that are major human rights violators on the world stage.

“The State of Israel will not accept such discriminatory and anti-Israeli policies, and we will work in all ways to prevent such decisions from being implemented,” Katz said.

“I am proud to give these businesses a platform,” President Reuven Rivlin said after reading out a long list of Israeli companies mentioned on the list.

“I am proud that these are Israeli businesses, patriots who contribute to Israeli society, to economy and to peace. Although we do not promote private businesses here in this house, when Israeli businesses are under the threat of boycott, we will stand with them,” he said.

“Boycotting Israeli companies does not advance the cause of peace and does not build confidence between the sides. We call on our friends around the world to speak out against this shameful initiative which reminds us of dark periods in our history,” he said.",https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/02/12/un-blacklists-112-companies-with-ties-to-israeli-settlements/
343,Senior Who Has Trouble Walking Climbs Mt. Kilimanjaro: ‘It’s All Attitude’,['Amy Furr'],"A man who has difficulty walking recently hiked to the top of the highest mountain in Africa, Mount Kilimanjaro.

Joseph Grunfeld, 62, was born with a heart murmur, has undergone three back surgeries, and suffered a stroke that left one arm numb, according to the New York Post.

A violent mugging three years ago injured his knee, and he now has trouble walking normally following the surgery to repair it.

However, the New Yorker joined a group of 27 others with physical challenges to climb to the top of the dormant volcano, whose elevation is 19,341 feet.

“Every day, people with disabilities face many personal mountains to climb, some visible but many hidden,” said James Lassner, executive director of Friends of Access Israel (FAISR), the group that organized the climb.

Grunfeld, who also has Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), worked with a personal trainer to prepare him for the hike and lost 20 pounds in the process.

RA is an autoimmune disease that causes joint pain and inflammation when a person’s confused immune system attacks the lining of the joints, called the synovium, according to the Arthritis Foundation.

“That’s the tissue lining around a joint that produces a fluid to help the joint move smoothly. The inflamed synovium gets thicker and makes the joint area feel painful and tender, look red and swollen and moving the joint may be difficult,” the website read.

Despite battling altitude sickness, hallucinations, and severe breathing problems, Grunfeld, along with 25 of his fellow climbers, reached the summit.

The most common reason why most people give up before making it to the top is “attitude sickness,” according to ClimbMountKilimanjaro.com.

However, once Grunfeld started climbing, he never looked back.

“It was all a blur, but I did it. It’s all attitude. I was unbelievably inspired by the others with major injuries. These people are severely disabled, yet go out there and overcome great challenges,” he stated, adding, “I paid a lot of doctors to tell me no. I usually listen to them, but not this time.”

Now, Grunfeld is planning a hike up Machu Picchu with his wife, Gina, in the near future.

“I’m revved up,” he concluded.",https://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/02/17/senior-who-has-trouble-walking-climbs-mt-kilimanjaro-its-all-attitude/
344,Coronavirus Reaches Africa: First Patient Identified in Egypt,['Frances Martel'],"Egypt has confirmed the first case of novel Chinese coronavirus in Africa, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday, alarming experts who fear the continent’s healthcare systems are too fragile to combat another epidemic.

Africa is currently battling outbreaks of Ebola, measles, cholera, polio, and Lassa fever, among other diseases. Central Africa – particularly the Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Kenya, and Zimbabwe – are considered some of the most sensitive areas, as state infrastructure is weak, much of the population lives in poverty, and governments are already fighting other deadly diseases. Yet many of these nations have significant exposure to travel from China, where the virus originated, due to governments cutting deals with the Communist Party, making them likely stops for infected travelers.

The novel coronavirus began infecting people in Wuhan, a central Chinese city of 11 million people, in December. On January 1, Chinese authorities shut down a wild meat market in the city believed to have been where the virus jumped from animals to humans for the first time. Beijing took nearly a month after making that discovery to alert Wuhan residents to the presence of a contagious disease, resulting in local hospitals not isolating coronavirus carriers, thereby exposing sensitive patients to the disease. The city of Wuhan also allowed five million people to leave before instituting a lockdown, spreading the virus to every province in the country.

The Egyptian Health Ministry confirmed a coronavirus case on Friday, identifying the person only as a “foreigner,” according to the country’s al-Ahram newspaper. Health Ministry spokesman Khaled Megahed said the individual was not exhibiting any outward symptoms, adding to mounting evidence that the virus takes days or even weeks to manifest. Some doctors have suggested that coronavirus patients without outward symptoms may still be contagious, prompting the Egyptian government to place the individual in quarantine.

Megahed also noted that the patient traveled into Egypt recently and authorities caught his case by isolating and testing all individuals entering the country from nations that have documented cases of the virus. The Ministry did not state the identity of the patient, where he had traveled from, or if they are monitoring others who entered the country with him.

The World Health Organization (WHO), which Egypt has notified and engaged in coronavirus response, identified the patient as a man.

“The case was transferred as a foreign person to the hospital for isolation, follow-up and health check, as the case carries the virus and does not show any symptoms, and his condition is completely stable,” the WHO’s Egypt office posted on Twitter Sunday.

Egypt had already canceled departing and arriving flights from China on January 30 for at least the next month, the South China Morning Post noted and is currently handling cases of Egyptian nationals brought home from affected areas. Al-Ahram, citing the Egyptian Health Ministry, reported that the 302 Egyptians evacuated from Wuhan concluded their mandatory 14-day isolation on Monday, and all tested negative for the virus.

The WHO, at the Chinese Communist Party’s behest, is discouraging countries from stopping flights to and from China, as Beijing insists that doing so shows distrust of its authoritarian regime. Most nations have ignored this advice, leading to a two-thirds drop in the number of flights leaving China less than a month since it revealed the existence of the novel coronavirus.

Precautionary measures have limited most cases to Chinese borders. At press time, global health officials have identified 71,811 people as confirmed coronavirus cases, the overwhelming majority of them within China. Another 1,775 people have died of the virus, most in China, except isolated cases in the Philippines, Taiwan, France, Japan, and Hong Kong. The Diamond Princess, a cruise ship quarantined off the coast of Japan after a person on board tested positive for coronavirus, is now home to 369 cases out of 2,500 people on board – more than any other country, except China.

Outside of Egypt, no African country has documented cases. In the surrounding areas, Spain, Italy, and the United Arab Emirates have identified confirmed virus carriers.

WHO officials and others in the health industry have identified Africa as a particularly vulnerable continent for an outbreak, however, given its ties to China and its weak healthcare systems. Nations that have signed onto the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) – a worldwide plan in which China invests millions in building roads, ports, and railways through predatory loans, then seizes those projects from the countries they are built in – have taken in thousands of Chinese workers, many of whom flagrantly violate local immigration policies to stay and work illegally, particularly in Kenya. The programs, which have resulted in Chinese government officials instituting racist policies against Africans in their own countries, have triggered a widespread backlash against the Chinese government, which has led to some movements in Africa banning Chinese citizens until the coronavirus outbreak wanes.

The WHO said in a statement in early February that it is working to identify and aid vulnerable countries in Africa.

“WHO has identified 13 top priority countries (Algeria, Angola, Cote d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia) which either have direct links or a high volume of travel to China,” the U.N. agency said, noting that many of these countries identified suspected cases but have not confirmed them.

Currently, only six laboratories in the entire continent of Africa are prepared to test samples for coronavirus.

345,Boko Haram Threatens Nigerian Minister with Death,['Thomas D. Williams'],"The Boko Haram terror group released a new video Saturday threatening to kill Nigeria’s Minister of Communication after the latter stated he would interrupt the group’s lines of communication.

Isa Ali Pantami was appointed Nigeria’s Minister of Communications and Digital Economy last August and recently said that Nigeria needs to take the battle against Boko Haram to the digital sphere.

“It is evident that terrorists are exploiting social media, encrypted communications, and the dark web to spread propaganda, recruit new followers and coordinate attacks,” Pantami said during a lecture on counter-terrorism in Abuja last Tuesday.

“Through the use of Big Data Analytical, Nigeria’s military and intelligence agencies analyse data gathered to understand background, motives, modus operandi and methods of communication of persons or groups of interest,” he said.

“Increase in computing power and machine learning has made it possible to examine huge amounts of data related to crimes and terrorism to identify underlying correlations and causes,” Pantami added.

On Feb. 13, Pantami said it would be “a great injustice to the Nation” for public officials to allow the platform under our supervision and regulation to be used to commit crimes.”

Specifically, Mr. Pantami directed the National Communication Commission (NCC) earlier this month to ensure no Nigerian has more than three phone numbers.

According to the new regulations, use of a National Identity Number (NIN) will be required for Nigerians registering new SIM cards, whereas foreigners will need to use their passports and visas.

Pantami also directed the Commission to sanitize mobile networks of all unregistered SIMs.

Although Pantami is himself a Muslim and an imam, he is Western educated, having obtained a PhD from Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, Scotland, and is therefore despised by Boko Haram, whose name translates “Western education is forbidden.”

On Saturday, Boko Haram released a video in which its leader, Abubakar Shekau, taunted and threatened the Minister of Communication, accusing him of being a bad Muslim and a Western collaborator.

“I am speaking to those who pretend to be good Muslims but they are not,” Shekau said. “God will judge the hypocrites of Islam who use the platform of religion to achieve their selfish gains.”

“This video message is specifically released because of one man, who thinks he has the knowledge and is knowledgeable about religion. Keep this message in your heart until you die if you don’t repent,” he said.

Speaking in Hausa, Fulani, and Kanuri, Shekau said: “From today, you will continue to live in sorrow, because I, Shekau, say so on behalf of Allah, Allah hears us, he is the judge in the hereafter.”

“This warning is for Isa Ali Panatami; don’t think simply because you preach in English or because you are called a doctor, means you have knowledge of Islam. You know nothing,” he said. “Today you have become a minister, and you are feeling you can achieve your selfish ends. You must know that speaking English is not Islam.”

“You said you are going to block phone lines and other means of communication, to frustrate the activities of Boko Haram. But you must understand that we don’t depend on such to send out our messages,” he continued.

“Our messengers are like the angels of God. How dare you attempt to stop the works we are doing for the creator of the heavens and earth, simply because you have become a slave to the western world and the country,” Shekau said.

“I swear to Allah, you are nothing. Initially, we did not bother with you, but now you have become a slave to the infidels; repent now and become a good Muslim. If you don’t comply from now on, death will come to you, Isa Ali Pantami,” he warned.

“I call on my brothers in Africa, in Nigeria, and everywhere to arise and do what is necessary. Let them know that what we did to Sheikh Jafar is just the tip of the iceberg,” he declared, likely in reference to the 2007 assassination of Sheikh Jafar Mahmud Adam, an Islamic scholar shot dead in his mosque.

A close ally of Jafar’s, Muslim cleric Adam Albani who had criticized Boko Haram, was also shot dead in 2014.

“Anywhere you see Isa Ali Pantami, don’t spare him,” Shekau tells his followers in Saturday’s video.

“Even Jafar tried the same thing but we dealt with him; talk less of you that is nothing in Islam. And from today on, you would not have peace of mind because you have dared Allah, his prophet and the religion of Islam.”

The spokesperson for the Communications Minister, Uwa Suleiman, said in a statement that Mr. Pantami is not afraid of threats made by Shekau, adding that the minister will not take any special precautionary measures to protect himself.

“The minister is not scared,” she said.

346,Amnesty: Nigerian Military Torching Villages amid Boko Haram Attacks,['Ben Kew'],"The Nigerian military has “burned and forcibly displaced” entire villages in response to the recent escalation of terror attacks by the Islamic militants Boko Haram, according to a report from Amnesty International published Friday.

The organization used satellite data analysis and conducted interviews with those affected in Borno State. It reported numerous cases of Nigerian troops forcing the displacement of villagers, burning their property, and the arbitrary detention and consequent torture of civilians, all of which would amount to war crimes.

Residents interviewed described troops going house to house rounding people up before forcing them to walk to the main road and board trucks. Around 400 people were consequently taken to a camp for people displaced by the conflict in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, while their houses were burned to the ground.

“We saw our houses go into flames,” one 70-year-old told Amnesty. “We all started crying.”

Six men were also detained and held for almost a month at a facility where they were subjected to beatings and torture before being released without charge in January.

“These brazen acts of razing entire villages, deliberately destroying civilian homes and forcibly displacing their inhabitants with no imperative military grounds, should be investigated as possible war crimes,” said Osai Ojigho, Director of Amnesty International Nigeria.

“They repeat a longstanding pattern of the Nigerian military’s brutal tactics against the civilian population. Forces allegedly responsible for such violations must be suspended immediately and brought to justice,” he continued.

Amnesty International today called for an investigation into the alleged burning of villages by Nigerian military, in the fight against Boko Haram: https://t.co/k9uvLuGGtt pic.twitter.com/DL9DCGCO8E — Amnesty Int. Nigeria (@AmnestyNigeria) February 14, 2020

A spokesperson for the Nigerian military vehemently denied the allegations in a statement on Friday, claiming they were merely removing civilians from the line of combat. They also accused the human rights group of launching a “campaign of calumny targeting the Nigerian military” and supporting the Islamic caliphate.

“They say they saved us from Boko Haram, but it’s a lie,” a 65-year-old man told Amnesty. “Boko Haram isn’t coming to our village.”

The bombshell report was published as the Nigerian military faces continued national and international scrutiny for their failure to defeat Boko Haram, despite repeated claims from their leadership and even President Muhammed Buhari that the caliphate had been eradicated.

This past weekend, militants from the Islamic State-affiliated group killed at least 30 people by setting their cars alight while they were inside before abducting women and children in a raid in north-eastern Nigeria. Harrowing images from the scene charred bodies lying beside their vehicles, including a pregnant mother and her young child.

Boko Haram has waged a brutal insurgency across Nigeria since 2009, killing around 35,000, many of whom are targeted for being Christian or showing insufficient loyal to Islam. A recent report from the United Nations found that around 1.2 million Nigerians are still living in areas controlled by the caliphate, while two million have been displaced since its foundation.

347,Zimbabwe Opposition Wants Chinese Travelers Banned over Coronavirus,['John Hayward'],"The opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party in Zimbabwe pushed for a total ban on Chinese travelers on Wednesday in hopes of keeping the Wuhan coronavirus from spreading to Africa.

“We want an update on challenges and preparedness on coronavirus. We understand that other countries such as Russia and Australia have closed their borders to Chinese nationals to avoid the spread of the virus,” MDC leader Prosper Mutseyami said to the parliamentary session that began this week.

“Why is Zimbabwe still allowing Chinese visitors in the country? This issue needs to be addressed as soon as yesterday,” he said, demanding a statement from the Zimbabwean health minister on the state of coronavirus prevention.

Zimbabwe reportedly has 506 people who recently traveled to China under observation for possible coronavirus infection. The health ministry has asked these individuals to self-quarantine for at least two weeks.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there have been no reported cases of the coronavirus in Africa as of yet despite roughly a million Chinese nationals living on the continent.

WHO nevertheless considers Africa at “high risk” from the disease because visitors from China are likely to bring it eventually, and fighting epidemics is difficult in Africa. Epidemiologists have also considered the possibility of unreported infections on the continent and are watching for any sign of the disease spreading.

Kenya established its first two facilities to test for the coronavirus this week, taking some of the load off laboratories in South Africa and Senegal that have been handling all testing for the continent so far.

The Kenyan labs are said to be capable of processing test results within 24 hours of receiving samples. To date, seven suspected coronavirus patients have been tested in Kenya, with none of them testing positive for the disease.",https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/02/12/zimbabwe-opposition-wants-chinese-travelers-banned-over-coronavirus/
348,"Nigeria: Boko Haram Burns Motorists Alive, Abducts Dozens",['Ben Kew'],"Nigerian Boko Haram jihadists killed at least 30 people before abducting women and children in a raid in north-eastern Nigeria this weekend, a regional government spokesman announced on Monday.

The attack was carried out in Auno village, Borno State, around 20 kilometers from the regional capital of Maiduguri at around 22:00 on Sunday evening. Most of the victims are believed to have died when militants set fire to travelers sleeping in their cars.

“Many of the drivers and their assistants who were sleeping the vehicles were burnt alive,” civilian militia fighter Babakura Kolo told AFP, adding that they combed also stormed the local village, looting, and burning shops and property, before abducting numerous women and children and then fleeing the scene.

News of the attack was confirmed by state spokesperson Ahmad Abdurrahman Bundi, who said that the jihadists ambushed the scene trucks mounted with heavy weapons. They then proceeded to murder, burning and looting their victims.

“The attackers killed not less than 30 people who are mostly motorists and destroyed 18 vehicles,” Bundi said in a statement after visiting the scene.

Harrowing images from after the attack showed charred bodies lying beside their vehicles, including a pregnant mother and her young child. “They burn everywhere. The fire was still on till this morning,” one local resident told CNN. We are still looking for many people around here.”

The attack came barely three days after the Theatre Commander of Operation Lafiya Dole, Major General Olusegun Adeniyi, repeated the false claim that the Nigerian military had defeated the terror group, despite the fact that such horrific terror attacks remain a common occurrence.

“There is no inch of the Nigerian territory that is under the control of the Boko Haram insurgents. Since 2017, the army has technically defeated the Boko Haram terrorists and we have succeeded in taking over the areas captured from Boko Haram insurgents,” Gen. Adeniyi told journalists last at a press conference last Friday.

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, who has also repeatedly exaggerated the success of his military operations, told an African Union’s security council meeting in Addis Ababa on Monday that his government was working to secure the release of the group’s hostages.

“A number of school girls from Chibok and Dapchi earlier abducted by Boko Haram have regained their freedom,” he said. “We commend the gallant efforts of the MultiNational Joint Task Force and the partners in supporting the reintegration of the girls.” “Let me categorically reassure you of the steadfast commitment of the Government of Nigeria to ensure the freedom of all kidnapped children from the shackles of Boko Haram,” he continued.",https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/02/11/nigeria-boko-haram-burns-motorists-alive-abducts-dozens-of-women-and-children/
349,Kenya Arrests Illegal Chinese Chef for Whipping Waiter on Camera,['Frances Martel'],"Police in Kenya arrested four Chinese nationals, local media reported on Sunday, after a shocking video began circulating of one of them publicly flogging one of his employees, a Kenyan national, for allegedly being late to work.

The man whipping the Kenyan, a chief identified as Deng Hailan, was working in Kenya illegally; he possessed only a tourism visa to be allowed in the country. Deng was working as a chef in a hotel. Simon Oseko, the man being whipped in the video, told local media he felt he had no choice but to accept the abuse as he needed money from the job.

The case has outraged Kenya, already reeling from a growing list of incidents of Chinese nationals being abusive and racist against their Kenyan peers. China has embedded itself deeply in the Kenyan economy through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), offering Nairobi millions of dollars in predatory loans the country is ill-equipped to pay back. Chinese Belt and Road workers have stood accused of building an “apartheid” system at construction sites for development projects, beating Kenyan workers and banning Kenyan engineers from any skilled jobs.

China has also poured at least hundreds of its citizens into Kenya to do work that Beijing promised would go to locals and enrich Kenyan communities. Many of these Chinese citizens have overwhelmed the Kenyan immigration system by applying for tourist visas and using their time in Kenya to work illegally.

Deng, who police believe had done just that, was arrested alongside Chang Yueping, Ou Qiang and Yu Ling, three others working at the Chez Wou Restaurant at a hotel in Kileleshwa, a Nairobi suburb. Deng is believed to have been illegally working as a chef despite having a tourist visa. Chang and Ou were present in Kenya illegally, as their visas had expired. The fourth suspect, Yu, was also working at the restaurant with a visitors’ permit, violating the law, according to Kenya’s The Nation. A local officer told The Nation that the four Chinese will likely face charges of assault as well as illegally working in the country. The officer handling the case described them as “flight risks” and so should not be granted bail.

Deng caught the police’s attention through a video circulating on social media of a man believed to be him whipping Oseko, the waiter. Oseko pressed charges against Deng and claimed the assault occurred on February 2. He told police that Deng fired him after whipping him, without paying for the hours he had worked.

The video shows an Asian man urging the man identified as Oseko to bend over before whipping him, causing audible pain. Others can be heard laughing at the violence off-camera.

﻿

“I asked him why he was caning me and he bluntly asked me whether I wanted to continue working at the place,” Oseko said in an interview with Kenya’s The Standard. He said that similar beatings had occurred many times before Deng ultimately fired him.

“He gave me two strokes. It was so painful because I could not sit down,” he said. His boss then expected him to continue working.

The newspaper noted that remarks on social media indicated that many Kenyans wished to see the Chinese immediately deported, not punished within the Kenyan legal system at taxpayers’ expense. Police reportedly stated, however, that those arrested would, if found guilty, have to face Kenyan justice.

The case is the latest in a string of increasingly outrageous incidents of Chinese citizens violating Kenyan law, often through engaging in openly racist behavior. The large numbers of Chinese entering Kenya began traveling there after Nairobi signed onto the BRI and China offered to build the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR), an extensive rail line that would connect Nairobi to Mombasa, a port city on the Indian Ocean, and eventually connect Kenya to Rwanda, Uganda, and other neighbors. The first corridor of the SGR opened in July, over a year after reports began surfacing in The Standard and elsewhere of the Chinese workers creating an “apartheid” system at work sites.

The Standard published images in 2018 of Chinese workers banning Kenyans from sitting in the same eating spaces as the Chinese, banning them from sitting in the same transportation vehicles en route to work sites, and forcing Kenyan engineers with specialized degrees to perform unskilled labor. Chinese workers also refused to translate any instructions that come with equipment for building the railroad or controlling the rail line once it is built, ensuring that Kenya will need to constantly pay Chinese “experts” to keep the line running.

Reports of physical abuse of Kenyan workers at the sites also surfaced regularly, as did reports that a Chinese worker made a salary four times larger than a Kenyan for doing the same job. Those Chinese workers were conducting labor operations in Kenya illegally in many instances, officials later revealed.

“Insiders said besides the official numbers that have applied for work permits, there are hundreds of others behind the walls working using tourist visas who fly back home every six months for a short break, before jetting back in to pick up where they left,” The Standard wrote in 2018, two years before police arrested the four Chinese workers at the hotel restaurant this week for violating the terms of their permit.

In response to the scandal, the Kenyan government accused its own citizens of having insufficient “work ethic” and urged them to be more like the Chinese.

“Even as we talk about the [railway] and the racism and all that, it might be necessary for us as a country to change our work ethic,” government spokesman Eric Kiraithe said in 2018. “What we are expecting those Kenyans to do, those with an opportunity, is to shift the focus on the challenge at hand.”

Problems have persisted since the railway opened. In May 2019, police arrested four Chinese railway workers after video surfaced of the Chinese gang beating a Kenyan government inspector who had visited their site to ensure compliance with the law. The Chinese workers first reportedly allowed the engineer on their site. When the engineer discovered they were using substandard building materials, the Chinese allegedly tried to bribe him, then beat him when that failed.

Outside of the railway work, Chinese businessmen traveling to the country have been involved in racist spectacles that have triggered public outrage. Among the most prominent was a rant by businessman Liu Jiaqi, a motorcycle dealer, who a Kenyan employee recorded calling President Uhuru Kenyatta a “monkey” and demanding Kenyans be “like white people.”

“Every one, every Kenyan … like a monkey, even [Kenyan President] Uhuru Kenyatta. All of them,” Liu tells his employee’s camera. “I don’t belong to [sic] here. I don’t like here, like monkey people, I don’t like talk with them [sic], it smells bad, and poor, and foolish, and black. I don’t like them. Why not [like] the white people, like the American?”

350,"UK: Coronavirus 'Imminent Threat', Activates Emergency Powers",['Oliver Jj Lane'],"The British government has declared Coronavirus a “serious and imminent threat”, a classification which gives the secretary of state for health emergency powers to detain people suspected of being infected, as four more cases emerge.

Until now, the roughly 250 Britons quarantined at two hospitals after arriving back into the United Kingdom from China have been in isolation voluntarily on the advice of the government. But With the declaration “that the incidence or transmission of novel Coronavirus constitutes a serious and imminent threat to public health”, the hospitals in the UK become legally recognised as “isolation” areas, the Department of Health said in a statement.

This means the government can now keep people in isolation “for their own safety”, even if it is against their will, a spokesman for the department said.

State broadcaster the BBC reports this change in stance from the government came as one individual in the Wirral quarantine hospital was planning to leave against the advice of doctors before his two week incubation period isolation was complete. The Secretary of State for Health Matt Hancock declaring Coronavirus a “serious and imminent threat” permits the government to detail that individual and others to prevent the spread of the disease.

The government statement claimed the move is “considered as an effective means of delaying or preventing further transmission of the virus.”

Despite kicking up the classification of Coronavirus up a notch to serious and imminent, the overall threat level to the public issued by the government remains at “moderate”, while risk to individuals is “low”. When these threat levels were set in January, the Chief Medical Officer said in a statement that “This does not mean we think the risk to individuals in the UK has changed at this stage, but that government should plan for all eventualities.”

These developments come as another four UK cases of Coronavirus were announced Monday morning, bringing the national total to eight. There have been no UK fatalities from the virus.

Seven of these cases so far have been infected by one person, the eight patient who has been dubbed a “super spreader”. The so-called super spreader is a UK businessman who caught Coronavirus in Singapore before passing it on to seven other people on a ski holiday in France before returning to the United Kingdom, at which point he began to show symptoms.

British newspaper The Daily Telegraph reports UK health authorities are attempting to track anyone who “two metres of him for more than 15 minutes in the two weeks before his diagnosis”. The ski resort where the man stayed has been quarantined.",https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/02/10/uk-declares-coronavirus-serious-and-imminent-threat-activates-emergency-powers/
351,Nigerian Lawmakers: Foreign Governments May Be Funding Boko Haram,['Ben Kew'],"The Islamic terrorist organization Boko Haram may be receiving funding from foreign governments, revealed Babajimi Benson, the Chairman of the Nigerian House Committee on Defense, on Wednesday.

Last week, an emergency meeting with military chiefs was called in response to the continued threat and instability posed by Boko Haram across Nigeria, after the House of Representatives passed a resolution calling for all their resignations.

Speaking to journalists after the closed-door meeting, Benson admitted that “there could be some truth” to allegations that foreign powers are funding a Boko Haram insurgency across the country. However, he stressed that further details or suspicions of suspected countries would remain private.

“There is probably an international dimension to what we see. There is ISIS, there is ISWAP [ISIS West Africa]. These are things that we need to discuss in a very classified manner,” he explained. “But what we want Nigerians to know is that we are committed to them, 100 percent, to see that we assist the military and the armed forces and ensuring that this matter is put to an end within the shortest possible time.”

“We were to a large extent satisfied with what they said. Like I said, we are also going to table what they said before parliament,” he continued. “We are going to discuss; we are going to have a very robust discussion on how to assist, to end this war. It is Nigeria that is at war.”

Benson did not specifically name any individual governments that may be funding Boko Haram.

Asked if the decision to not sack any of the military chiefs represented a U-turn on the House of Representatives’ resolution, Benson pointed out that the “decision lies with the executive.”

“It is not a U-turn but the most important thing that Nigerians want is the security of their lives and for their properties to be protected. Sacking the service chiefs is what we can suggest, but it is a function of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces; the buck stops at his table,” he said.

Speaker of the House Femi Gbajabiamila told journalists following the meeting that the military chiefs had been asked to explain why their constituents are “dying callously in ways that you can just imagine if there’s no security.”

“This is one of those meetings which, like I said, is going to be continuous and to find out exactly what is going on, what the issues are and what the problems are,” said Gbajabiamila. “We know what the basic problems are. We know our committees are capable of handling these issues. Therefore, solutions to insecurity in the country must be thought of outside the box by taking the fight to these criminals.”

Nigerian military chiefs have repeatedly made false claims about the success of their operations and the strength of Boko Haram. On one occasion, the military mistakenly bombed a refugee camp hosting the group’s victims. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has periodically declared victory over the organization, only for them to continue staging brutal attacks and methods of operation shortly afterward.

The organization has carried out multiple resurgences in recent years including dozens of attacks, kidnappings, and other crimes against humanity, with a particular emphasis on Christian communities. Last July, they carried out an attack on a funeral ceremony in northeastern Nigeria that left 65 people dead. In November, a report from the United Nations found that around 1.2 million Nigerians are living in areas controlled by Boko Haram, while around 35,000 people have lost their lives at the hands of the caliphate.

352,South Africa Issues Arrest Warrant for Former President Jacob Zuma,['John Hayward'],"A South African court issued an arrest warrant for former president Jacob Zuma on Tuesday after the 77-year-old skipped a court date for his fraud and racketeering trial, ostensibly because he needed medical treatment. Zuma’s warrant was stayed until the scheduled resumption of his trial on May 6.

Reuters reported some comedy from the courtroom, as the judge frowned upon a rather dodgy sick note tendered by Zuma’s lawyer, who went on to admit his client might not even be in the country:

Zuma’s lawyer presented the judge with a sick note from what he said was a military hospital, but Judge Dhaya Pillay questioned whether the note was valid, as there was no medical number showing if and where the doctor was certified. “I don’t even know if [he] … is a doctor. There is … nothing to suggest that he is,” she said, before issuing the warrant. The former leader is on trial on 18 charges of fraud, racketeering and money laundering relating to a $2 billion arms deal with French defense firm Thales in 1999, when Zuma was deputy president. He rejects the allegations as a politically motivated witch-hunt. Dan Mantsha, Zuma’s lawyer, said that he was abroad for medical treatment, without saying where. Local media have suggested he is in Cuba, although it was not immediately possible to verify this.

The judge grilled Mantsha on Zuma’s condition and found the lawyer unable to answer most questions about his medical condition. She also noticed that the date on the sick note appeared to have been altered, and the paperwork described not a proper medical evaluation but a “layman’s diagnosis with the patient’s consent.”

“What does this mean?” asked Judge Pillay. “It is puzzling that there is a reference to a layman’s diagnosis, and what the patient is giving consent to is unclear.”

Zuma’s alleged offenses occurred before he became president of South Africa in 2009. His nine-year stint in the presidency put the Thales prosecution on hold until mounting legal and political pressure jump-started the case in 2018, when his own African National Congress (ANC) party forced him from office over a different corruption scandal.

Zuma, through his lawyers, maintains he is being used as a “scapegoat” for corruption charges that should have been directed at Thabo Mbeki, who was president in 1999. He tried to have the case thrown out for an “unreasonable delay in the commencement of proceedings” during his previous court appearance, but his request was denied.",https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/02/04/south-africa-issues-arrest-warrant-for-former-president-jacob-zuma/
353,Palestinians Claim ‘Stab in Back’ over Sudan-Israel Normalization,['Deborah Danan'],"TEL AVIV – Israel and the Muslim-Arab country of Sudan will begin normalizing ties, Israeli officials said after leaders of both countries met in Uganda, in a move that has been denounced as a “stab in the back” by the Palestinians.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met secretly in Entebbe, Uganda, with Sudanese leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan on Monday.

“It was agreed to start cooperation leading to normalization of the relationship between the two countries,” an Israeli statement said.

The meeting came days after Sudan joined the Arab League in rejecting President Donald Trump’s recently unveiled Middle East peace plan.

“This meeting is a stab in the back of the Palestinian people and a stark departure from the Arab Peace Initiative at a time when the administration of President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu are trying to liquidate the Palestinian cause,” senior Palestinian official Saeb Erekat told the Palestinian Authority’s official news agency WAFA.

“We agreed to begin cooperation that will lead to normalization of relations between the two countries,” Netanyahu tweeted. “History!”

נפגשתי באנטבה עם יו""ר מועצת הריבונות של סודן, עבד אלפתח אלברהאן, והסכמנו להתחיל שיתוף פעולה שיוביל לנורמליזציה של היחסים בין שתי המדינות. היסטוריה! — Benjamin Netanyahu (@netanyahu) February 3, 2020

The Saudi-led 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, endorsed by the Arab League, calls for normalization between Israel and Arab countries on the condition of Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem and arriving at a settlement for the so-called “right of return” for Palestinian refugee and their descendants into Israel.

Trump’s plan, entitled “Vision for Peace” and roundly rejected by the Palestinians, would see the establishment of a contiguous but demilitarized Palestinian state on most of the West Bank with parts of eastern Jerusalem that are outside the Israeli security fence as its capital.

Jerusalem would remain undivided and under Israeli control.

Israel would be allowed to annex all Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Jordan Valley.

Erekat also denounced Uganda’s announcement that it would weigh the possibility of opening an embassy in Jerusalem.

At their meeting Monday, Netanyahu told Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, “You open an embassy in Jerusalem, I’ll open an embassy in Kampala. And we hope to do this in the near future.”

Sudan and Israel are erstwhile enemies, with Khartoum being the backdrop to the infamous “Three No’s” issued by the Arab League during its summit in the Sudanese capital in 1967. Arab states at the time agreed that there would be “no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, and no negotiations with it.”

Until recently, Sudan was considered by Israel to be a security threat over Iran’s suspected use of the country to smuggle arms into the Gaza Strip. However, Khartoum has distanced itself from Iran over its involvement in Yemen and that, together with the ouster last year of country’s longtime ruler Omar al-Bashir, means that the threat no longer exists.",https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/02/04/palestinians-slam-stab-in-back-over-sudan-israel-normalization/
354,Kenya: 14 Children Killed at End of School Stampede,['Ben Kew'],"Fourteen children were killed and dozens more injured following a stampede on Monday at the end of classes at a primary school in western Kenya, local authorities announced.

The tragedy was confirmed by Western Region Police Commander Peris Kimani, although he could not provide further details.

“We have launched an investigation to establish what exactly happened,” he said, amid some reports suggesting that the staircase collapsed and that some children fell from the third floor of the building.

Education Minister George Magoha told Citizen TV, “The loss of a child is very painful. My condolences to parents who have lost their children.”

The Red Cross was one of the first organizations on the ground responding to the incident.

“As kids were going home from school there was a stampede as they were going down the stairs,” said Red Cross Kenya spokesperson Peter Abwao. “It’s a three-story building, it’s a classroom block.”

At least 39 children were wounded, although 20 were treated at a nearby hospital and have already been discharged. The condition of those still in hospital is thought to be more severe.

The tragedy raises further questions about the safety of Kenya’s schools and other forms of infrastructure. Former prime minister and current leader of the opposition Raila Odinga declared “there must be an immediate and thorough probe to get to the bottom of this incident.”

“My heartfelt condolences to parents that have lost loved ones in the unfortunate and regrettable tragedy at Kakamega Primary School,” he wrote on Twitter. “I wish a quick recovery to the injured children and pray that God grant strength to the affected families”:

In September last year, nine pupils died and dozens more were injured after a classroom collapsed at a school in central Nairobi. The school’s principal, Moses Ndirangu, blamed the collapse on the construction of a nearby sewage system, which he said had weakened the foundations of the building.

Days later, the Kenyan government announced the closure of St Catherine’s Children Education Centre Bombolulu near Nairobi over safety concerns.

“We are acting in the best interest of our children. This building is not any different from the one that collapsed in Dagoretti. If anything happens I will be the one to blame,” Magoha said at the time. “This is just a start and we are going to crack down on all schools in the country with poor structures.”

355,African Countries Identify 12 Suspected Cases of Chinese Coronavirus,['Ben Kew'],"The ongoing Chinese coronavirus epidemic has now reached the shores of Africa with at least four countries reporting suspected cases of the disease across the continent as of Monday.

Suspected cases of the virus, which was first identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan, have been reported in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Botswana, all of whom announced they were investigating three, four, five cases respectively.

The contagion comes despite the fact that practically all African governments imposed strict screening at all points of entry such as airports and land borders.

Last week, the World Health Organisation (WHO) announced it had identified 13 other African countries as high-risk countries for the novel coronavirus, mainly because of their close links to China, whose communist regime has aggressively embedded itself through economic investment.

“WHO has identified 13 top priority countries (Algeria, Angola, Cote d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia) which either have direct links or a high volume of travel to China,” the organization said in a statement.

“Active screening at airports has been established in a majority of these countries and while they will be WHO first areas of focus, the organization will support all countries in the region in their preparation efforts,” it continued.

Another concern among health experts is that the virus will spread in countries with poor healthcare systems, a point emphasized by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus when he declared the outbreak as an international health emergency.

“The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in China, but because of what is happening in other countries,” he said. “Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems, and which are ill-prepared to deal with it.”

On Sunday evening, China’s Health Commission announced that 17,205 cases had been confirmed nationwide, with 361 people dying as a result. This makes the outbreak more serious than the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak (SAR) in 2003, where 349 people died across China.

Many countries have warned against practically all travel to and from the Chinese mainland, including the U.S., while numerous airlines have suspended flights. Beijing remains unhappy with the measure, and accused the U.S. of “spreading fear” over the outbreak.

“Some countries, the U.S. in particular, have inappropriately overreacted, which certainly runs counter to WHO advice,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying in a written statement.

“The U.S. government has not provided any substantial assistance to us, but it was the first to evacuate personnel from its Consulate in Wuhan, the first to suggest partial withdrawal of its embassy staff and the first to impose a travel ban on Chinese travelers,” she continued. “All it has done could only create and spread fear, which is a bad example.”

China’s eagerness to reduce the impact of the virus was underlined on Monday after the Shanghai Composite Index fell by nearly eight percent amid concerns over the growing number of cases, the largest fall for over four years.

356,Tanzania Mourns 40 Killed in Church Stampede and Floods,['John Hayward'],"Tanzania mourned at least 20 people killed in a stampede at a Pentecostal church on Saturday, plus another 20 killed by floods caused by torrential rains.

Boniface Mwamposa, the popular pastor of the church where the stampede occurred, was arrested while trying to flee the country after the deadly incident.

According to the authorities, Pastor Mwamposa of the Arise and Shine Ministry Tanzania, noted for referring to himself as “The Apostle,” packed thousands of people into a sports stadium in the town of Moshi near Mount Kilimanjaro on Saturday night.

During the event, Mwamposa poured “blessed oil” on the ground and told his followers to walk on it, promising they would gain prosperity and be cured of disease. Twenty people were killed and 16 others injured when the crowd surged forward to do as Mwamposa suggested.

“It was horrible, people trampled on mercilessly, jostling each other with elbows,” an eyewitness told AFP. “It was like the preacher had thrown bundles of dollars about … and there were all these deaths!”

“The incident took place at night and there were many people, so there is a possibility that more casualties could emerge. We are still assessing the situation,” Moshi district commissioner Kippi Warioba said on Saturday.

Warioba said Mwamposa “tried to flee after this incident, but we arrested him in Dar es Salaam,” a port city from which Mwamposa might have hoped to leave the country. On Sunday the police broadcast a televised appeal to Mwamposa to hand himself in.

“He will be held accountable for causing this tragedy,” Warioba promised. Among other likely charges, Mwamposa has been accused of violating the terms of the permit he obtained for the sports stadium service and making inadequate preparations for such an enormous crowd.

“There has been a rise in the number of pastors who claim they can perform ‘miracle cures’ and eradicate poverty in Africa in recent years. Preachers who spread what they call the ‘prosperity gospel’ have been involved in financial scams and money laundering schemes, as well as other stampedes,” the Associated Press noted on Sunday.

Flash floods caused by torrential rains swept through 16 villages over the weekend and killed up to 20 people, leaving some 15,000 others homeless.

The floods destroyed a great deal of farmland, killed livestock, ruined buildings, wiped out roads, and disrupted other vital infrastructure.

Tanzanian President John Magufuli issued a statement mourning the dead from both stampede and flooding, declaring himself “very sorry for these deaths.”

Magufuli has been criticized by the U.S. government for deteriorating human rights in Tanzania, and there is some doubt he can be trusted to run a free and fair election in October. Sweden announced on Monday it will reduce foreign aid to Tanzania due to “negative democratic developments in the country.”

The Tanzanian opposition on Monday asked for international support to “stand up for Tanzanians so they can choose their own future without fear and avoid being forced into a one-party state against their choosing.”",https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/02/03/tanzania-least-20-killed-church-stampede-after-pastor-pours-blessed-oil/
357,Archbishop Protests Murders: Nigeria Is ‘Drifting Toward Anarchy’,['Thomas D. Williams'],"The ongoing killings of Christians in Nigeria indicate that the country is “drifting towards anarchy,” said Lagos Archbishop Alfred Adewale Martins following the murder of an 18-year-old seminarian last week.

In a statement on the diocesan website, the archbishop (pictured) lamented the death of the young seminarian, Michael Nnadi, who had been abducted along with three others in Kaduna State. The other three young seminarians were released but Mnadi was executed by his captors.

“This was a young man who abandoned all with the desire to serve His creator and humanity, now murdered for no just cause,” the archbishop said, while noting that this latest murder was just one of several cases of innocent Nigerians being shot dead on daily basis “while our security services and their chiefs watch as if they were helpless.”

Martins noted the rise in insurgency and the inability of the federal government to arrest the situation, describing it as a symbol of failure in the current security arrangement of the state.

The archbishop also warned that the constant killings of Nigerians should not go unchecked and a mass arrest of the perpetrators should be carried out in the nearest future.

“This appalling situation must come to an end,” his statement said. “We cannot just fold our arms and allow these monstrous activities to continue to thrive. The consequences of the dastardly acts on the psyche of Nigerians can only be imagined. The Federal Government must act now before things get out of hand.”

The only way the government can reassure the people that they are committed to their welfare is to “enforce mass arrest of the perpetrators and bring an end to the menace of kidnapping across the land,” he said.

Warning that the situation could make people start taking laws into their hands, the archbishop urged the president to look into the nation’s security structure and fix it.

“For a while now, many Nigerians from different walks of life have been calling for a revamping of the security arrangements in the nation even if it means the replacement of the Heads of the various Security Agencies in order to give room for new ideas,” Martin said. “It is beyond doubt that the gains of the past few years are being lost because those at the helm of affairs and the soldiers in the thick of the war are tired and need to be replaced.”

Meanwhile, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) organized prayer services and protests across the country Sunday to draw the Federal Government’s attention to the escalating killings, abductions, and insecurity across the nation.

The group protested the recent brutal killing of Lawan Andimi, the CAN Chairman in Michika Local Government Area of Adamawa State, by Boko Haram terrorists, as well as a number of other killings in the nation.

“The prayer walk was aimed at offering prayers and supplications unto God to save Nigeria from being consumed by insurgents, terrorists, bandits, kidnappers, armed robbers, militants and ritualists in all our states,” said CAN representative Pastor Adeboye.

“Furthermore, we declared that Jesus who is the Prince of Peace is our Lord and King,” the pastor said. “We carried and displayed several placards saying ‘No’ to further killings and demanding that the Federal and State governments should rise up to their civic responsibility of securing the lives and properties of her citizens.”

In his speech, Adeboye also proposed that “the security infrastructure in our nation be overhauled and improved drastically,” in the hope that current security challenges “will be a thing of the past.”

358,Catholics in Nigeria Appeal to the West: ‘Make Known the Atrocities’,['Thomas D. Williams'],"The president of the Nigerian bishops’ conference has launched an appeal to the West to “make known the atrocities” being suffered by Christians throughout the country.

Nigeria is living in an unprecedented climate of insecurity not seen since the civil war of 1967-1970, which is particularly affecting Christians, said the President of the Bishops’ Conference, Augustine Obiora Akubeze, Archbishop of Benin City.

While “in the past security problems were limited to the north-east of Nigeria, now there is insecurity throughout the whole country,” the archbishop said in an interview with the papal foundation Aid to the Church in Need (ACN).

In the face of this “serious lack of security and the increase in anti-Christian attacks,” the prelate called on Western governments and media to “make known the atrocities” taking place in Nigeria. “In this way our government may feel pressure and act,” the archbishop said, and in this way the other nations of the international community may “feel a moral obligation to protect the lives of Christians and all Nigerians who are constantly attacked and killed by Boko Haram and the Islamist Fulani herdsmen.”

The archbishop decried the fact that:

…ninety-five percent of the government representatives are Muslims, in a country where there are about 50 percent Christians and the ones who should ensure our safety belongs to a sect of a religion, to a single ethnic group, in a multi-religious, multi-ethnic nation.

Meanwhile, the executive branch does not do enough to stem “the emergency represented by the violence of the Islamist Fulani herdsmen” and to protect churches and convents, he said.

“The lack of significant prosecutions against them further fuels the belief that they enjoy the support of the federal government,” Akubeze said. Meanwhile, given the lack of state assistance, security is left entirely to the Christian community that has to pay even “to have the protection of the police during Sunday Masses.”

Referring in particular to the recent kidnapping of four seminarians, one of whom was later executed, Archbishop Akubeze recalled that this is nothing new for the local Catholic community since “many priests and religious have been kidnapped recently.”

Catholics are not the only victims of religious violence in the country, however. This past month, the Rev. Lawan Andimi, a local leader of the Christian Association of Nigeria, was beheaded by jihadists in the northeast after having been kidnapped in early January by an armed group of the so-called Islamic State.

“So Buhari is shocked by the killing of Lawan Andima?” the bishop asks. “Many Nigerians wonder whether the president lives in a parallel universe.”

“How can he be surprised after some of us have attended numerous mass burials of Christians killed by Boko Haram?” he added.

His appeal to the international community is to talk as much as possible about the “atrocities taking place in Nigeria” and to put pressure on the local government to establish measures to protect the community. The prelate said:

Our hope is that the nations of the European Union and the United States will feel a moral obligation to protect the lives of Christians and all Nigerians who are constantly attacked and killed by Boko Haram and the Fulani herdsmen.

For his part, Archbishop Matthew Manoso Ndagoso of Kaduna, the diocese where the four seminarians were kidnapped by jihadists last month, summarized the situation succinctly: “We are under siege.”

359,Catholic Seminarian Executed in Nigeria by Presumed Islamists,['Thomas D. Williams'],"One of the four Catholic seminarians abducted by unidentified gunmen last month in Nigeria was found dead Saturday afternoon.

The other three kidnapped seminarians were set free last week, while the body of their companion, 18-year-old Michael Nnadi, was discovered dead Saturday. Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah of Sokoto, issued a statement confirming the death late Saturday.

“With a heavy heart, I want to inform you that our beloved son Michael was killed by bandits on a date that we cannot confirm. He and the wife of a doctor were arbitrarily separated from the group and executed. The rector identified the body of the young man this afternoon,” the prelate declared.

As Breitbart News reported last month, gunmen stormed the Good Shepherd Catholic Major Seminary in Kaduna State, central Nigeria, on January 8, kidnapping four seminary students. Wearing military fatigues, the assailants arrived at the seminary around 10:30pm and began shooting at students, professors, and staff members, in a raid that lasted about a half hour.

While the identity of the kidnappers is still unclear, a recent string of violent acts against Christians by Muslim radicals in central Nigeria suggests the attack was religiously motivated.

In its report on the incident, Vatican News adopted this theory, noting that the attack “was all too familiar in a region where Boko Haram and other Islamist groups use brutal and brazen methods to reinforce their reign of terror.”

The jihadists engage in kidnapping as a means of attracting media attention to their cause as well as forced recruitment to their ranks, Vatican News noted, but also as a means of financing their operations through ransom demands.

In its World Watch List 2020, Christian persecution watchdog group Open Doors placed Nigeria at number 12 of the 50 countries with the highest rates of persecution.

“Christians in the northern region and in the Middle Belt suffer from violence perpetrated by Islamic extremist groups such as militant Fulani herdsmen and Boko Haram,” the report stated. “Such violence often results in loss of life, physical injury, as well as loss of property.”

“As a result of the violence, Christians are also being dispossessed of their land and means of livelihood—and Christians with a Muslim background also face rejection from their own families,” it noted.

The Bishop of Sokoto said he had to delay the announcement of the death of Michael Nnadi until he could inform the young man’s mother. “The Lord knows what is best, let us stay strong and pray for the repose of his soul,” the bishop wrote.

Thomas Heine-Geldern, president of the Pontifical Foundation Aid to the Church in Need (ACN) International, said on last month that the situation of Christians in Nigeria resembles what the faithful suffered under the Islamic State in the Middle East.

“In that situation, Christians were kidnapped, assaulted, and killed because they had no protection from the State. This should not be allowed to happen to Christians in Nigeria. The government has to act now before it is too late,” Heine-Geldern stated.",https://www.breitbart.com/africa/2020/02/02/catholic-seminarian-executed-in-nigeria-by-presumed-islamists/
360,Twelve-Year-Old Girl Dies After Genital Mutilation Procedure in Egypt,['Amy Furr'],"A young girl died this week after a doctor performed female genital mutilation (FGM) on her in the Assiut province of southern Egypt.

Following the 12-year-old’s death, a public prosecutor ordered that her parents and the doctor be arrested, according to the Associated Press (AP).

“In Egypt, 92 percent of women and girls aged 15-49 have undergone some form of FGM,” the United Nations Fund for Population Activities Egypt (UNFPA) website stated.

The practice involves the cutting or removal of female sexual organs and is used as a misguided preventative measure to keep women from having sex before marriage, according to Breitbart News. While many of the cases occur among Muslim families, FGM is not exclusive to Islam and much more common in Africa than in any other part of the world. Often, the procedure occurs in areas with limited hygiene and a lack of medical supplies, and is done by senior tribal members or other non-medical professionals.

“Female genital mutilation (FGM) is still widespread – but increasingly condemned – throughout much of North and East Africa. However, the recent history of the practice in Egypt presents special challenges for those trying to end it,” the UNFPA site read.

Not only does the procedure hurt the victim physically, but it can also lead to long-term mental health issues. Experts have identified no legitimate medical reason for a woman to ever undergo FGM.

In 2016, Egypt implemented an amended law that made penalties harsher for those who performed the ancient procedure, according to Breitbart News.

“The nation’s health ministry reportedly announced the enactment of the amendment, which increases punishment for FGM to felony charges, with up to 15 years in prison, from a misdemeanor, with a maximum of three years behind bars,” the article stated.

Human rights lawyer Reda el-Danbouki said the law only criminalizes FGM in cases where “there is no medical justification.”

“This clause opens the door to parents as well as physicians to claim that they were not conducting female circumcision but simply removing allegedly discomforting skin growth,” he noted, adding that judges are not convinced FGM is a crime.

“Judges are lenient when it comes to cases entailing violence against women,” Danbouki said.

Friday, managing director of the Tadwein Gender Research Center, Amel Fahmy, commented that unless there is “true criminalization of the practice,” it will continue.

“Many more Egyptian girls will be forced to undergo the procedure, and many of them will die,” Fahmy concluded.",https://www.breitbart.com/crime/2020/01/31/twelve-year-old-girl-dies-after-genital-mutilation-procedure-egypt/
361,Parents Convicted in First Female Genital Mutilation Case in Ireland,['Kurt Zindulka'],"An African couple in Dublin has been convicted of having female genital mutilation (FGM) performed on their 21-month-old daughter, in the first such case in the Republic of Ireland.

A man and wife of African origin have been jailed after they “aided and abetted, counselled or procured” someone to perform female genital mutilation upon their 21-month-old daughter. The man has been sentenced to five-and-a-half years and his wife will serve a term of four years and nine months.

The couple, who will remain unnamed to protect the identity of the child, pleaded not guilty to procuring FGM, claiming in the trial that their daughter had suffered the injury as a result of falling onto a toy while not wearing a diaper, according to RTE.

Their version of events was disputed health professionals in the trial who argued that it was clearly a case of female genital mutilation. Sri Paran, the paediatric surgeon who performed surgery on the girl to stop the bleeding, said that the injury was not accidental.

Sentencing the African couple, Judge Elma Sheahan said that the child suffered an “appalling act of cruelty” in the “most egregious breach of trust by those presumed to be the protectors of their infant child”.

Female Genital Mutilation: Five Lessons U.S. Lawmakers Can Learn from Europe https://t.co/gNL9DEd0w3 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 22, 2018

The practise of FGM, in which the cutting or removing of female sex organs is performed on girls, is common within the cultures of some African nations and Muslim-majority countries, where it is used as a preventative measure against women having sex before marriage.

The barbaric procedure not only impacts victims physically but can also lead to long-lasting mental health issues later in life.

Female genital mutilation was first criminalised in the Republic of Ireland in 2012 and carries a maximum sentence of 14 years, however, no one has been jailed for the offence until now.

Detective Chief Superintendent Declan Daly said that the couple’s sentencing sends a strong and important message that Female Genital Mutilation will not be tolerated in the country. He said: “It is a heinous and barbaric practice which is a criminal offence in Ireland.”

In October, Breitbart London reported that as many as 6,000 women and girls have had their genitals mutilated in Ireland, with another 3,000 currently at risk of having the gruesome procedure inflicted upon them.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that over 200 million women and girls have been subjected to FGM and every year three million girls are in danger of having their genitals cut.

362,Billionaire Forced to Apologize for Telling Trump ‘Africa Loves You’,['Joshua Caplan'],"South African billionaire Patrice Motsepe on Tuesday was forced to apologize for telling President Donald Trump that “Africa loves you” after receiving a backlash from lawmakers.

Motsepe heaped praise on the president during a dinner at last week’s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, prompting African lawmakers to speak out.

“Africa loves America. Africa loves you. It is very, very important,” Motsepe told President Trump. “We want America to do well. We want you to do well. The success of America is the success of the rest of the world.”

The president then thanked the businessman and philanthropist for his glowing praise, replying: “You’ve done a great job, thank you very much.”

South African Finance Minister Tito Mboweni responded to the billionaire’s comments by stressing his views were made as a private citizen, not a government representative.

KwaZulu-Natal province premier Sihle Zikalala issued more pointed criticism, stating South Africa has nothing to gain from the president.

In a statement released Tuesday, Motsepe said the debate over his remarks had exposed him to different views.

“I have a duty to listen to these differing views and would like to apologize. I do not have the right to speak on behalf of anybody except myself,” he said.

Motsepe said his remarks were partly aimed at encouraging discussions between the Trump administration and African political leaders amid, “increasing feedback from certain American political and business leaders that South Africa and some African countries are anti-America and its political leadership.”

Motsepe, the first black African on the Forbes billionaires list and brother-in-law of South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, was attending a dinner of business leaders from around the world including FIFA president Gianni Infantino, the CEOs of Siemens and Saudi Aramco and the Ivory Coast-born CEO of Credit Suisse, Tidjane Thiam.

363,U.N. Provides $19 Million to East Africa to Help Tame Desert Locusts,['Ben Kew'],"“This devastating locust outbreak is starting to destroy vegetation across East Africa with alarming speed and ferocity,” Lowcock said in a statement. “Vulnerable families that were already dealing with food shortages now face the prospect of watching as their crops are destroyed before their eyes.”

More than $10M has been released from @UNCERF in response to the devastating desert locust outbreak in East Africa. It's the worst of its kind for 25 years in Ethiopia & Somalia – and the worst Kenya has seen for 70 years. https://t.co/8t2uL6S1uG pic.twitter.com/dHUmvw3zq5 — United Nations (@UN) January 25, 2020

He explained that the funding would be used to fund a “massive scale-up in aerial operations to manage the outbreak.” It is estimated that it will take around $70 million to fully manage the situation.

“If left unchecked, this outbreak has the potential to spill over into more countries in East Africa with horrendous consequences,” he continued. “A swift and determined response to contain it is essential.”

As explained by the Food and Agriculture Organization, desert locusts are among the most hostile and dangerous pests in the world:

A single locust can travel 150km and eat its own weight in food – about two grams – each day. A small swarm can consume the equivalent of food for 35,000 people in one day. They reproduce rapidly and, if left unchecked, their current numbers could grow 500 times by June.

The outbreak is also exacerbating the effects of adverse climatic conditions. Vegetation in Ethiopia has already been badly damaged by floods, while Kenya has also experienced two consecutive years of drought followed by major flooding.

Last week, the Director-General of the U.N. FOA, Qu Dongyu, warned that the situation was now a crisis of “international dimensions.”

“Authorities in the region have already jump-started control activities, but in view of the scale and urgency of the threat, additional financial backing from the international donor community is needed so they can access the tools and resources required to get the job done,” said Qu.

“Communities in Eastern Africa have already been impacted by extended droughts, which have eroded their capacities to grow food and make a living,” he continued. “We need to help them get back on their feet, once the locusts are gone.”

As well as the Horn of Africa, the locusts could potentially wreak havoc in parts of Southwest Asia and the Red Sea, with reports of large desert locust swarms breeding in India, Iran, and Pakistan since June ofg last year. An uptick in breeding activity in countries such as Egypt, Eritrea, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Yemen also increases the risk of a large-scale outbreak.

364,Boys Form Singing Group on Streets of Madagascar's Capital City,['Amy Furr'],"A group of eight young boys in Antananarivo, Madagascar, are touching hearts all over the world by singing songs together.

In 2018, Virginia Summers and her husband, John Miller, who works at the U.S. Embassy, heard a teenager making music as they drove through the streets of Madagascar’s capital city, according to CBS News.

“The first song that we heard was Jimmy singing, and it was a song of giving thanks to God for his life,” Summers recalled, adding that the lyrics moved her deeply since they were in a place where most people live on less than $2 a day.

Once the couple located him, they discovered he had started an a cappella group called Zaza Kanto with his talented friends.

“They are amongst the poorest of the poor in Madagascar, and it’s just almost inconceivable that this could have been happening. Yet, there it was,” Miller said.

They decided to take videos of the group singing and post them on YouTube and social media so the whole world could hear their beautiful voices.

So far, the videos have been viewed millions of times.

The boys said the world around them is how they learned to make such beautiful music.

“I hear people singing outside, so I tried to copy,” said 12-year-old Njato.

Summers and Miller set up a website for the group so people could donate money to help provide housing and education through the National Christian Foundation (NCF).

“The money raised here with your help will be distributed through charitable organizations operating in Madagascar with the administrative expertise and cultural knowledge to ensure the funds are used to build a real future for these children,” the site read.

​When Miller’s colleague at the embassy, Nicole Bayer, heard the group sing, she invited them to perform at an event she was planning for a cultural exchange program called American Music Abroad.

“For us, it’s important to build bridges of understanding between Americans and the countries where we serve,” she said.

Now, Summers goes to the boy’s hostel, called the Underground, every Sunday to hear them perform on the street.

“This is something that is so meaningful for us, to create a relationship with these boys,” she commented, adding, “It’s something that they give to us, quite frankly.”",https://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/01/26/watch-boys-form-singing-group-streets-madagascars-capital-city/
365,Macron Sends Defence Sec to U.S. to Beg Trump to Keep Troops in Africa,['Breitbart London'],"(AFP) — France’s defence minister departs for Washington on Sunday hoping to convince officials to keep U.S. soldiers in West Africa, where French authorities are under pressure after years of trying to bolster local forces against Islamic extremists.

Florence Parly’s visit comes just days after her tour of the Sahel region, a vast arid expanse where states have little more than nominal control, allowing jihadist fighters to flourish.

Paris and its allies consider the region increasingly critical for ensuring Europe’s security against jihadist threats and for stemming an unchecked flow of migrants across the Mediterranean.

The United States has been a key ally for France’s 4,500-member Barkhane operation, providing intelligence and surveillance via drones as well as in-flight refuelling and logistical transport, at a cost of $45 million a year.

“The American commitment to the region is essential because they provide critical capabilities, some of which cannot be replaced,” an official in the French presidency told AFP this week.

But President Donald Trump insists the U.S. must focus on containing Russia and China, with Africa seen as less of a direct threat — and one that should be left to France and the European Union.

American military chiefs have confirmed they are considering a drawdown of troops from Africa.

“I want to make sure, as we look at counterterrorism, that I first and foremost am addressing threats to the homeland,” U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper told journalists this week.

General Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, has said a decision on the deployment of 7,000 U.S. special forces in Africa, particularly those in the Sahel, could come by early March.

“The question that we are working with the French on is the level of effort we are supporting the French with,” he said. “Is it too much? Too little? About right?”

France’s Macron Uses D-Day Speech to Lecture Trump on NATO, European Union https://t.co/av9MQ69Adk — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 6, 2019

Risky withdrawal

President Emmanuel Macron admitted a U.S. pullout would be “very bad news,” after a summit with France’s five Sahel partners earlier this month — not least because EU nations have shown little enthusiasm to join the fight.

France first deployed forces in 2012 to counter Islamic insurgency that had assailed much Mali’s north.

Since then the operation has been expanded to Mauritania, Burkina Faso, Niger and Chad, tasked with building up a homegrown G5 Sahel force capable of fighting the jihadists on its own.

Prominent U.S. lawmakers such as Republican Lindsey Graham have urged Trump to uphold the Africa missions, warning of the risk of increased terror attacks in the Sahel and beyond.

“As Florence Parly reiterated during her recent Sahel visit, we have to make sure a strategic rebalancing doesn’t hamper our efforts in the Sahel,” French army chief of staff spokesman Colonel Frederic Barbry said last week.

But critics say local forces remain woefully outmatched by insurgents who have staged increasingly brazen and deadly attacks in recent months.

They also point to a long history of corruption and authoritarian rule in the region, which has corroded faith in local governments while sapping public support for France’s military engagement.

Pressure has also mounted on Paris since 13 soldiers were killed in a helicopter collision while pursuing jihadist fighters in Mali last month, the deadliest toll for France’s military in nearly four decades.

Macron Calls for ‘Real European Army’ to Protect EU from U.S. https://t.co/IvAUcuY9RU — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 6, 2018

Parly is also expected to discuss the future of the U.S.-led coalition based in Iraq amid strained relations following the U.S. drone strike thate killed top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad.

Paris insists the coalition must continue battling jihadist forces in nearby Syria to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State group, which has claimed responsibility for a wave of terror attacks on French soil since 2015.

France worries that captured foreign fighters held in Syria will escape if the coalition curtails its operations.

On Friday, thousands of Iraqis rallied in Baghdad to demand the ouster of U.S. troops from the country, though Trump and Iraqi counterpart Barham Saleh agreed in Davos on the need for a continued U.S. military role.

366,Nigeria: Christians Accuse Government of Collusion with Boko Haram,['Ben Kew'],"The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) demanded answers from the Nigerian government on Thursday after the beheading of pastor Reverend Lawan Andimi by Islamist terror group Boko Haram.

Andimi was abducted earlier this month by Boko Haram militants who attacked the local government area of Michika, where he served as the chairman of the local chapter of the CAN. Days later, he appeared in a ransom video pleading with church and government leaders to pay the necessary ransom for his release.

In the footage, he said that he had not been treated badly by his Islamic captors and that “all conditions that one finds himself is in the hand of God.”

“By the grace of God, I will be together with my wife and my children and all my colleagues,” he said. “If the opportunity has not been granted, maybe it is the will of God.”

However, he was executed by beheading on Monday after his followers failed to raise sufficient money to meet the ransom demands and because he refused to renounce his Christian faith.

In a statement released by the CAN’s Director of Legal and Public Affairs, Kwamkur Samuel Vondip, the organization blamed his death on the failure of the Nigerian government and its military to defeat Boko Haram and protect Christians against persecution, despite them repeatedly claiming to have done so.

“We recall sadly that Late Rev. Lawan Andimi while in captivity made a passionate appeal to the leadership of his church and the federal government to come to his rescue,” the statement reads, before continuing:

The church did everything within her reach to secure the safe release of this pastor gentleman but it was not possible because they didn’t have the military power to do so. The church views the unabated kidnappings, extortions and killings of Christians and innocent Nigerians as shameful to the government that each time boasts that it has conquered insurgency. It is reprehensible and saddening that each time the government comes out to claim the defeat of the insurgency, more killings of our people are committed.

The organization went on to accuse the government of Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari of “colluding” with the Islamic militants:

The very questionable leadership of the security sector that has been skewed toward a religion and region. Is that lopsidedness not a cover-up for the operation of the insurgency? If not, why couldn’t the well-equipped security agents of Nigeria get this man killed rescued? Maintenance of security is the least responsibility of any government that knows its worth. We are once again calling on President Buhari to purge himself of the allegations of nepotism and religious favoritism by reconstituting the leadership of security outfits.

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari condemned his murder, describing it as “cruel, inhuman and deliberately provocative.”

“I am greatly saddened by the fact that the terrorists went on to kill him even while giving signals of a willingness to set him free by releasing him to third parties,” he wrote. “This barbarism is condemnable. We will ensure that these terrorists pay a heavy price for their evil actions.”

Although nearly half of Nigeria’s population of 191 million identifies as Christian, the country remains one of the most dangerous places in the world to exercise religious freedom. Last year alone, at least 1,000 Christians were killed, mainly at the hands of Boko Haram and other Islamic militias.

367,China’s ‘Belt and Road’ Connects Africa to Deadly Virus,['Frances Martel'],"China’s years-long expansion into Africa – and the corresponding flood of Chinese workers establishing themselves there – has left the continent particularly vulnerable to the spread of a new iteration of coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China.

As part of China’s international “Belt and Road Initiative,” the Communist Party has signed deals worth billions of dollars with some of the continent’s largest countries, such as Nigeria and Kenya, and some of its least stable, such as Zimbabwe and Uganda. China established its first overseas permanent military base in Djibouti, on the other side of the mouth of the Red Sea from Yemen, in 2017. In Rwanda, Chinese workers have set up camp to build the Standard Gauge Railway, an expensive international project that Beijing promised would connect Rwanda’s capital to Kenya and Uganda.

Facing a lack of trustworthy healthcare infrastructure, prior cases of Chinese citizens evading local immigration authorities, and simmering indigenous outbreaks, the potential arrival of the Wuhan virus presents a disastrous possibility for China’s African business partners.

Chinese medical experts confirmed on Monday that they had identified the mystery virus as a type of coronavirus, the same type of virus responsible for the 2003 Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak that killed nearly 800 people. A team of Chinese scientists posited that the source of the virus may be local snake meat, corresponding to Communist Party claims that the virus likely jumped from animal to human at a popular wild game and seafood market in Wuhan.

Wuhan is a city of 11 million in the heart of central China. Chinese authorities have placed it on lockdown along with four other cities in the area, isolating an estimated 20 million people by shutting down flights, public transportation, and inspecting private vehicles.

Reports estimate that the virus first began to affect people in December, placing the Chinese regime’s moves to contain it about a month later than when residents were first exposed. The result has been a significant dissemination of the virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) placed the number of infected people at 584 during a press conference Thursday and stated that 575 of these were in China, though the WHO falsely includes the nation of Taiwan and autonomous regions such as Hong Kong in its definition of “China.” A total of 17 people have died at press time, all within “China.”

Outside of China, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, the United States, Taiwan, Macau, and Hong Kong have all confirmed cases of coronavirus.

While the virus has not yet hit Africa, some of the nations with the closest ties to Beijing have issued health alerts for their residents.

“The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is currently coordinating a multisectoral technical group that is assessing and managing the risk of importation to Nigeria,” the top health agency in the country said in a press alert this week. “The Port Health Services unit of the Federal Ministry of Health in Nigeria has been placed on alert and has heightened screening measures at the points of entry.”

“Nigerians are advised to remain calm. Travelers from Nigeria to Wuhan, China, are advised to avoid contact with sick people, animals (alive or dead), and animal markets,” the advisory note suggested. “Travelers from Wuhan to Nigeria, may be asked questions upon arrival by the Port Health Services unit at points of entry about symptoms of illness and travel history, and are advised to report immediately to NCDC, if they feel ill after a trip to Wuhan.”

Kenyan officials similarly set up heightened security alerts, according to Kenya’s the Nation.

“All passengers entering Kenya from China will undergo thorough screening for a new flu-like virus before being allowed into the country, the Ministry of Health has said,” the newspaper reported on Wednesday.

South Africa’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases also published an alert and assurance that it had briefed the nation’s doctors and medical staff on the currently available information on the virus. Local media also reported that points of entry to the country had increased security checks on individuals entering the country from Asia, though it remains unclear if that extends to individuals who had connecting flights outside of Asia but originally traveled from China.

China has significantly expanded its diplomatic and business footprint in Africa since the time of the SARS outbreak in 2003, when South Africa identified one carrier of the disease, the only one in the continent. The Belt and Road Initiative has entangled nearly every developing economy in Africa. China has signed deals with Nigeria, Kenya, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, and others to develop lucrative infrastructure projects – many of them railways to connect cities – in which those countries take out predatory loans to pay for the project, then use that money to pay imported Chinese workers.

“Africa is increasingly tied into the Chinese orbit that advocates for a new international order and a community of common destiny,” Yun Sun, co-director of the East Asia program and director of the China program at the Stimson Center think tank, told Congress in 2018. “China’s economic statecraft in Africa has become one of the most prioritized and effective instruments in China’s challenge to the current international order.”

More recently, Zimbabwe signed deals with China that granted it $58 million in investment grants for alleged development.

The deals have alarmed many observers in Africa who see their fate increasingly tied to the authoritarian Communist Party. China has exacerbated tensions by using its technology arms to sell surveillance technology to African dictators and sending business representatives and workers that practice overt racism in front of African partners.

Kenyan workers on the Standard Gauge Railway have complained that the Chinese bosses overseeing the construction keep segregated facilities, refusing to eat in the same lunch areas as African workers or use the same vehicles to get to work sites. The Chinese government also refuses to print instructions for the railway construction in English or other local languages and instead only prints them in Chinese, guaranteeing that the Kenyan government will not have the ability to maintain the railway without Chinese supervision and help.

In one particularly egregious instance of racism, a Chinese businessman was deported from the country after calling all Kenyans and President Uhuru Kenyatta “monkey people” on video.

These close ties to China have caused alarm.

Kenya is at high risk of an outbreak caused by a new virus lurking in China, if travel inflows from the Asian country are anything to go by. The coronavirus has put the world on high alert with countries increasing fever checks at airports amid fears of a bigger outbreak,” the Agence France-Presse (AFP) noted on Tuesday. “Government statistics show that the number of international visitors through all points of entry in 2019 shot up to 2,048,834 compared to 2018, when arrivals were 2,025,206.”

Kenya also has the dubious distinction of being home to Africa’s most prominent immigration mess caused by China. In 2018, the Standard, a Kenyan newspaper, revealed that thousands of Chinese workers were illegally using tourist visas to enter the country and take Standard Gauge Railway jobs – which China had promised Nairobi – from Kenyans.

“Insiders said besides the official numbers that have applied for work permits, there are hundreds of others behind the walls working using tourist visas who fly back home every six months for a short break, before jetting back in to pick up where they left,” the newspaper noted.

The track record of Chinese nationals evading the Kenyan immigration system suggests it is possible for many to avoid screening for coronavirus in the future.

368,Zimbabwe Signs Currency Deal with China to Help Lift Failing Economy,['Ben Kew'],"Socialist Emmerson Mnangagwa’s regime in Zimbabwe signed a currency deal with China this week in a bid to stabilize its struggling economy and improve trade links around the world.

Under the new deal, Chinese investors will be able to pay Chinese-owned businesses in Zimbabwe looking for foreign exchange. Those businesses will then release the Zimbabwe dollar equivalent of the U.S. dollar to a local bank account of the payer in China.

The deal was announced by Zimbabwean Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube on Monday, who argued it would protect foreign investors from the country’s high rate of inflation.

“What this means is that there are those who will be investing in Zimbabwe from China,” he said. “Those who require their proceeds to be remitted back to China can now do so.”

Ncube added that the deal would consequently encourage Chinese investors to continue investing in Zimbabwe. “The idea is that those individuals will then swap currency so that those who are investing in Zimbabwe are able to give them a domestic currency and they use the foreign currency, which they are bringing in for investment, to pay those who are exiting,” he said.

The arrangement is further evidence that President Emmerson Mnangagwa will look to Beijing rather than the U.S. or Europe for financial support that will ease the pressure of Zimbabwe’s economic and humanitarian crisis. Last month, a report from the United Nations concluded that the country was on the brink of “man-made starvation” as a result of rising unemployment, rampant corruption, hyperinflation, and general government mismanagement.

Under the rule of Mnangagwa’s predecessor, the late dictator Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe pursued a policy known as “Look East” that sought to build economic and diplomatic relationships with countries such as China to avoid economic sanctions over his regime’s egregious human rights violations.

As it has done in many parts of Africa, China has readily accepted the opportunity to invest in Zimbabwe as part of its “Belt and Road Initiative,” a global development strategy adopted by China in 2013 aimed at extending Beijing’s influence across the globe. A number of Chinese infrastructure projects are currently taking place in and around the capital of Harare, including the construction of a multi-million-dollar parliament building and the expansion of the city’s airport.

Zimbabwe has often proved to be a place of frustration for many Chinese investors because of the government’s failure to regularly meet its debt payments as well as difficulties in repatriating profits because of constantly rising inflation. However, China generally remains more than happy to allow countries to fall into debt traps because when countries such as Zimbabwe fail to meet payments, China can sweep up the collateral, allowing the communist regime to increase its economic and potential military influence around the world.

369,Kenya Seeks $350 Million U.S. Aid While Cashing in on China Links,['Ben Kew'],"The head of a special U.S. development program will visit Kenya this week to hold initial talks over the possibility of providing $350 million towards a major infrastructure project, local media reported on Monday.

The CEO of the U.S. sponsored Millennium Development Corporation (MCC), Sean Cairncross, said in a press briefing last week that Kenya is making “excellent progress” toward meeting necessary criteria for the funding.

Criteria for funding largely revolves around having low levels of corruption, a test that Kenya has failed for the past decade. However, the MCC last month approved Kenya for its first “threshold program,” entitling it to funding of between $20 million and $30 million in order to step up their crackdown on graft.

“Kenya must make additional progress in controlling corruption before it can be deemed eligible for an MCC compact,” said Cairncross. “The country’s standing in that regard is determined by assessments on the part of the World Bank and other third-party data sources.”

Successfully cracking down on corruption would then allow Kenya access to a “compact arrangement with the MCC,” described as which normally involves a grant of up to $350 million in funding for infrastructure projects.

“Corruption does not have to be eradicated in order for Kenya to qualify for an MCC compact,” he explained. “Eligibility is assessed on the basis of a trend toward dealing with that corruption and a willingness to engage government resources and political will to take those issues on.”

The MCC, founded by Congress in 2004, states its mission as forming “partnerships with developing countries who are committed to good governance, economic freedom and investing in their citizens.” Since its inception, the organization has handed out around $8 billion worth of grants to 25 developing countries, 13 of which are in Africa.

It will not be the first time that Kenya has been the recipient of an MCC grant. In 2007, the country entered into a program aimed at improving its public procurement systems, health services and delivery, and monitoring capabilities for collecting data. However, its record on corruption has repeatedly excluded them from further grants.

The MCC’s involvement follows years of Kenyan government officials attempting to get closer to and cash in on communist China. In October, China announced the second phase of its $5 billion Standard Gauge Railway project, intended to connect Kenya to Rwanda and Uganda. Workers on the project have repeatedly complained of being forced to operate under a system of “apartheid” racism by their Chinese supervisors – forced to eat lunch separately, take separate transport to construction sites, and prohibited from using Mandarin language instruction manuals.

In 2018, authorities deported a Chinese motorcycle dealer caught on tape referring to one of his workers, and Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, as “monkeys.”

Described by the Council of Foreign Relations as the “most ambitious infrastructure investment in history,” the Belt and Road Initiative is a global development strategy adopted by the communist regime in 2013 aimed at extending Chinese influence across the globe. Part of this strategy involves connecting China with Africa and Europe via land and maritime networks and is expected to require more than $1 trillion in investments by its completion in 2049.

Last year, the Kenyan government was forced to ask the World Bank for a $740 million loan to help meet debt payments estimated at around $50.4 billion, most of which is owed to China. When countries such as Kenya fail to meet payments, China can take over the collateral, increasing its economic and potential military influence around the world.

370,"Nigerian Rights Group Asks Pope, Trump, to Stop Christian Genocide",['Thomas D. Williams'],"The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) is appealing to President Trump and Pope Francis to intercede with their government to stop the “genocidal killings of Christians.”

Spokesmen for the rights group said they had made this decision after the recent spate of well-coordinated attacks on Christians by armed Islamists in Kaduna state.

The group’s leaders hope that as respected world leaders, Mr. Trump and Pope Francis will prevail upon Kaduna state governor Mallam Nassir El-Rufai and Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari to finally take action against the genocide.

“Since Nigerian State and the Kaduna state government are not treating these threats as a national emergency we have decided to let the world know the true state of things and we are happy that some organizations have made similar findings,” said a statement jointly signed by the HURIWA National Coordinator Emmanuel Onwubiko and National Media Affairs Director, Zainab Yusuf.

“On the last count virtually all major Christian denominations in Kaduna State have witnessed dozens of attacks just as dozens of pastors have died in the cause of these targeted armed invasions and kidnapping,” the statement reads. “We are not accusing the Kaduna state government of involvements but we are worried about the conspiratorial silence to these series of attacks.”

The rights group also expressed its deep concern that Christians are not represented in Kaduna state government, since the governor, deputy governor, and State House of Assembly speaker are all Muslims, despite constitutional provisions that members from different ethno-religious communities be represented in strategic offices.

Such a state of affairs is no accident, the group alleges, but rather “the Kaduna state government and the office of the Nigerian President are deeply entrenched in the selective appointments of mostly Moslems as holders of virtually all strategic positions.”

The effect of this is to consign “millions of Christians to the inglorious position of second-class citizens,” the statement said, making them “cannon fodder for the spiraling armed attacks by armed Islamists masquerading as herdsmen, kidnappers and bandits.”

“This is the fuel that has ignited widespread mistreatment of Christians,” the group asserts. “The incessant attacks by armed Islamists targeting only pastors; Christian schools and clerics of Christian denomination have become a national emergency.”

The exclusive Muslim composition of key government offices has contributed decisively to political inaction in the face of mounting attacks on Christians, the group stated, referencing the recent abduction of four Catholic seminarians from Good Shepherd Seminary in Kaduna.

HURIWA has compared the current situation of Christians in Nigeria to that of Iraq prior to the Islamic State’s invasion.

At that stage, “Christians were being abducted, robbed and murdered because there was no protection by the state,” the group said. “This must not be allowed to happen to the Christians of Nigeria. The government must act now, before it is too late.”

371,Nina Shea: Africa’s Christians in Islamist ‘Crosshairs’,['Thomas D. Williams'],"The Islamist campaign to eliminate Christians in sub-Saharan Africa is even “more brutal” than similar projects in the Middle East, according to recent reports.

Writing for the National Catholic Register, Nina Shea, director of the Hudson Institute’s Center for Religious Freedom, said this weekend that a “growing number of these African countries are seeing the rise of ISIS- and al-Qaida affiliates, and non-state terrorists like them, who specifically target Christians in their quest to establish Islamist rule.”

As Breitbart News reported, just last week armed Muslim Fulani militants raided a Christian village in central Nigeria, killing 13 and wounding three more, as part of an ongoing crusade to rid the country’s Middle Belt of non-Muslims.

In a separate attack, gunmen stormed the Good Shepherd Catholic Major Seminary this week, abducting four students, in Kaduna State, central Nigeria.

These attacks are occurring just as for the first time, Africa has become the continent with the most Christians, numbering 631 million, surpassing even Latin America, Ms. Shea wrote.

The meteoric growth of Christianity in Africa “is imperiled by a fast-growing and violently intolerant Islamist trend,” Shea writes, and yet and “the plight of these persecuted Christians has received far too little attention from the Western governments, NGOs and the media.”

According to a recent Wall Street Journal report, Islamist Fulani raiders are waging a brutal war on Nigeria’s Christians, and yet western media are turning a blind eye to the crisis.

When they do bother reporting on the slaughter of Christians, mainstream media usually describe them as ethnically or economically motivated, wrote Bernard-Henri Lévy, which is patently false, the work of “professional disinformers.”

Fulani extremists now pose a greater threat than the Islamic terror group Boko Haram, Lévy stated, and carry out systematic jihadist attacks involving burning, raping, maiming, pillaging, and killing.

“They are Islamic extremists of a new stripe,” said a Nigerian NGO director interviewed by Lévy, “more or less linked with Boko Haram.”

This “slow-motion war” against Nigeria’s Christians is “massive in scale and horrific in brutality,” wrote Lévy, and yet “the world has hardly noticed.”

As Ms. Shea noted in her recent essay, religious hostility against Christians has been most notorious in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country.

“Over the last decade, more Christians have been deliberately murdered by Islamic extremists in Nigeria’s northern and central belts than in all the Middle East combined,” she observed.

Boko Haram was “notably active” during the past Christmas season, Shea wrote, and the day after Christmas, the group’s ISIS faction released a film showing “black-clad militants beheading 10 blindfolded Christian men and shooting another said to be a Muslim.”

“This message is to the Christians in the world,” the voice-over to the video said. “Those who you see in front of us are Christians, and we will shed their blood as revenge for the two dignified sheikhs,” in reference to Bakr al-Baghdadi and his spokesman.

Nonetheless, in Nigeria’s Middle Belt, “it is the Fulani who are waging a religious cleansing campaign against the Christians,” Shea agrees. “The Fulani are a massive nomadic tribe, spanning parts of several countries, that have an Islamic-extremist component. They typically kill with their machetes and burn churches, along with Christian homes, though, increasingly, they come by motorcycles and vehicles, equipped with AKs.”

In the Middle East, Islamist persecution of Christians has been devastating, resulting in the eradication of some 90 percent of Iraq’s ancient Christian population and up to 50 percent of Syria’s, a situation the U.S. government designated as “genocide.”

“The question is pressing: Will the youngest Christian community, in Africa, meet the same fate, under the same pressures, as the oldest Christian community, in the Middle East?” Shea asks.

374,Malaysian Leaders Suspected Pilot Murder-Suicide in MH370 Loss,['Simon Kent'],"The “top levels” of the Malaysian government long suspected the disappearance of a plane almost six years ago was a mass murder-suicide by the pilot, former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said.

Abbott was prime minister when Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 carrying 239 people disappeared somewhere in the vastness of the Indian Ocean on March 8, 2014, while en-route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

Australia coordinated what became the largest search in aviation history, but it failed to find the plane before being ended in 2017. It remains one of the greatest aviation mysteries and has sparked numerous theories around its loss.

Speaking in a Sky News documentary to air on Wednesday and Thursday, Abbott said high-ranking Malaysian officials believed veteran pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah deliberately downed the jet in an act of murder-suicide.

Publicly, the Malaysian government’s investigation remained inconclusive, but privately, Abbott claimed those at the top knew the true explanation within a week of its disappearance, but he fears search teams were never informed.

“My very clear understanding, from the very top levels of the Malaysian government is that from very, very early on, they thought it was murder-suicide by the pilot,” said Abbott, who was Australia’s leader from 2013-15.

“I’m not going to say who said what to whom, but let me reiterate, I want to be absolutely crystal clear, it was understood at the highest levels that this was almost certainly murder-suicide by the pilot.”

﻿

Malaysian investigators publicly gave Captain Shah the all-clear, and were searching areas they believed a “ghost plane” – which continues flying without anyone able to control it – could have reached before running out of fuel and falling back to earth.

The search following the plane’s possible trajectory was based on the understanding the pilots were dead – or somehow incapacitated – before the plane fell into the sea.

The Australian-led search scoured 46,000 square miles of the southern Indian Ocean and cost $200 million. A private hunt by Texas-based company Ocean Infinity later searched more than 37,000 square miles of open ocean.

Debris that washed ashore in the western Indian Ocean has been confirmed as coming from the missing Boeing 777 and indicated a broad expanse of the ocean where the plane likely crashed after running out of fuel.

Australia, Malaysia and China agreed in 2016 that an official search would only resume if the three countries had credible evidence that identified a specific location for the wreckage. Most of the passengers were Chinese.

Abbott maintains a new investigation is warranted.

“Let’s assume that it was murder-suicide by the pilot and if there is any part of that ocean that could have been reached on that basis that has not yet been explored, let’s get out and explore it,” he said.

375,Hong Kong Protesters Denounce Quarantine Plans,['John Hayward'],"Angry protesters took to the streets of Hong Kong over the weekend to denounce government plans for coronavirus quarantine facilities, arguing that treatment centers should be kept far away from residential neighborhoods, and would be unnecessary if their government properly restricted travel from China.

Radio Free Asia reported riot police confronting demonstrators on Saturday who used stray junk and rubbish to barricade highways, vandalized railroad ticket machines, and threw garbage onto rail lines. Vandalism was also reported at clinics that have been designated for treating “mild” cases of the coronavirus.

Hundreds of people participated in earlier peaceful demonstrations that called on Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam to close the border with China. Lam has imposed some travel restrictions, but has resisted demands to completely block travel to and from China for the duration of the epidemic.

Coconuts Hong Kong reported more protests on Sunday:

Demonstrators in Kwai Chung, Cheung Sha Wan, Sai Kung, Fo Tan, and Kowloon Bay gathered to demand authorities place any quarantine facilities far away from residential districts, despite acknowledging the need for extra facilities as the number of suspected cases continues to rise. So far, Hong Kong has recorded 58 confirmed coronavirus cases, one of them fatal. In Kwai Chung, hundreds marched in opposition to plans to use the South Kwai Chung Jockey Club general outpatient clinic as one of 18 designated clinics for treating suspected COIVD-19 patients showing mild symptoms. The rally, which was approved beforehand, was led by district councillors and Democratic Party lawmaker Andrew Wan Siu-kin, with Kwai Tsing district councillor Ng Kim-sing saying the government should instead consider setting up a temporary clinic in the abandoned Kwai Chung Public School nearby.

Opposition lawmaker Claudia Mo spoke at the rally, describing Lam’s coronavirus plans as “setting a fire and extinguishing a fire at the same time.”

“Some ask, if residents keep opposing the use of certain sites for quarantine purposes, where else can the government seek extra facilities? But the root cause of the problem is the government is reluctant to entirely close the remaining borders,” Mo said, addressing criticism of the protesters for damaging or blocking access to designated coronavirus clinics.

At another rally, speakers criticized the Hong Kong government for acting furtively and issuing contradictory statements about its policies, effectively accusing Lam and her officials of verbally conceding to public outrage, but then proceeding with their quarantine plans anyway.

Government officials countered by saying coronavirus patients must be treated somewhere, including hundreds expected to soon be recovered from a cruise ship currently under lockdown in Japan, and if special clinics cannot be established to treat those suffering from the coronavirus, they will end up mixing with the general population of hospitals and spreading the disease further.

The Hong Kong public is growing more nervous as supplies run short, in some cases because coronavirus panic buying has cleaned out the stores. Some of the most acute shortages concern protective gear such as face masks, which were already popular both for disease prevention and keeping protesters anonymous from the authorities before the Wuhan epidemic began.

The Hong Kong Free Press reported on Sunday that thousands of street cleaners are struggling to find masks as a critical shortage looms and supervisors warn free masks will no longer be provided. There are fears the street cleaners will go on strike due to the mask shortage, which would make the city “filthy” and create even more health issues. Lam announced on Saturday that 700,000 masks will be distributed to street cleaners, but she did not specify when or how they will be passed out.

Hong Kong confirmed its 60th case of the coronavirus on Monday. Five members of the Hospital Authority were placed under medical surveillance after two engineers they came in brief contact with were diagnosed with the Wuhan virus. The engineers appear to have contracted the disease in Hong Kong, as they have not traveled overseas recently, and one of them has a wife who is also infected.",https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/02/17/hong-kong-protesters-denounce-quarantine-plans-block-streets-rail-lines/
376,Coronavirus: Nearly 80% of American Factories in Shanghai Say They Lack Workers,['John Carney'],"American factories in China are warning that they do not have enough staff to get their production lines fully back online as plants re-open after the extended coronavirus shutdown.

Nearly 80 percent of U.S. businesses in the Shanghai area say they lack the manpower to run at full speed, according to the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. Forty-one percent said their biggest challenge in the next two to four weeks will be a lack of workers. Thirty percent said logistics issues will be their biggest concern.

The lack of staff raising the prospects of disruptions to global supply chains. The economic fallout from the coronavirus could include hits to production in regions, including the U.S., where the virus itself has been scarce but which are dependent on Chinese inputs for goods. China is one of the top three suppliers, alongside Canada and Mexico, of intermediate goods that go into final products produced in the U.S. It is likely the largest supplier of intermediate goods to the U.S. economy counting its exports to third countries that produce final goods sold in the U.S.

377,China: America Is an ‘Empire of Hackers’,['John Hayward'],"Chinese Foreign Minister Geng Shuang held a press conference on Monday in which he accused the United States of being the world’s worst sponsor of cybercrimes.

The outburst came in response to the latest U.S. criminal court filings against Chinese cyber-espionage operations, notably including the massive Equifax hack of 2017.

As China has done incessantly over the past decade, Geng cited the information disclosed by rogue National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. He also cited a more recent story from the Washington Post and German public broadcast network ZDF about the CIA and West German intelligence secretly owning a Swiss company called Crypto AG that sold encryption devices to governments around the world.

According to CIA documents leaked by unidentified sources to the Washington Post, the CIA, NSA, and their West German partners secretly controlled Crypto AG for decades, installing back doors in its technology so they could monitor such ostensibly secure communications as the Iranian revolutionary government discussing the 1979 hostage crisis, Argentina’s military communications during the 1982 Falklands War, and Libyan officials celebrating the 1986 bombing of a disco in Berlin.

The CIA report called it “the intelligence coup of the century.” Although its relevance to secure communications began falling off in the 1990s, at its peak Crypto was handling about 40 percent of all diplomatic cables and other secure government transmissions worldwide, and the operation generated substantial monetary profits for the CIA and West Germany’s BND agency in addition to the intel windfall.

U.S. and German intelligence officials declined to comment on the Washington Post / ZDF report, although the Post noted they did not dispute the authenticity of the documents.

The Chinese foreign minister was not impressed by the roster of very bad people the CIA was allegedly able to monitor through its Crypto AG program, as reported by China’s state-run Xinhua news service:

Geng told an online press briefing that the U.S. government and relevant departments have conducted large-scale, organized and indiscriminate cyber theft, surveillance and espionage on foreign governments, businesses and individuals, which is “a fact already well-known to all.” It is a tawdry trick that the United States, on the one hand, has been collecting nearly 5 billion mobile phone call records across the globe every day, spying over German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cell phone for more than 10 years, controlling more than 3 million computers in China every year, and implanting Trojan Horse in more than 3,600 websites in China, and on the other hand, enjoys playing victim of cyber attack, just like a thief crying “stop thief,” said Geng. The U.S. hypocrisy on the issue of cybersecurity could not be clearer, the spokesman said, stressing that the U.S. has no honor and credibility to speak of in front of other countries. “Facts have proven once again that as the largest state actor of spying in cyberspace, the U.S. is worthy of the name of the ’empire of hackers.’ The sky is the limit with the U.S. when it comes to spying,” said Geng.

Geng apparently did not mention the part of the Washington Post article that compared the Crypto AG operation to modern companies suspected of links to intelligence agencies, “including the Russian anti-virus firm Kaspersky, a texting app tied to the United Arab Emirates and the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei.”

Wired impishly turned that comparison around and speculated the U.S. government is worried about Chinese intelligence using Huawei technology for espionage because Crypto AG taught American intelligence officials just how damaging backdoors into encryption systems could be.

“Every organization should understand and accept that they can’t fully audit the encryption code on the devices they use to secure their data, and there’s a history of potential hardware tampering by government agencies around the world. So organizations need to choose equipment that, if backdoored, presents the least risk. Supply chain security is a bear,” former NSA analyst Jake Williams told Wired.

The BBC reported on Sunday that the Crypto story was a bombshell in Switzerland, since it shakes the country’s famed reputation for international neutrality.

“A federal judge is already on the case and politicians across the spectrum are calling for a parliamentary commission of inquiry,” the BBC said.",https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/02/18/china-america-empire-hackers/
378,Armed Gang Steals Toilet Paper amid Hong Kong Coronavirus Panic,['John Hayward'],"Hong Kong police are on the lookout for armed gangsters who held up a truck on Monday morning and stole about $130 worth of toilet paper – a precious commodity in a time of coronavirus panic and chronic shortages at grocery stores.

The Hong Kong Free Press (HKFP) reported the three toilet paper thieves were armed with knives. The robbery took place in a district noted for triad gang activity.

In the aftermath of the crime, HKFP noted television footage of police investigators standing guard around pallets of toilet paper, either because the shipment is considered evidence of the crime or because they are worried about more thieves attempting to steal it.

Reuters reported 50 rolls of toilet paper were carried off in the heist. Police quickly caught up with two of the three thieves, but the third is still on the loose.

“Authorities have blamed false online rumours for the panic-buying and say supplies of food and household goods remain stable, but the panic-buying has itself created shortages in one of the world’s most densely populated cities where supermarkets and pharmacies have limited floor space,” HKFP wrote.

Hong Kong protesters returned to the streets over the weekend, angry at what they said were insufficient measures by their pro-Beijing government to protect the semi-autonomous city from the epidemic. On Saturday protesters occupied and barricaded several streets, set fire to a railroad station, attempted to block a railroad track, and damaged clinics that have been designated for handling coronavirus patients.

Hong Kong officials said on Sunday they will charter an airplane to return about 350 residents who are currently trapped aboard the Diamond Princess, the cruise ship quarantined in Japan with a steadily mounting number of virus cases detected on board. Officials said the flights would be arranged “free of charge soonest possible after they are permitted to disembark and land.”",https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/02/17/armed-gang-steals-toilet-paper-hong-kong-coronavirus-panic/
379,China Mulls Canceling Thousands-Strong Annual Lawmaking Session,['Frances Martel'],"China’s year-round legislature will meet next week to discuss postponing the annual session convening every lawmaker in the “National People’s Congress” (NPC), a body that typically approves laws already decided by senior Communist Party officials.

Members of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), a large committee of prominent Chinese celebrities and businesspeople that offers advice to the NPC, are also considering delaying their meeting, scheduled for March. Rescheduling the meeting would reveal significant fears amid high-level Communist Party officials that the ongoing coronavirus outbreak in the country will take more than a month to control. In January, state propaganda outlets claimed that evidence suggested the outbreak was already waning.

The “two sessions” – the Communist Party’s largest political gathering and a major event Beijing uses to deceive the world into thinking of it as a democracy – normally convene thousands of people, making it the kind of large assembly that poses a significant public health threat.

The Communist Party alerted the world to its discovery of a never-before-seen form of coronavirus on January 20, originating in the central Chinese metropolis of Wuhan. It has since infected over 70,000 people on four continents and killed over 1,000. The outbreak was likely made worse by communist officials hiding its existence between mid-December, when locals first reported becoming aware of a disease spreading, to the date in which the World Health Organization (WHO) spread China’s warning that the virus had been identified. During those days, officials in Wuhan allowed several large public gatherings, including a banquet feeding 130,000 people, mostly seniors.

Xinhua, a Chinese government news agency, reported on Monday that the Standing Committee – the part of the legislature that convenes year-round, as opposed to the nearly 3,000 people that make up the entire NPC – will meet “in late February” to discuss changing the dates of the currently scheduled full session.

According to the report, NPC officials are considering canceling the event not because a delegate may spread coronavirus among Communist Party officials, but because many of the delegates invited also hold positions in local government and their absence may delay the government’s response in affected communities. About a third of NPC members also hold local positions.

“Many of the nearly 3,000 NPC deputies, including leading officials at the municipal, provincial levels and other fields, are fighting at the frontlines of the epidemic battle,” Xinhua noted. “After careful evaluation, the Council of Chairpersons decided that it is necessary to postpone the annual legislative session to allow efforts to be concentrated on containing the epidemic. This is in line with putting people’s lives and health as the top priority.”

Only the Standing Committee, however, can make the decision to postpone the meeting, necessitating yet another meeting to postpone the meeting.

The Global Times, China’s more belligerent English-language propaganda outlet, published an article Monday predicting that any delay in holding the “two sessions” would only push them later into March, apparently responding to concerns that the delay indicates Beijing has little faith in Party members to swiftly contain the virus.

“The proposal to delay indicates that the central government puts epidemic prevention and control work as its top priority, showing its highly responsible stance not only to the Chinese people but also to the work,” a Global Times “expert” identified as Zhuang Deshui, said in the article.

The South China Morning Post reported that the CPPCC – which last year included among its members Jackie Chan and Yao Ming – was similarly expecting to cancel its session. A source told the newspaper that, while the public reason for postponing the meetings would be not to take key local officials out of their home provinces while doing important Party work to contain the virus, the real reason was fear that the lawmakers themselves would be infected.

“The risk of cross infections would be very high for nearly 8,000 people … as well as staff responsible for administering the meetings, under the same roof of the Great Hall of the People,” the anonymous “source who is familiar with the preparations” said. “The health risk of convening the annual sessions early next month would be too high when the coronavirus outbreak has not yet been effectively contained.”

The “two sessions” are pivotal to Communist Party networking, as they bring together senior Party officials from the whole country for a typically two-week affair in Beijing. Dictator Xi Jinping’s government has attempted to excite the general public about the meetings through its propaganda wings, urging all to unite in “building a moderately prosperous society,” the stated goal of the meeting in a 2018 hip-hop song about the sessions.

“As is much anticipated, the annual Two Sessions have already opened,” the rap begins, referring to the two sessions of Congress. “So many highlights, they shouldn’t be missed!”

At press time, international health experts have documented 71,902 confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide, over 70,500 of them in China. Of these, 1,775 people have died, most within China. Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, the Philippines, and France have documented deaths among their patients.

The World Health Organization (WHO) began what Xinhua called “field inspections” in China on Monday meant to evaluate China’s response to the virus. The WHO team will not visit Wuhan or any place in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located.

380,Japan’s Sharp Contraction Sends Global Warning About Tax Hikes,['John Carney'],"The Japanese economy shrank at an annual pace of 6.3 percent last quarter after a consumption tax hike crushed consumer spending.

Domestic demand fell in the quarter at an annual pace of 8.0 percent, seasonally adjusted economic data released Monday by Japan’s Cabinet Office showed Monday.

The government hiked a consumption tax from 8 percent to 10 percent in October. The negative impact from that tax hike was much larger than expected. Retail stores have reported a decline in sales akin to that seen at the height of the 2008 financial crisis.

The figures for the final three months of 2019 were much worse than the 3.7 percent decline forecast by economists. The deep dive makes it far more likely that the economy will be in contraction again in the first quarter of 2020, meaning Japan would technically be in a recession. Most economists define a recession as two consecutive quarterly contractions.

The contraction in Japan may offer a sobering lesson for the U.S., currently experiencing its longest-ever economic expansion. All of the Democratic candidates have proposed tax hikes of various sorts, and all assume that having the government sweep more money out of the private sector would not be a drag on economic growth. While some of the tax proposals, such as a wealth tax on billionaires, would not likely have a broad effect on domestic demand, other taxes would. Several Democrats have proposed consumption taxes in the form of gasoline tax hikes and value-added taxes that would hit demand.

Japan’s gross domestic product, or GDP, the sum of the value of a nation’s products and services, slipped 1.6 percent in the last three months of 2019 quarter-on-quarter. The annualized rate shows what the drop would have been if that same pace had continued for a year.

The contraction for the October-December period was the first Japan had in more than a year. The amount of decline was the worst in about five years. The news sent the Nikkei 225 benchmark stock index falling in trading Monday.

Both exports and imports fell during the fourth quarter.

The coronavirus outbreak is likely to be a drag on the economy in the first quarter. Japan had been counting on Chinese tourists in recent years to sustain growth, but visits have dwindled to a trickle. Japanese companies have halted or adjusted production, because of supply chain disruptions or work suspensions at their own factories in China.

Overall consumption is likely to drop as people avoid crowds.

“The concerns for the export focused economy is continued pressure amid the coronavirus,” said Jingyi Pan, market strategist at IG in Singapore of Japan’s GDP.

381,Xi Jinping Demands Obedience to Battle Coronavirus,['John Hayward'],"The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on Saturday published the text of a speech dictator Xi Jinping gave to the party central committee last week that provided some insight into how the Communists are attempting to manage the political fallout from the coronavirus epidemic.

In the speech, Xi claimed he has been managing the virus response from the beginning, a rebuttal to broad public anger that he has been invisible for most of the crisis. Xi used the epidemic as leverage to demand total obedience from his subjects at a moment when popular discontent with his rule has reached an all-time high, shifting blame for the outbreak and various abuses of public trust to lower-level local officials.

China’s state-run Xinhua news service summarized key points from the speech (referred to as “the article”) on Saturday:

The article stresses the importance of securing success in the prevention and control work, pointing out that the outcome of the epidemic prevention and control directly affects people’s lives and health, the overall economic and social stability and the country’s opening-up. Resources for treatment, prevention and protection must be sent to the front line of the battle against the epidemic and priority should be given to meet the needs of frontline medical staff and patients, according to the article. All-out efforts should be made to improve the admission and survival rates, and reduce the infection and mortality rates, the article says. The article underlines the need to safeguard social stability, the promotion of public education and communication, as well as ensuring a stable economic performance. It also stresses improving the country’s emergency management system and capacity of handling urgent, difficult, dangerous and important tasks.

The state-run Global Times conjured up some “analysts” who were floored by Xi’s magnificent speech and praised his “transparent” leadership on the coronavirus, even though the big political story in China over the past two months has been Xi disappearing and leaving Premier Li Kequiang holding the virus hot potato:

Analysts noted that Xi, the leader of the Party and the country, is leading the fight against the COVID-19 in a very transparent and responsible manner, directly addressing public discontent and meeting people’s expectations. It is very rarely seen that a speech by the president at a senior-level meeting included so many details, direct instructions and harsh criticisms on the problems, especially during the fight against the virus. At the very beginning of the article, Xi noted that he has made requirements on work to prevent and control the COVID-19 on January 7 since the outbreak started while presiding a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee. Chinese experts said that the CPC Central Committee is playing the most significant role in this war on the virus which needs to mobilize a country with a 1.4 billion population.

“COVID-19” is the medical terminology for the virus. The Chinese are working very hard on getting the rest of the world to stop referring to it as the “Wuhan virus,” for obvious political reasons.

The Global Times especially liked the part of Xi’s speech where he demanded even greater levels of obedience from all quarters of Chinese government and society, blaming any perceived deficiencies in China’s virus response on clumsy local officials who did not follow Beijing’s orders quickly and completely:

The article noted that “Party committees and governments at all levels must firmly obey the centralized leadership of the CPC Central Committee,” epidemic prevention and control is not an issue only related to medical care, but works of all aspects. It is a comprehensive war, and all effort must lend support to winning this battle in preventing and controlling the epidemic. The implementation of the CPC Central Committee’s instructions at all levels is generally good, the article noted, but also stressed the need to strengthen areas of weakness and close loopholes exposed by the current epidemic. Shen Yi, head of Fudan University’s Cyberspace Governance Research Institute, said that the article shows an honest and transparent attitude, as a very serious problem that was exposed since the beginning of the outbreak is that “a few officials at local level governments didn’t effectively implement the instructions from the CPC Central Committee and also didn’t reflect the real situation at the time.” “The CPC Central Committee is aware of a situation on January 7, but due to this kind of problem (inefficient implementation), it caused some loopholes and mistakes, and fortunately the Party has a strong capability of self-correction, and now the damage over the credibility of the government has been generally fixed and recovered,” Song said.

CNN suspected the “situation on January 7” described in the new Communist Party virus mythology was a reference to the massive banquet that was regrettably held in Wuhan just as the virus was exploding out of control. The first two weeks of January were a particularly grim chapter in the tale of the coronavirus, as it represented the last efforts of Chinese officials to pretend the situation was completely under control and the virus was not particularly dangerous.

Under gale-force political spin pumped out by Xinhua and the Global Times, the new story is that Xi was secretly in control the whole time, but idiotic local officials (and an equally foolish team of researchers dispatched from Beijing that claimed the virus was under control on January 11) botched Xi’s orders and misinformed him.

Ultimately, however, the awkwardness of sharing some of the blame with Hubei officials might be preferable to admitting that Xi and those around him were potentially unaware or ill-informed about what was really going on.

The Associated Press thought the new mythology made Xi and other top CCP officials vulnerable to criticism that they knew how dangerous the Wuhan virus was but did not take firm action until the epidemic was so huge that it could no longer be ignored:

The disclosure of his speech indicates top leaders knew about the outbreak’s potential severity at least two weeks before such dangers were made known to the public. It was not until late January that officials said the virus can spread between humans and public alarm began to rise. Zhang Lifan, a commentator in Beijing, said it’s not clear why the speech was published now. One message could be that local authorities should take responsibility for failing to take effective measures after Xi gave instructions in early January. Alternatively, it may mean that Xi, as the top leader, is willing to take responsibility because he was aware of the situation, Zhang said.

Bloomberg News found it “perplexing” that Xi would attempt a wholesale rewriting of coronavirus history, producing an altered timeline that most Chinese citizens know is false. Skeptics are greatly underestimating the CCP’s ability to force its citizens to believe in edited versions of history, and the ability of Communist leaders to pin blame for their shortcomings on underlings. A great many local officials will be scapegoated to make Xi’s new timeline stick, with some of them probably ending up in prison or worse, but there will be plenty of replacement officials to take their places.

On Monday, Xinhua pumped out supplementary propaganda to cover Xi’s flank, portraying the international community as dazzled by Xi’s leadership and claiming the epidemic makes China look more responsible and transparent to the world community, not less. Amusingly, Xinhua had to turn to the general secretary of the Egyptian Communist Party to get a really good fawning quote about China’s “really impressive,” “resolute,” and “decisive” measures to battle the virus.

Chinese state media on Monday claimed the Wuhan virus outbreak is coming under control, with fewer new cases reported for three consecutive days following a huge spike in new infections last week. Premier Li Kequiang said on Monday the threat of a pandemic has been “averted.”",https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/02/17/xi-jinping-demands-obedience-to-battle-coronavirus-shifts-blame-to-local-officials/
382,China ‘Punishes’ Local Officials After Coronavirus Patient Hangs Himself,['Frances Martel'],"Chinese state media revealed Sunday that four local Communist Party officials in Wuhan had been “punished” after a suspected coronavirus patient hanged himself.

Wuhan, a city of 11 million, is the epicenter of the current novel coronavirus outbreak, believed to have been triggered by locals selling and eating wild game meat at an open market. The Chinese communist regime shut the market down nearly a month before alerting the general public to the presence of a contagious disease, allowing millions to leave Wuhan for the Lunar New Year holiday and hospitals to treat coronavirus patients in the same quarters as other sensitive patients.

The result of the Communist Party’s failures has been an outbreak affecting over 70,000 people worldwide and killing over 1,000, most of them in China.

Reports have surfaced of hospitals in Wuhan turning potential coronavirus patients away, significantly limiting local health officials’ ability to track the disease but artificially deflating the number of confirmed cases in the World Health Organization (WHO)’s tally. Suppressing the real numbers can help give the impression that the outbreak is more contained and less of an emergency than it is.

Locals in Wuhan have revealed through anonymous reports that, for weeks, hospitals told walk-in patients that they only had permission to test “authorized” patients for coronavirus – that is, patients with special hospital approval, not merely patients with fever, difficulty breathing, or other visible symptoms. Those turned away were, in many cases, quarantined at home. Videos surfacing online showed Communist Party authorities bolting and welding shut the doors of families believed to have been exposed to the virus.

One of those cases of patients turned away, the state-run Global Times revealed on Monday, resulted in a suicide. The propaganda outlet identified the man only as “Cheng” and said that officials received information that the man had exhibited signs of carrying the virus, but did not offer him any medical attention.

“Cheng eventually hanged himself to death,” the Global Times noted.

The case shares similarities with a suicide in India last week. Bala Krishna, a 50-year-old farmer, fell ill and ultimately hanged himself. Unlike Cheng, however, Krishna received medical treatment and was confirmed to not be a coronavirus carrier, instead suffering from another type of viral infection that doctors insisted did not pose a threat to his neighborhood or family. Krishna insisted that he had coronavirus, threw stones at relatives who tried to get close to him, and ultimately hanged himself.

Four local officials in Wuhan “have been punished for failing to report a patient suspected to be infected with the virus in time, which resulted in the patient’s death,” the newspaper said. It later specified that the “punishment” was a “warning from the Party for knowing about Cheng’s illness but failing to take the necessary measures in time” for two of the officials. The other two “were criticized,” it added.

The Chinese government has moved first against officials whose behavior prompted deaths outside of those diagnosed with coronavirus. The first firing of multiple officials in Hubei, for example, resulted from officials quarantining an entire family except for a 16-year-old with cerebral palsy, who died as he was left alone for six days and needed round-the-clock care to survive.

“I have two disabled sons. My older son Yan Cheng has cerebral palsy. He cannot move his body, he cannot speak or look after himself. He has already been at home by himself for six days, with nobody to bathe him or change his clothes and nothing to eat or drink,” the teen’s father wrote in a social media post the government later censored.

China Daily, another government propaganda newspaper, reported on Sunday that others in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, had “been removed from office or disciplined” for similar failures in addressing the outbreak. Their cases received public repudiation through an announcement by the province’s Discipline Inspection Commission and Supervisory Commission, the Communist Party bureaucracy’s punitive agencies. While the article identified several individuals already known to have publicly lost their jobs, it revealed other cases of Communist Party officials fabricating data on the viral outbreak, “acting irresponsibly,” and working “by phone”:

Wang Gonghua, deputy director of the standing committee of the Danjiangkou people’s congress, made up work logs. Wang Xujie, chairman of the Yunxi county committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, loosely implemented quarantine rules, as did Zheng Zhongtan, deputy director of Yunxi county’s legislature, who carried out the work by phone. Two other typical cases featured local Party committees acting irresponsibly by allowing banquets and public gatherings. You Hao and Liu Yu, Party chiefs of Chunmuying and Maobei townships in Enshi Tujia and Miao autonomous prefecture, were both removed from their posts.

Allowing public events is believed to be one of the ways in which the number of coronavirus cases grew into the tens of thousands. The weekend before China alerted the world to the existence of a previously unidentified type of coronavirus originating in Wuhan, the city attempted to break the world record for largest banquet with an annual Lunar New Year feast. The event attracted about 130,000 people and was primarily targeted at older “empty nest” residents whose children could not be home for the holiday. Elderly coronavirus patients are believed to make up most of the global death toll.

Beijing-based Communist Party propaganda has also disparaged Wuhan officials for causing unnecessary trauma to coronavirus patients. Last week, the Global Times revealed a harrowing incident in which local officials attempted to transfer elderly coronavirus patients to a new hospital. They did not use a specialized hospital vehicle; a public bus driver was expected to drive a large number of elderly patients – for which the bus did not have enough seats – to the hospital without directions. Neither the driver nor the patients received any protective care and the driver got lost for hours. The Global Times documented “several emotional breakdowns” on the driver’s part alone.

Just as it has shifted all blame for the coronavirus outbreak on local officials, Beijing government media has given all praise for any positive responses to the outbreak to dictator Xi Jinping and senior Communist Party officials. Xi punished the text of a recent speech as an opinion column in state media Monday, declaring himself the leader of the outbreak response and urging full obedience to Beijing from the people, a response to growing discontent against his leadership in the country. Xinhua, the government news service, also published a story claiming the international community is praising Xi personally for his handling of the outbreak.

At press time, global health authorities have identified 71,812 confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide and 1,775 deaths, nearly all of them in China. Cases have been confirmed in Europe, Africa, and North America as well as other countries of Asia.

383,China Debut for New Bond Film ‘No Time to Die’ Axed over Coronavirus Fears,['Simon Kent'],"The latest James Bond blockbuster No Time to Die will no longer undertake a lucrative publicity tour in China as cinemas in the country remain shuttered in efforts to contain the deadly coronavirus.

The film, which marks star Daniel Craig’s last outing as the iconic spy, is still set to debut in North America on April 10.

Chinese cinemas and huge swathes of the world’s second largest economy have been shut since the country’s lunar new year holiday last month.

Daniel Craig and other key stars in the upcoming 25th Bond epic were due to travel to China for the film’s premiere, which was set for April in Beijing, the Sunday Times of London said.

But coronavirus, or COVID-19 as it is now designated, which has infected more than 69,000 people, has obliterated those plans.

More than 70,000 cinemas across China are currently closed because of the health scare, the report said, and a studio insider added that the key stars are unlikely to get clearance to travel there even if the cinemas start opening again by April.

384,"China Cries 'Discrimination', Scolds Australia for Rejecting Huawei 5G",['Simon Kent'],"Australia’s decision to join the U.S. and ban Huawei from any participation in a national 5G network remains a “sore point or thorny issue” between the two countries, the Chinese ambassador alleged Monday, adding “discrimination against a Chinese company” lies at the core of the dispute.

Cheng Jingye dismissed concerns Huawei may pose a threat to Australia’s national security given its known links to the Communist Chinese government, and said Australia’s ban was “politically motivated.”

﻿

“It is, it is,” he told local outlet Sky News. “I mean, it is a discrimination against the Chinese company. At the same time it doesn’t serve the best interest of the Australian companies and consumers …

“I mean, as far as I know the Huawei company in Australia, they have, I mean, tried in every means to talk with the Australian authorities to explore what security risks or concerns you have. And also they have pledged, I think publicly, to conclude a no-backdoor agreement.”

The telecommunications giant was banned in August 2018 from joining Australia’s 5G rollout due to security concerns. The then Turnbull conservative coalition government chose to follow the U.S. lead and say “no” to Huwai.

The U.S. has since been pressing nationsto deny Huawei access to 5G networks and alleged the company’s equipment could be used by Beijing for spying, which the Chinese firm has repeatedly denied.

In May, U.S President Donald Trump signed an executive order barring U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by companies posing a national security risk, as Breitbart News reported.

The Trump administration also added Huawei to its trade blacklist, citing national security concerns.

The question of whether Huawei’s 5G equipment could contain back doors allowing access to Chinese spying has been dividing countries in the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network, which includes the United States, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

Britain has taken a less firm line compared to other countries in the group, with U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying Huawei’s 5G products could be used in less sensitive areas.

In an exclusive Breitbart London video, Benedict Rogers, the founder of Hong Kong Watch, said that decision is “one of the worst and most unwise decisions in recent times”.

“If Boris Johnson goes ahead with allowing Huawei access to our 5G infrastructure, it is going to leave all of us open, to our data, even our basic freedoms being vulnerable to the Chinese Communist Party,” warned Rogers.

The Huawei decision by the U.K. has been widely panned in the U.S., with critics saying any deal with a company so closely tied to the Chinese Communist Party could damage trade and security agreements between Britain and America.",https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/02/17/china-cries-discrimination-scolds-australia-for-rejecting-huawei-5g-network/
385,Report: ‘Record Number of Violent Attacks Against Christians’ in India,['Thomas D. Williams'],"The number of violent attacks on Christians in India has been steadily increasing during the administration of Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Telegraph reported Sunday.

The report suggests that it is precisely “the prime minister’s Hindu nationalist agenda” that has fueled the rise in attacks on Christians manifesting a “worrying trend” of religious intolerance.

New data “shows a record number of violent attacks against Christians across the country,” the Telegraph noted.

By all accounts 2019 was a very difficult year for Christians living in India, as Breitbart News has reported, and 2020 promises to be as bad if not worse. In the first quarter of 2019, hate crimes and targeted violence against Christians in India showed a jump of 57 percent over the same period in 2018, according to report released at the time by the Religious Liberty Commission of the Evangelical Fellowship of India (EFI).

The persecution continued unabated through the year, and Indian Christians faced one of their most difficult Christmases in memory, suffering numerous acts of targeted persecution, according to a report from International Christian Concern (ICC).

The growing intolerance toward Christians severely curbed Christians’ ability to freely celebrate the Christmas holiday, ICC said, and many were forced to adjust their Christmas celebrations accordingly, due to “a fear of being attacked by Hindu radicals.”

Sunday’s Telegraph article recounts the story of Christian pastor Jai Singh, who was assaulted by a mob of some 200 Hindus chanting anti-Christian slogans in the village of Bitchpuri, which has a Christian population of some 120 souls.

The mob, instigated by members of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), an all-male paramilitary youth wing of Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), beat the pastor along with his 15-year-old son and dragged him to the village square.

“They hit me with their fists and then took me into the temple and beat me with sticks, before stretching my legs back as far as they would go,” resulting in two broken feet and permanent nerve damage to his legs, Rev. Singh told The Sunday Telegraph.

As is typical in such cases, Pastor Singh’s assailants have filed trumped-up charges against him for “attempted conversion” in an apparent attempt to silence him.

“We are living in constant fear and after hearing about the attack, many local believers renounced their faith,” Singh said.

“But for me it just made my faith stronger and I pray to God to forgive the people who attacked me,” he added.

According to the latest data, the year 2019 saw a record 328 violent attacks against Christians in India.

More than 300 Christians were detained without trial for their faith, according to the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a faith-based legal advocacy organization, while numerous businesses, homes, churches, and schools were looted, torched, or vandalized. The ADF has registered a 220 percent increase in violent attacks on Christians since 2014 when Mr. Modi came to power.

Yet while 328 violent attacks were reported to officials, only 36 of these resulted in police filing a case. Not one of the incidents has resulted in prosecution.

Indian Christians trace their history back to 52 AD, when the apostle Thomas reached their shores to evangelize those living there. Presently there are some 28 million Christians in India, who comprise 2.3 percent of the overall population.

386,Report: China Stole the Personal Data of Over 13 Million UK Citizens,['Kurt Zindulka'],"An elite hacker network sponsored by China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) stole the personal data, including telephone numbers, credit card details, and passwords, of over 13 million people in Britain.

The Chinese reportedly sponsored a 2017 cyberattack on Equifax, a top consumer credit reporting agency. It was described by the United States as the largest database hack in history, with over 145 million Americans being affected — and it has now been revealed millions in the United Kingdom were impacted as well.

Equifax said that the personal data of at least 13.1 million Britons was compromised in the hack as their data was stored on their servers in Atlanta, Georgia, according to The Times.

The hack was conducted by four members of the People’s Liberation Army’s cyber-espionage unit, dubbed the “54th Research Institute”, Wu Zhiyong, Wang Qian, Xu Ke, and Liu Lei — all of whom were indicted by the United States Justice Department on Monday.

William Barr, the Attorney General of the United States, said: “Unfortunately, the Equifax hack fits a disturbing and unacceptable pattern of state-sponsored computer intrusions and thefts by China and its citizens that have targeted personally identifiable information, trade secrets, and other confidential information.”

U.S. Charges Four Chinese Military Officers in Equifax Data Breach https://t.co/T8DjuIQPsO — Rebecca Mansour (@RAMansour) February 10, 2020

China, for its part, has denied any involvement in the hack, claiming to be a “victim” of the hack themselves.

“From the case of WikiLeaks to Edward Snowden, the U.S. hypocrisy and double standards on cybersecurity have been fully revealed,” said Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang, deflecting from the four indictments against members of the PLA.

The hackers are believed to have used a network of computers in nearly twenty countries to mask their “criminal heist” operation. It is feared by investigators that the hack will put Americans and Britons working in the defence and nuclear industries at risk, as well as providing blackmail material against politicians and intelligence agents.

The Beijing-based hacker group used Equifax’s “online dispute portal”, where consumers could challenge their credit rating, to enter the system. Three months before the cyberattack, Equifax was informed that the site was vulnerable to such a hack. However, the agency did not patch the security flaw in time, allowing the hackers “backdoor access” into the company’s massive database of consumer information.

The revelation comes as the United Kingdom and the United States are locked in a dispute over Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s decision to allow the Chinese tech giant Huawei to help build Britain’s 5G network.

The British government has claimed that Huawei will only work on the “periphery” of the nation’s 5G network and that it will not have access to the “core” of the infrastructure.

Officials from the U.S. presented evidence to Boris Johnson’s government that Huawei has built-in a similar “back door” entrance into its mobile networks, raising fears that the firm could be used as an espionage tool by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

“We have evidence that Huawei has the capability secretly to access sensitive and personal information in systems it maintains and sells around the world,” said Robert O’Brien, the national security advisor to President Donald Trump.

387,Cardinal Zen: Vatican Is ‘Giving Everything’ to China’s Communists,['Thomas D. Williams'],"ROME — Cardinal Joseph Zen said this week that the Vatican seeks compromise with China’s Communist Party (CCP), but they want “complete surrender.”

Zen — the former bishop of Hong Kong — has been a vocal critic of the Vatican’s rapprochement with the CCP, insisting that Pope Francis is “naïve” in dealing with a country he knows little about.

In September, 2018, the Vatican signed a secret agreement with China regarding the appointment of future Catholic bishops in the country. The provisions of the deal have never been made public but Vatican observers unanimously assume that the Holy See yielded some authority in the naming of bishops to the CCP.

“The pope doesn’t know much about China. And he may have some sympathy for the Communists, because in South America, the Communists are good guys, they suffer for social justice,” Zen told Catholic News Agency (CNA). “But not the [Chinese] Communists. They are persecutors.”

“So the situation is, humanly speaking, hopeless for the Catholic Church: Because we can always expect the Communists to persecute the Church, but now [faithful Catholics] don’t get any help from the Vatican,” he said.

“The Vatican is helping the government, surrendering, giving everything into their hands,” Zen said.

Last December, Cardinal Zen said that Pope Francis’ policies in dealing with the CCP are “killing” the underground Church in that country.

“Unfortunately, my experience of my contact with the Vatican is simply disastrous,” the cardinal said, noting his particular distress over the Vatican’s deal with Beijing over the naming of bishops and a subsequent Vatican document allowing Catholic clergy to register with the state-run pseudo-church.

“A secret agreement, being so secret you can’t say anything,” Zen said of the deal. “We don’t know what is in it. Then the legitimization of the seven excommunicated bishops. That’s incredible, simply incredible.”

“But even more incredible is the last act: the killing of the underground,” he said.

“Now they finished their job,” the cardinal said in reference to a document bearing the title “Pastoral guidelines of the Holy See concerning the civil registration of clergy in China” regarding Catholic priests enlisting in the state-controlled Catholic Patriotic Association (CPA), which does not recognize the authority of Rome.

The document offered Chinese clergy the opportunity to register with the CPA in good conscience as long as they specify that they are acting without failing in their duty “to remain faithful to the principles of Catholic doctrine.”

While hastening to insist it “understands and respects the choice of those who, in conscience, decide that they are unable to register under the current conditions,” by explicitly authorizing membership in the CPA, the Vatican has removed its support for those who do not wish to do so.

This last act is “simply incredible,” Cardinal Zen said. “The document says, ‘To minister openly, you need to register with the government.’ And then you have to sign. To sign something in which it says that you have to support the independent church.”

“The document contains something against our orthodoxy and they are encouraged to sign,” he said. “When you sign, you accept to be a member of that church under the leadership of the communist party. So terrible, terrible.”

The next time I see the pope, “I’m going to tell him ‘you are encouraging a schism. You are legitimizing the schismatic church in China,’” Zen said. “Incredible.”

It is the second time in a matter of days the U.N. body has publicly backed the Communist regime.

The agency’s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, delivered his unstinting praise of Beijing at a gathering of international foreign and security policy leaders in Germany.

The Ethiopian told other governments to step up their efforts to prepare for the virus, saying “it’s impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take.”

Tedros rejected outright claims China’s bureaucratic paralysis and institutional negligence had in any way contributed to the global spread of the disease.

Instead he wants China to serve as a model of efficiency and advanced medical care.

His assessment came as global concern remained high about the spread of the virus, which first emerged in China’s central Hubei province in December, with the first death outside Asia reported in France this weekend.

The death toll jumped to 1,665 in mainland China on Sunday after 142 more people died from the virus. More than 68,000 people have now been infected — but the number of new cases of the COVID-19 strain continued to decline.

Despite those numbers, Tedros said WHO is encouraged there has not yet been widespread transmission outside China and “the steps China has taken to contain the outbreak at its source appear to have bought the world time.”

“We’re encouraged that an international team of experts is now on the ground working closely with Chinese counterparts to understand the outbreak,” Tedros told the Munich Security Conference.

On January 28 Tedros made a similar announcement praising China, expressing confidence in the measures it had taken to control the spread of the contagion, as Breitbart News reported.

China’s government has since suspended most access to Wuhan, the city at the center of the outbreak. Restrictions have expanded to cities with a total of 60 million people in the broadest anti-disease measures ever imposed. Restaurants, shops and other businesses nationwide were ordered to close.

The Lunar New Year holiday was extended to keep factories and offices closed, but now officials have been ordered to revive business activity as economic losses mount.

On Sunday, a host of new reprimands were made against officials in the virus-hit province, including the deputy governor of Qichun county who “cut corners and worked around the centralised quarantine order,” according to Hubei authorities.

Five other party officials from across Hubei were given warnings for offences such as not preventing mass gatherings in their areas.

China’s central bank said it will also disinfect banknotes with ultraviolet light or high temperatures and store them for up to 14 days before they are put back into circulation.

Last week the WHO appealed for $675 million in special, one-off funding to deliver two months worth of direct aid to China and international agencies working to counter the epidemic.

389,Boris Visit to U.S. Cancelled After Trump 'Slammed' Phone in China Row,['Kurt Zindulka'],"Boris Johnson cancelled a planned visit to the White House after a row over China in which President Trump slammed the phone down on him, according to reports.

Prime Minister Johnson was originally due to visit the White House last month following his election win, before postponing the meeting until February.

However, following a heated phone call with the American leader, the Prime Minister has cancelled his trip for fear causing a deeper rift, according to Business Insider.

Donald Trump was said to have been “apoplectic” in his phone call with Johnson while discussing the Briton’s decision to allow Chinese tech giant Huawei help build the United Kingdom’s 5G network, before slamming the phone down on the British leader.

Washington believes Huawei represents a significant security risk, and that Britain’s deal with it will compromise the world-beating Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network which encompasses the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada.

Pinkerton: Did the British Reclaim Their Sovereignty – Only to Surrender It to China? https://t.co/Noeq4Oxpcc — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 9, 2020

A post-Brexit trade deal between the U.S. and the United Kingdom has been seen as a top priority for both Trump and Johnson, yet spats over the requested extradition of the wife of an American diplomat, Iran, and Huawei have reportedly caused friction between them.

The Prime Minister and the President will now not meet until June at the G7 summit at Camp David.

In response to the cancelled White House visit, Stever Baker, chairman of the European Research Group (ERG) of Brexiteer Tory MPs, told The Times: “We need to be negotiating with the U.S. now. I’m concerned that our negotiating mandate isn’t already out there. Time is running out with our best ally as we head to a presidential election.”

Mr Johnson has refrained from making foreign trips to secure trade deals for Britain — which it had not been allowed to do during its time in the EU — and let his foreign secretary Dominic Raab take the lead.

Downing Street has reportedly cancelled trade missions to New Zealand and Australia, with an official at the prime ministerial residence saying there is “a lot of concern about this.”

“If we don’t do any trade tours this year, it’s going to affect the entire Brexit process,” they said.

Farage: UK’s Huawei Decision ‘Imperils Intelligence Sharing’, U.S. Trade Deal https://t.co/vjhICByqOF — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 14, 2020

Brexit campaign leader Nigel Farage, who recently met with the President at the Oval Office, said that there is “growing concern” in Washington over Johnson’s decision to allow Huawei access to the British 5G network.

“The recent decision of the UK government to involve the Chinese technology firm Huawei in the creation of our 5G network imperils not just intelligence sharing but a future trade deal passing in Congress,” Mr Farage warned.

390,Pentagon Chief Mark Esper Cautions World: ‘Wake Up’ to China Threat,['Simon Kent'],"China steals Western capabilities, intimidates smaller nation states and seeks “advantage by any means and at any cost,” U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper cautioned on Saturday as he cast the world’s most populous nation as a disruptive threat to world order.

Esper used an address at the 2020 Munich Security Conference in Germany to give a comprehensive condemnation of China that he said topped the Pentagon’s list of potential adversaries, followed by Russia and “rogue states” such as North Korea and Iran.

“The Chinese Communist Party is heading even faster and further in the wrong direction – more internal repression, more predatory economic practices, more heavy-handedness, and most concerning for me, a more aggressive military posture,” he said.

He said Beijing has made clear its long-term intentions and said Europe and the rest of the world must “wake up” to the threats that China poses.

He also accused Beijing of deploying a “nefarious strategy” through the telecommunications firm, Huawei.

The warnings follow a similar one made last September in London when Esper cautioned European allies to be wary of China’s growing global influence, as Breitbart News reported.

On that occasion Esper said countries that grow too dependent on Chinese investment and trade become susceptible to coercion and retribution when they cross Beijing.

Esper was making the case for the Trump administration’s argument for doing more to counter what he called efforts by China and Russia to “disrupt the international order” to gain advantage.

He returned to that theme again on Saturday, oulining the risks involved.

At the @MunSecConf, I outlined our strategic priorities, the challenges in this dynamic environment, and how our partners and Allies are key to our success. #MSC2020 pic.twitter.com/g59jzj5aMM — Secretary of Defense Dr. Mark T. Esper (@EsperDoD) February 15, 2020

“The Communist Party and its associated organs, including the People’s Liberation Army, are increasingly operating in theaters outside its borders, including Europe, and seeking advantage by any means, and at any cost,” he said.

“While we often doubt the transparency and forthrightness of Beijing, when it comes to their security aims, we should take the Chinese government at its word,” he said. “They have said that by 2035, the PRC intends to complete its military modernization, and, by 2049, it seeks to dominate Asia as the preeminent global military power.”

With words that echoed the Trump administration’s criticisms of Iran, Esper said China represses its people and threatens its neighbors.

“We want China to behave like a normal country,” Esper said, adding “and that means the Chinese government needs to change its policies and behaviors.”

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, speaking at the conference later in the day, dismissed the U.S. criticisms, and accused Washington of engaging in a “smear campaign” against Beijing.

Wang said Esper’s comments about the Communist single-party state’s intentions were “not based on facts.”

“I can categorically say that all accusations against China are lies,” Wang said, adding: “But if we replace the subject of the lie from China to America, maybe those lies become facts.”

Melania Trump was girlishly black and white in a two-tone ensemble featuring a plunging v-neck flared skirt tea-length dress by Christian Dior with little white frilly bows checked across. Mrs. Trump cinched her waist with a white scalloped leather corset belt by Azzedine Alaïa.

The belt retails for $1,370 at Bergdorf Goodman. Loyal Fashion Notes readers will recall that Mrs. Trump wore the same belt in a beige leather shade when she visited the Great Wall of China in 2017.

Mrs. Trump paired the Dior dress and Alaïa belt with sporty Saint Laurent black sunglasses and stark white patent leather Christian Louboutin stilettoes — heels you could see from a mile away.

392,Adult Film Shot Inside Public Library During Business Hours Provokes Outrage,['Katherine Rodriguez'],"An adult film shot during business hours at a public library in Santa Monica, California, is provoking outrage among neighbors who say the content of the film is inappropriate for public display — especially in front of children.

“God forbid, a child walked in the library and walked right in on the middle of it. That’s my biggest concern,” neighbor Janet McLaughlin told KCAL. “Children don’t need to be exposed to this. If you want to do porn, stick to the hotels.”

The video is more than ten minutes long and was filmed on Santa Monica’s city streets and the Santa Monica Public Library-Ocean Branch.

According to the controversial video, a woman exposes herself on the streets — including once in front of an elementary school — and carries out multiple sex acts inside the library.

McLaughlin was so disgusted upon finding out about the movie’s existence that she went on social media to make city leaders aware of the issue.

But McLaughlin says leaders are aware.

“They say that it is a misdemeanor and unless they witness it themselves, there is nothing they can do about it,” she said.

The man’s face in the video is obscured and is never shown. The female in the clip is also unidentified. The video was reportedly uploaded to a site called Pornhub, which pays by the click.

“We have to have laws to stop them from doing things that puts children in harm’s way,” said McLaughlin.",https://www.breitbart.com/local/2020/02/17/adult-film-shot-inside-public-library-during-business-hours-provokes-outrage/
393,Country Singer Daniel Lee Martin Dies from Apparent Suicide After Charges of Child Sex Abuse,['Warner Todd Huston'],"Country singer Daniel Lee Martin was found dead last week of an apparent suicide after being brought up on charges of child sex abuse.

Martin was found on Friday dead from an apparent gunshot wound in his home in Pasco County, Florida. The scene was discovered by Pasco County Sheriff’s officers as they were attempting to serve another warrant on the singer, People magazine reported.

“The warrants included three counts of sexual exploitation on a minor, three counts of aggravated sexual battery, two counts of committing an aggravated sexual battery and one count of solicitation of a minor to commit rape of a child,” People added.

Officers gained forced entry to Martin’s home when he did not respond to their hails at his door.

Martin, 54, was arrested for abusing victims under 13 going back at least to 2014. the singer and TV host was charged with abusing three children on January 27. He posted $15,000 bail and was released three hours after his arrest, according to the Tampa Bay Times.

One of the victims alleged that Martin took her to his Port Richey, Florida, home and began fondling himself while showing her pornographic movies.

His trial on the current charges was scheduled for March.

Police also noted that the singer and TV host was arrested in 2018 on similar charges in Williamson County, Tennessee.

Martin’s albums included “All That I Am” in 2003 and “On My Way to You” in 2007. He also starred with his wife in the 2016 CarbonTV show Til Death Do Us Part. The couple divorced in 2018. He most recently appeared on the Sportsman Channel series Brotherhood Outdoors.

394,Justin Bieber Celebrates ‘Giving His Life’ to Jesus,['Thomas D. Williams'],"Pop superstar Justin Bieber opened up on his relationship with God in an interview with Apple Music’s Zane Lowe last week, in which Grammy-winner underscored the “free gift” of accepting Jesus.

“The way I look at my relationship with God and with Jesus is, I’m not trying to earn God’s love by doing good things,” said the 25-year-old Bieber. “God has already loved me for who I am before I did anything to earn and deserve it.”

“It’s a free gift by accepting Jesus, and just giving your life to Him,” Bieber insisted. “And what he did is the gift, the forgiveness is the thing that we look at and, ‘I’m going to worship you, God, because you gave me something so good.’”

Bieber, who recently returned to music after a five-year hiatus, released the solo single “Yummy” on January 3, 2020, which debuting at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. The following month, he released his fifth studio album, Changes, on February 14, 2020.

Baptized in 2014 by Pentecostal pastor Carl Lentz of Hillsong Church New York, Bieber told Apple Music last week that he tries to live more by love than by rules.

“And so you live that life of like, ‘I don’t want to cheat on my wife, not because it’s the right thing to do, but because I don’t want to hurt her,’ see the difference there?” he said.

In the interview, Bieber also talked about his past self-destructive behavior — which included accusations of vandalism, DUI, and resisting arrest — crediting God and good Christian role models with his recovery.

“I don’t know if I’d be alive, for sure. It was dark, really dark,” said the Canadian-born artist. “So I’m very, very grateful to have influences in my life that have played a huge part in me seeing their relationship with Jesus and their relationship with their wives, and their relationship with their kids, and saying, ‘That’s what I want,’ and I’m striving after that.”

“So I was thinking too, obviously when we want to be successful in certain things, there’s things we have to work hard at,” Bieber mused. “But striving for God’s love, or God’s approval, or people’s approval, it’s like God’s told me, He said — I mean I don’t hear from God audibly — but I feel like God’s, when he sees us, he’s not this God that a lot of people think, that like judgmental, and he’s a God that accepts us for who we are, and loves us through our pain and through our dirt.”

A cell phone video captured the man— wearing camouflage pants, a red bandanna, and sunglasses— as he knelt on top of the checkout counter while playing music which blasted throughout the Studio City Ralph’s store.

Most customers looked confused and stared and laughed while a store employee tried to stop the renegade guitarist from playing another note.

It took several security guards before the store finally pulled the plug on the random rock concert, KABC reported.

After the music was cut off, the man asked the crowd, “Are you not entertained?” making a reference to the 2000 film Gladiator.

396,Delingpole: Why Is Boris Allowing Eco-Fascists to Run Riot in Britain?,['James Delingpole'],"Extinction Rebellion vandals are digging up the lawns outside Cambridge’s grandest college Trinity and have blocked one of the roundabouts near the city centre.

Why aren’t the police arresting them? Why should taxpayers have to pay for the damage done? And what does this say about the future of Britain under a green tyranny where hardcore environmental activists and the Boris Johnson administration appear to have formed an alliance in opposition to the British people?

Here are the scenes in Cambridge today, dodgy anarchists wearing the fashionable Extinction Rebellion hat, digging up Cambridge’s manicured lawns under the rainbow flag.

Only fellows allowed on the grass!’ @xr_cambridge pic.twitter.com/wBjAH8nJ93 — Cambridge Food Tour (@cambfoodtour) February 17, 2020

And here are the same unruly mob closing down one of Cambridge’s thoroughfares, as if it’s entirely up to them who does and doesn’t get to use the public highway.

To be clear: we don’t want to spend our Sunday blocking roads in the p***ing rain and howling wind but our politicians have failed us. We have 10 years to fundamentally change economies to avoid cascading climate & ecological impacts. We won’t stop until we see change. pic.twitter.com/yZNX4vwnPb — XR Cambridge (@xr_cambridge) February 16, 2020

And here are local people fast losing patience with the apparent reluctance of the authorities — notably Cambridge police — to do the job they are paid for and maintain law and order.

Shockingly, almost unbelievably, instead of clearing away Extinction Rebellion’s makeshift roadblock, the local police have actually chosen to formalise the protest by using their own ’emergency police powers’ to close roads officially. Buses have been diverted. ‘Pedestrians and cyclists will not be affected’, the Cambridge Police Twitter account tells us primly and with, perhaps, a hint of relish at being able to participate in this orgy of environmental virtue-signalling.

Extinction Rebellion destroy prized Trinity College lawn in mass protest https://t.co/asPiNYPJQY This makes me angry as a Cambridge man. And as a taxpayer I’m doubly angry as the police stood and watched. Pure mindless vandalism. Lock them up. — Rod Bishop (@rodbishop15) February 17, 2020

None of this should have been allowed to happen. You may say – not unreasonably – that this is God’s punishment against Cambridge for being such a stronghold of entrenched Social Justice Warrior stupidity; you may argue — again quite correctly — that because lots of people in Cambridge share Extinction Rebellion’s environmental concerns and support a lot of its aims this is simply a case of poetic justice, the biter bit; you may say that having appointed a talentless, thick, failed Civil Service apparatchik such as Dame Sally Davies as its next Master, Trinity lost all claim to being a serious academic institution so frankly who cares what happens to its poxy swards?

But the wider and more important issue here surely is that Britain’s energy, environmental – and now, policing – policies have been devolved to the eco-fascist extreme.

Extinction Rebellion is a ‘destabilising and extremist’ organisation; its objective is ‘system change’, which means bringing down Britain’s existing democratic system. If achieved, this would cause ‘rapid economic disaster’.

These are the words of a report, co-written last year by Richard Walton, formerly head of the Metropolitan Police’s Counter-Terrorism Command.

How can it be possible that a government committed to restoring law and order to broken Britain can let be allowing such destabilising extremists to be causing such mayhem with such impunity?

Earlier this year, the government had a brief chance to outlaw Extinction Rebellion, initially by publicly acknowledging it for the menace it is.

It had the perfect chance when Extinction Rebellion (XR) was included by counter-terrorism police on a list of extremist ideologies that should be reported to the government’s anti-terrorism Prevent programme.

But when leftist activists including the Guardian kicked up a massive stink about this supposed injustice, Boris Johnson’s virtue-signalling ministers seized the chance to express outrage that a ‘peaceful’ protest group could be bracketed with terrorists.

Never mind that Extinction Rebellion causes more economic damage to Britain than all its more violent terrorist equivalents put together — policing it in London alone cost more than £37 million last year, more than twice the budget for its Violent Crime Taskforce: we are effectively being asked to accept that because Extinction Rebellion hasn’t tried to kill anyone and because a few upper-middle-class airheads and brainwashed government ministers think their aims are kind of fluffy and cute, they can, therefore, close down the public highway and dig up ancient lawns and generally make a nuisance of themselves at their leisure.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson himself — always and ever keener to be liked more than he is to take a moral stand on any issue – has helped sow the seeds of future ruin by failing to confront Extinction Rebellion. Instead, he has given them carte blanche with idiot declarations like the one he made last year when he said:

“I deplore their tactics but I basically think that they are right to rebel against the extinctions that are taking place.”

First, what extinctions is he talking about? There have been none recently — certainly none ever caused by ‘climate change’.

Second, what kind of message does it send out to these extremists to tell them that essentially the moral justice of their cause has the endorsement of the Prime Minister?

Boris Johnson’s administration is heading towards green ruination – and it has only itself to blame. These protests in Cambridge are merely a taste of the disruption to come. No one, especially not in the working-class communities of the North and the Midlands, voted Conservative at the last election in order to have their streets blocked, their council tax increased, and their cities defiled by patchouli smelling trustafarians called Cressida and Rupert.

On this issue, as on so many others — from the Huawei deal currently souring Anglo-American relations to the HS2 behemoth about to cut a very, very expensive swathe through some of England’s most beautiful countryside — the urgent question needs to be asked: what do Boris Johnson’s ‘Conservatives’ think they are playing at?",https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/02/17/boris-johnson-is-allowing-eco-fascists-to-run-riot-in-britain/

399,Video: Tearful Elton John Helped Off Stage as Pneumonia Forces Rocker to Cancel Show,['Breitbart News'],"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Elton John intends to play his remaining shows in New Zealand and Australia, his tour promoters said Monday, a day after illness caused the singer to lose his voice and cut short a performance.

Video clips posted online by fans at Sunday night’s performance showed John breaking down in tears as he told the cheering crowd he couldn’t go on any longer. The 72-year-old singer said he had walking pneumonia and was assisted off stage.

Tour promoters Chugg Entertainment said John was resting and doctors were confident he would recover. They said a concert planned for Tuesday in Auckland would be delayed until Wednesday on the advice of doctors.

“Elton John was disappointed and deeply upset at having to end his Auckland concert early last night,” the promoters said in their statement.

The concert was part of John’s Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour. As well as the delayed performance on Wednesday, John is scheduled to play again in Auckland on Thursday and then seven performances in Australia before traveling to the U.S. and Canada.

He thanked the concert attendees via an Instagram post and apologized for ending the show early.

“I want to thank everyone who attended tonight’s gig in Auckland. I was diagnosed with walking pneumonia earlier today, but I was determined to give you the best show humanly possible,” John wrote. “I played and sang my heart out, until my voice could sing no more. I’m disappointed, deeply upset and sorry. I gave it all I had.”

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said she watched the show and got to meet John for about five minutes before he started playing.

“You could tell that he wasn’t feeling well and he said he wasn’t feeling well,” Ardern said. “So I think you could see that on the stage last night, which I think is just a credit to his commitment to his fans.”

Ardern said the pair discussed politics and how her toddler daughter Neve loves to dance to his music. John has previously expressed his admiration for the New Zealand leader.

The New Zealand Herald reported that John told the crowd he was ill but that he didn’t want to miss the show. He slumped on a stool and required medical attention after performing “Someone Saved My Life Tonight,” but recovered and continued to play, the newspaper reported. Later, as he he attempted to sing “Daniel,” he realized he had no voice left and was escorted off stage.

Elton John had just returned to New Zealand after performing at the Academy Awards in Los Angeles. He won an Oscar for best original song for his theme song for the movie “Rocketman.”

400,Box Office: ‘Sonic’ Speeds to $57M Debut,['Breitbart News'],"NEW YORK (AP) — The redesigned “Sonic the Hedgehog” showed plenty of teeth at the box office, speeding to a $57 million debut, according to studio estimates Sunday, while “Parasite” saw one of the largest post-Oscars bumps in years following its best picture win.

Paramount Pictures’ “Sonic the Hedgehog” came in well above expectations, especially for a movie that just months ago was a laughing stock. After its first trailer was greeted with ridicule on social media last year, “Sonic” was postponed three months to give its title character a design overhaul — including fixing Sonic’s eerily human teeth.

The makeover worked and audiences responded by making “Sonic the Hedgehog” the weekend’s top film and the highest-grossing opening for a video game adaptation, not accounting for inflation. For Paramount, it’s a welcome success following misfires such as “Gemini Man” and “Terminator: Dark Fate.” The studio estimates “Sonic” will gross $68 million over the four-day Presidents Day holiday weekend.

“If you don’t listen to your customer, and this goes for any business, then you’re going to fail,” said Chris Aronson, distribution chief for Paramount. “We retooled Sonic in a way that was obviously very satisfying for the fans and they were very forgiving. Now that they’ve seen the movie, they love the movie. It all worked out.”

The Sega video game adaptation, directed by Jeff Fowler, drew decent reviews (63% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and an A CinemaScore from moviegoers. The $87 million production co-stars Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik with Ben Schwartz supplying Sonic’s voice.

Bong Joon Ho’s “Parasite” had its biggest weekend in its 19th week of release. Neon put “Parasite” into its widest release yet (2,001 theaters) following its historic win at the Oscars. (“Parasite” was the first non-English-language film to win best picture in the 92-year history of the Academy Awards.) And despite the film already being available for weeks on digital platforms and on DVD, its $5.5 million weekend is the largest Oscars bump for a best-picture winner since “Gladiator” in 2001.

Last week’s opening of “Birds of Prey” followed up its limp debut by sliding to second with $17.1 million. Following its disappointing opening, some theaters retitled the movie “Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey,” instead of “Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn).”

It was a busy weekend in theaters, with a handful of other new releases — “The Photograph,” “Fantasy Island,” “Downhill” — seeking to capitalize on both Valentine’s Day on Friday and Presidents Day on Monday.

“Fantasy Island,” the Blumhouse horror remake of the ’70s TV show, fared the best, collecting $12.4 million in ticket sales despite terrible reviews. Sony Pictures handled the release of the low-budget, PG-13 film, which earned just a 9% fresh score on Rotten Tomatoes.

Universal Pictures “The Photograph,” a romance starring Issa Rae and Lakeith Stanfield and produced by Will Packer (“Girls Trip,” “Ride Along”), opened with $12.2 million. The film, written and directed by Stella Meghie, cost $15 million to make.

“Downhill,” from Disney’s Fox Searchlight Pictures, debuted with $4.7 million, a modest start for a film starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Will Ferrell. A remake of the acclaimed Swedish film “Force Majeure” by Ruben Östlund, “Downhill” didn’t do great with critics but fared even worse with audiences. They gave it a D CinemaScore.

Neon followed up its “Parasite” Oscar win with the Valentine’s Day release of “Portrait of a Lady on Fire,” one of 2019′s most acclaimed films. Following a one-week qualifying run in December, Celine Sciamma’s French period romance opened in 22 theaters with a strong per-theater average of about $20,000.

Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included.

1. “Sonic the Hedgehog,” $57 million ($44.3 million international).

2. “Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey,” $17.1 million ($23 million international).

401,Lena Dunham Makes Runway Debut at London Fashion Week,['John Binder'],"Actress and left-wing activist Lena Dunham made her runway debut at London Fashion Week last week alongside traditional fashion models.

Lena Dunham, a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, walked in a show for the brand 16Arlington of which she has worn designs by in the recent past.

“It’s an adrenaline rush out there,” Dunham told Vogue of walking in the 16Arlington show. “I have to say, I think I was very coddled today—all of the girls were running and doing their quick changes, but people were there at every juncture telling me where to go, so I feel lucky about that.”

“It’s hard for me to imagine that I’m going to get a ton of job offers off the back of it, but it was a delight,” Dunham said.

The Girls star and former Hillary Clinton 2016 campaign celebrity surrogate previously wore a dress by 16Arlington to the premiere of Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood.

“And what I love about [16Arlington] is that they make something that fits your body beautifully, but also has a sense of humor. When I went to the Once Upon a Time premiere, I was like, ‘I look like a hot Muppet!'” Dunham said.

We last heard from Dunham earlier this month when she announced that Joker star Joaquin Phoenix’s unhinged Oscars acceptance speech inspired her want to become vegan.

403,"Farage: Huawei Decision Threatens Five Eyes, Trade, Future of NATO",['Victoria Friedman'],"Nigel Farage warned that Boris Johnson’s decision to allow Chinese firm Huawei to build part of the UK’s 5G data network threatens Five Eyes security cooperation, a future trade deal with the United States, and perhaps even the future of NATO.

“Whilst I am pleased with much that the Boris government is doing, the decision to involve Huawei in the 5G network is the worst decision any British government has made in years,” Farage told The Sydney Morning Herald.

Mr Farage continued: “It threatens the Five Eyes partnership, our prospects of a new trade agreement with the US and Australia, and perhaps even the future of NATO.”

“It must be reversed,” he added.

Both the United States and Australia — members of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network along with New Zealand, Canada, and the United Kingdom — have warned against the UK allowing the Chinese firm access to British telecommunication networks as it would present a security risk.

Amidst reports from the United States that show Huawei has a backdoor to its clients’ information that could be exploited by the Communist superpower and Mr Johnson’s decision to continue engaging Huawei, American politicians have become increasingly concerned.

Report: Chinese Army Stole Over 13 Million British Citizens’ Personal Data https://t.co/ImQe4loOI8 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 17, 2020

Mr Farage told his LBC listeners on Monday night that he had come back from a trip to Washington D.C. having met congressmen and senators from both sides of the political divide who were “really, really worried about this decision”.

“[Huawei] is not a private company, it is effectively run by the Chinese Communist Party and they have a record of wanting to try and steal information and try to spy on everybody,” he said, continuing that Johnson’s decision poses “risks to us getting a trade deal through congress and that trade deal is very important in our negotiation in terms of our leverage on Brussels”.

The American ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell had tweeted on Sunday night that President Donald Trump had “called me from Air Force One and instructed me to make clear that any nation who choose to use an untrustworthy 5G vendor will jeopardise our ability to share intelligence and information at the highest level”.

The warning was to Germany — which is mulling likewise Huawei involvement in its 5G infrastructure — but likewise could be directed at the UK which still has a chance to reverse its decision.

While publicly the President has told the UK that its decision to engage Huawei is its own, President Trump reportedly slammed the phone on Prime Minister Johnson after a conversation in which the U.S. leader was “apoplectic” over Boris’s decision to agree to the Chinese company’s involvement.

There is a great amount of concern over Huawei within Johnson’s own government. Bob Seely, the MP for the Isle of Wight who sits on the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, told Nigel Farage on his LBC radio programme he feels “very strongly” about Huawei “because I think it is going to be one of the significant issues of the 21st century”.

“There has been precious little debate in the 15 years since Huawei’s been in this country. There’s not been one single parliamentary debate,” Mr Seely said.

The MP continued: “China is a one-party state that is using artificial intelligence and big data [to build] an Orwellian monitoring system, the kind which the world has never seen before. Do we really want to give that state — via a front organisation called Huawei, which is not in any meaningful way a private company — do we want to give China a significant stake in our critical national infrastructure, our 5G, through which everything will function in the next few years?”",https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/02/19/farage-huawei-decision-threatens-five-eyes-trade-future-nato/
404,UK Employment Rate Reached Record High as It Leaves the EU,['Kurt Zindulka'],"Defying naysaying anti-Brexiteers, the United Kingdom marked its departure from the European Union by recording the highest levels of employment ever, with nearly 33 million people in work.

The number of people employed in the UK rose by 180,000 in the three months to December, posting another record high of 32.93 million, with unemployment remaining flat at 1.29 million. Average wages climbed to £512 per week, which adjusted for inflation is the highest level since March of 2008 during the financial crisis.

Women were the main driver of the rise in employment, with 150,000 women joining the workforce in the quarter, reaching a record 15.61 million, according to the figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

“Employment has continued its upward trend, with the rate nudging up to another record high. In particular, the number of women working full-time grew strongly over the past year,” said ONS deputy head of labour market statistics Myrto Miltiadou.

In response to the record numbers, Employment Minister Mims Davies said: “As we embark on a new chapter as an independent nation outside the EU, we do so with a record-breaking jobs market and business confidence on the rise.”

“With wages still outpacing inflation, UK workers can expect their money to go further as we look ahead to a decade of renewal,” he added.

UK Economy: 13 Quarters of Growth Since EU Referendum… beating Germany, Eurozone https://t.co/mCKDJNa04a — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 12, 2019

Ahead of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, the number of EU nationals working in Britain rose by the largest percentage since early 2017, up 133,000 from the previous quarter, reaching 2.44 million.

A record 5.81 million people born outside the UK are currently working in the country, with 25,000 non-EU foreign-born workers entering the labour force, totalling 3.37 million.

In response to the rise in foreign-born workers, Dr Ben Greening, Executive Director of Migration Watch UK, said: “These figures show that the UK is as attractive as ever for migrant workers, with a new record of 5.8 million non-UK born people in employment. They made up nearly half of the growth in the number of workers over the past year.”

“The government trumpets record employment levels but that includes nearly 160,000 more workers from abroad on the year and still, we see no pick-up of growth in wages or productivity. These are the realities and we can only hope that immigration proposals unveiled this week will be clearly focused on bringing numbers down,” he added in comments seen by Breitbart London.

UK Population Set to Hit 70m in Just over a Decade, Three-Quarters of Increase Driven by Migrationhttps://t.co/dUP61Th2YO — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 22, 2019

As a part of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Brexit strategy, the government is planning an overhaul of the immigration laws in the UK, by introducing an Australia style points-based system, in order to end the “reliance on importing cheap, low-skilled labour”.

Under the new system, migrants earning below £25,600 will need to have at least 70 ‘points’ to work in the UK. The points will be determined based on an applicant’s salary, education level, English proficiency, and prospective job offers.

“The system will be simpler and fairer and will not discriminate between countries and would return democratic control of immigration to the British people,” a Downing Street official told The Times.

“The PM stressed that we must demonstrate that the UK is open and welcoming to talent from across the world but the new system would end reliance on importing cheap, low-skilled labour, bringing down immigration numbers overall,” he added.

405,Sadiq Khan Begs Brussels to Give EU 'Associate Membership' to Britons,['Kurt Zindulka'],"In a meeting today in Brussels Sadiq Khan, the Europhile mayor of London, will lobby for the European Union to grant “associate citizenship” for Britons, allowing continued free movement within the bloc.

The anti-Brexit mayor, who will be meeting with the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, and the president of the European Parliament, David Sassoli, said that free movement should be at “the heart” of negotiations between Britain and the EU.

The proposal would permit UK citizens to retain freedom of movement and residence within the European Union, as well as access to healthcare and other welfare programmes within member state nations. It would also allow Britons the ability to vote in parliamentary elections in the EU.

“Like so many Londoners, I am heartbroken that we are no longer a member of the European Union, but that doesn’t mean our country’s future can’t be closely linked with the rest of Europe,” Khan told The Guardian.

“The prime minister says his job is to bring the country together and move us forward and I cannot think of a better way of reconciling the differences between British voters who wanted to leave, and the millions of Londoners and British nationals who still feel and want to be European.

“There would be support from millions of Londoners and British nationals who are devastated they are losing their rights as EU citizens. As the UK and EU start their next phase of negotiations, I want this issue of associate citizenship to be at the heart of talks about our future relationship,” he added.

London’s Khan Calls for Cancelling Brexit, Labour to Back Remain https://t.co/8POoZRZ5pG — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 17, 2019

The idea of “associate citizenship” in the EU was first floated by the former prime minister of Belgium, Guy Verhofstadt, and has since been picked up by the anti-Brexit mayor who said it should be at “the heart” of negotiations between Britain and the EU.

Mr Verhofstadt said last month that the bloc is not only considering associate membership for UK citizens but to other people outside of the EU’s structure, further spreading the global reach of the expansionist bloc.

“My idea is that the European Union and European citizenship has to be possible for a European living somewhere else in the world,” he said.

“Citizenship is not limited to a territorial definition of citizenship. But people who have their links with Europe could keep their citizenship with the European Union, so it’s not about the UK only,” he added.

Verhofstadt admitted that his scheme will not be enacted any time soon, saying: “This is not for now, but is for the future, this European citizenship.”

406,Judge Rules Against 'Gestapo' Police Over Transgender Jokes Crackdown,['James Delingpole'],"Harry Miller has won his High Court freedom of speech battle against Humberside Police over his right to make jokes about transgenderism on social media.

Miller, himself an ex-copper, was incensed when Humberside Police sent a police officer round to his home in order to ‘check his thinking’ after some remarks he had made on Twitter were classified as a ‘non-crime hate incident.’

As Miller told Breitbart London last year, he decided that he would fight the issue in the courts rather than accept that the police had any business sniffing through his Twitter feed in search of offensive material.

The judge has agreed that his tweets were legitimate.

Mr Justice Knowles said:

The claimant’s tweets were lawful and there was not the slightest risk that he would commit a criminal offence by continuing to tweet. I find the combination of the police visiting the claimant’s place of work, and their subsequent statements in relation to the possibility of prosecution, were a disproportionate interference with the claimant’s right to freedom of expression because of their potentially chilling effect.

It gets better. He continued:

In this country we have never had a Cheka, a Gestapo or a Stasi. We have never lived in an Orwellian society.

However, the court ruling is unlikely to resolve much because the judge did not accept Miller’s wider challenge against the College of Policing guidelines on ‘hate crime.’

As the BBC reports:

These define a hate incident as “any non-crime incident which is perceived, by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by a hostility or prejudice against a person who is transgender or perceived to be transgender”.

Clearly, if one of the plans of the Boris Johnson/Dominic Cummings/Priti Patel law and order faction in the new administration is to restore commonsense to the English justice system, much work still needs to be done to strip out the entrenched political correctness introduced during the Blair years.

407,Sadiq Khan: ‘All Gender Identities’ Including ‘Non-Binary’ Are Valid,['Jack Montgomery'],"London mayor Sadiq Khan has declared that biological males and females who identify as the opposite sex are indeed what they claim to be, that people who say they are “non-binary” really are neither male nor female, and, moreover, that “All gender identities are valid”.

“Trans women are women. Trans men are men. Non-binary people are non-binary. All gender identities are valid,” Khan tweeted, apparently in aid of “#LGBTHistoryMonth”.

A profusion of gender identities other than male and female have entered the academic and now public discourse in recent years, pushed by left-liberal media and so-called “social justice warriors”.

The publicly-funded British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), for example, recently produced a video series for young schoolchildren in which it is explained that”there are over 100, if not more, gender identities now.”

Trans women are women.

Trans men are men.

Non-binary people are non-binary.

All gender identities are valid.

#LGBTHistoryMonth — Mayor of London (@MayorofLondon) February 16, 2020

Despite his status as the British capital’s first Muslim mayor, Khan appears to be — unlike many of his co-religionists in the country — very comfortable which gender- and sexual orientation-based identity politics.

Indeed, the Labour party politician has previously been criticised for allocating scarce funding to social justice hobby horses such as gender-neutral toilets to “reflect the incredible diversity” of London, even as the increasingly multicultural capital is in the grip of a prolonged violent crime wave.

Khan’s preferred brand of identity politics is race-based, however, with U.S. President Donald Trump being a favourite foil, claiming that “all he cares about is White America.”

He has also slated Brexit leader Nigel Farage as being akin to “the fascists of the 20th century”, along with Hungarian premier Viktor Orban and Italian populist leader and former deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini — with President Trump as their “poster boy”.

408,'House the Irish First' – Protesters Block Housebuilding for 'Non-nationals',['Jack Montgomery'],"Desperate Irish protesters whose families have been waiting up to 15 years for social housing have blocked the construction of new homes for “non-national families”, demanding “local houses for local people”.

“We watch these houses being built, and none of our children on the list are getting them,” one middle-aged woman, who asked to remain anonymous, told The Irish Times.

“They can be 10, 12 years on the list, and they’re going nowhere. There’s no explanation as to why,” she complained.

The ‘House the Irish First’ protest movement, most of whose members are women, has been blocking the housebuilding project at Ladyswell Road in the predominantly working-class Dublin suburb of Mulhuddart since January.

The protesters, who believe too much social housing is going to “non-national families who are not from the area”, are demanding at half of the new homes are set aside for local people on the housing list for the local authority, Fingal County Council.

“We have heard there are two lists,” another protester told The Irish Times.

“We don’t know how it works. What we do know is the list for the girls from around here has not dropped, and non-national families are moving in. We are tired of seeing the girls move out of the area, away from their family supports. Our communities are being broken,” she said.

One of the young women concerned said she had been on the list for seven-and-a-half years already, living cheek by jowl with her sister’s family in a home afflicted by damp, and is still only number 860 out of 6,959 applicants.

Interrogated on the question of whether or not the name ‘House the Irish First’ was racist, one of the women said their group had “nothing to do with racism” but that the housing situation “stokes racism… it makes you bitter…. we haven’t a problem with anyone who needs a house, but it has to be done fairly”.

Fingal County Council insisted it has “long-established policies which are the fairest way possible of allocating housing to those on the list”, based on “meeting the housing needs of the community which includes the elderly, the disabled, the homeless, the Traveller community and also a growing migrant population.”

Mulhuddart’s demographics have transformed dramatically in recent years, with 40 per cent of residents having been born abroad.

409,Lisa Nandy: Let Men Into Women’s Prisons if They Identify as Female,['Kurt Zindulka'],"A candidate in the battle to replace Jeremy Corbyn as the leader of the Labour Party, Lisa Nandy, has said biological men should be allowed into all-female prisons, regardless of the crimes they have committed.

Lisa Nandy, the Member of Parliament for Wigan and one of the three remaining candidates in the Labour leadership race, said that men who identify as women, like convicted child rapist Christopher Worton, who now identifies as Zoe Lynes, should be able to be transferred into female prisons.

“I believe fundamentally in people’s right to self-ID. I believe the gender recognition act strikes the wrong balance in relation to that,” said Nandy, per The Times, adding: “Crimes that are recorded should be recorded as that person wishes having gone through that process.”

“Trans women are women and trans men are men and should be accommodated in the prison of their choosing,” she concluded.

Her statements sparked condemnation from feminist organisations in the UK, including the Women’s Place UK which wrote: “The prison service recognises acute dilemmas over housing trans prisoners. Lisa Nandy sweeps them away as prison governors call for major policy debate and resources. We are shocked at her answer.”

This may result in men becoming the leaders of the UK feminist movement. https://t.co/6DH8ZhATMV — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) February 13, 2020

Nandy’s statements came after her fellow leadership candidate, Rebecca Long-Bailey, called for the Equality Act of 2010 to be amended to allow trans people into single-sex areas. The law currently does not give transgender people special rights to expect access to all-female or all-male spaces, such as changing rooms, bathrooms, and hospital wards.

Long-Bailey dismissed the fears from feminist groups that such a change to the law would endanger rights of women, saying: “There doesn’t need to be differentiation between women’s rights and trans rights.”

Karen Ingala Smith, the chief executive of Nia, a charity that deals with violence against women, rejected the far-left candidate’s claims, saying: “I’ve lost count of the number of victim-survivors of men’s violence who’ve told me how important a women-only service was to them.”

Ms Long-Bailey, seen as the ‘continuity Corbyn’ candidate in the leadership contest, signed a pledge last week that called for the “expulsion” of people and groups who have expressed “bigotted” or “transphobic views” from the Labour Party, including feminist organisations like Woman’s Place UK.

410,'I Have White Advantage' – Woke Archbishop Brands Own Church 'Racist',['Jack Montgomery'],"The Church of England’s most prominent cleric, Justin Welby, said he is “ashamed of our history” and of his supposed advantages as a straight white male.

The Archbishop of Canterbury was speaking ahead of a vote by the Church’s General Synod to “lament, on behalf of Christ’s Church, and apologises for, the conscious and unconscious racism experienced by countless black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) Anglicans in 1948 and subsequent years”.

1948 was the year the Empire Windrush ship landed hundreds of Caribbean migrants in Britain, firing the starting gun on a wave of mass migration to the kingdom from its former empire which continues to the present day.

“I am almost beyond words. Personally, I am sorry and ashamed. I’m ashamed of our history and I’m ashamed of our failure,” Welby said of his Church’s “conscious and unconscious racism”.

“It’s shaming as well as shocking. It is shocking, but it’s profoundly shaming,” he continued, somewhat redundantly, in a speech which even he described as “incoherent”.

“I have white advantage. Educational advantage. Straight advantage. Male advantage… I’m not ashamed of those advantages; I’m ashamed of not knowing I had them,” Welby said.

“[T]here is no doubt when we look at our own Church that we are still deeply institutionally racist. Let’s just be clear about that. I said it to the College of Bishops a couple of years ago and it’s true,” he added, as part of a long harangue on what he sees as an excess of white people in England’s established church.

“Most of us in here [at the Synod], almost all of us, the vast majority of us – well over 85 per cent; and remember 15 per cent is roughly the BAME in this country, so if we were representative it would be 15 per cent – but well over 85 per cent, over 90 per cent, are white,” he complained.

He failed, however, to address the fact that a very significant portion of the 15 per cent ethnic minority share of Britain’s population belong to the Muslim, Hindu, and Sikh faiths, who you would not reasonably expect to see represented at an Anglican assembly.

“I get loads of lists to approve. I get shortlists and longlists and lists of panels for interviews. We’ve just about got past the point in the last two or three years where they’re not all male. But they very, very seldom have minority ethnic people on them – either in applications for lay or clergy posts, senior clergy posts,” Welby said elsewhere in his speech.

“I’ve been trying to play nice. I send them back with a more or less polite note saying I’m not absolutely sure this is what we want. But we cannot go on playing nice – really, can we, I don’t think?” he added, appearing to suggest he thinks it is time to start shutting white people out of Church positions more aggressively.

He gave no indication that he intends to resign from his own prestigious role to make way for an ethnic minority archbishop, however.

411,WATCH: Three Arrested as Extinction Rebellion Violently Clash With Police,['Kurt Zindulka'],"At least three activists were arrested by police in London during the annual “Climate Strike”.

Student climate change activists, Extinction Rebellion and Antifa took to the streets of London on Friday, joining “Climate Strike” protests across the world, shouting slogans like “climate change is fucking real, give us all a Green New Deal” and “the students united will never be defeated”.

In an exclusive Breitbart London video, three of the activists are caught on camera getting arrested by London’s Metropolitan Police.

One of the leaders of the march was told by police that she was “breaking the law” by “obstructing the highway”. After she refused to leave the road she was tackled by the police and dragged into a police van.

Two others were also arrested at the protest for refusing to clear the road.

Antifa also clashed with police, with one masked man dressed in black bloc gear shouting at an officer: “You are fucking scum!”

The student activists have attracted financial support from environmental organisations such as Global Justice Now, Green Peace, and the Green Party, according to the Guardian.

The arrests on Friday came one day after police stood by for some time as members of Extinction Rebellion vandalised government property by digging up the grass outside the Home Office.

This “action” came in response to the expansion of the Pont Balley mine in County Durham, England.

Last year alone the cost of policing Extinction Rebellion protests in London totalled over £37 million — more than double the annual budget of the Violent Crime Taskforce, which is only £15 million.

The strain on resources and manpower limited the police’s ability to investigate other crimes in the capitol.

The climate change alarmist group’s next mass “rebellion” will take place on May 23rd.

412,Douglas Murray: Starbucks Trans Kids Cookie Promo Is 'Sinister',['James Delingpole'],"Starbucks promoting a “transgender youth” charity through the sale of Mermaids cookies is “incredibly sinister” says author Douglas Murray.

“This is the crossover of one of the ugliest bits of capitalism with one of the most sinister things in our time,” says Murray.

Murray, who dedicates a significant chunk of his most recent bestseller The Madness of Crowds to discussing the hijack of transgender issues by the radical left, expressed his fury that so controversial an issue should be so casually used for marketing purposes by an international hot beverage chain.

Starbucks — the British branch — is currently donating 50p of each Mermaids cookie it sells to the British charity Mermaids.

According to the Mail:

Mermaids was set up by Susie Green, who took her son Jack – now Jackie – to Thailand for sex-change surgery at 16, because the NHS would not operate on someone so young. The charity advises Government agencies, schools, the police and social workers. But critics say its advice is not objective, because it is run largely by parents with a transgender child.

Murray believes the association between Starbucks and Mermaids is toxic.

“Mermaids is a British charity which is actually quite notorious. It should be interrogated far more than it is. It claims to be supportive of young people who don’t know what gender they are and to advocate for transgender youth […] I’m very sceptical about this whole thing. We’re allowing something utterly mad to go with the adults giving up. This idea that because you’re feeling a bit feminine one day and a bit masculine on another and it’s all so confusing — no, I don’t accept all of this. I offer a weeks’ supply of actually edible croissant from any of Starbucks’ competitors to anyone who can actually define for me what ‘non-binary’ actually means. Mermaids is an incredibly sinister organisation. I don’t accept that there’s such a thing as transgender youth. I think the adults have left the room on this and it is not for a major multinational like Starbucks to jump on board something on which so little has been thought about ethically and practically.”

He added:

“Telling confused and unhappy children that their lives can be solved by going through incredibly difficult hormonal therapies including puberty blockers and then at a later stage being made into an approximation of the body of the opposite sex? No. No. No!”

Starbucks has backed up its campaign with a TV commercial in which a crop-haired girl called Jemima deliberates as to what she’s going to call herself when she orders her soy latte from Starbucks. Jemima eventually plumps for the name James and the viewer is clearly meant to be full of admiration for her stunning bravery in choosing to give herself this (admittedly very splendid) new Christian name.

But Murray believes this is just another case of glib corporate virtue-signalling by a multinational which can’t even do one job properly.

“There is just one thing Starbucks needs to do right — make coffee — and it can’t even do that. I don’t like the counter of inedible products — croissant that look like rock cakes. It is a great failure that such a dreadful chain should perch in every town in the world. I already had an instinctive, vitriolic loathing of Starbucks. But in the last week, my prejudice against the chain has been ramped up to category ten.”

Why is Starbucks doing it? For the same reason all the most evil and hateful banks and multinationals do it — as a cheap way of deflecting flak from their many critics who see themselves as the unacceptable face of capitalism.

Murray says:

“What these companies are doing are very loud, ostentatious appeals to show that they are on board with the zeitgeist. Barclays Bank, for example, after 2008 had lots of things it should have done and a lot of blame it should have got. The cheapest way you can get is to soak up the woke agenda and do it very visibly. So Barclay bank goes for LGBT Pride Month in a HUGE way. And Starbucks demonstrates it wants to transgender children to the opposite sex with their Mermaid cookie.”

413,65 Per Cent of French Believe French Civilization Will Collapse,['Chris Tomlinson'],"A survey released by polling firm Ifop has claimed that more than six in ten French people think that French civilisation as we know it will collapse.

The survey noted that a third of the people who believed in the collapse. think it will occur in a brutal fashion and put the time frame for the collapse within the next 20 year or so.

One of the chief reasons stated by respondents as the prime cause of a potential collapse is climate change, with 27 per cent stating that climate factors and overconsumption will spell the end for French civilisation, French media outlet L’Aisne Nouvelle reports.

Around 15 per cent of the respondents said that mass migration would be the cause of the collapse, while another 14 per cent stated that internal conflicts within French society, or even civil war, could precipitate it.

Many have warned of a potential civil war in France, including leading radical Islam scholar Gilles Kepel, who stated in 2016 that the “Jihadi Generation” had a goal to destroy Europe in a civil war and rebuild an Islamic society in the aftermath.

The following year, Belgian historian David Engels made a similar prediction saying that “in 20 to 30 years Europe will have become an authoritarian or imperial state, after a phase resembling civil war and decay.”

“I expect a civil war, which will force a fundamental social and political reformation in Europe, whether we like it or not, following the example of the decaying Roman Republic in the first century BC,” he added.

Mass migration is often termed in France as the “Great Replacement”, a term coined by prolific French writer Renaud Camus, and a poll released in February of last year suggested that up to a quarter of French believe in the theory.

Camus explained his theory of replacementism to Breitbart London in late 2018, describing it as people “being treated by managerial politics like an object, a simple product. A product, a producer, and a consumer all at once, a thing, a number, not a human being.”",https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/02/15/65-per-cent-of-french-believe-french-civilization-will-collapse/
414,Scottish Catholic Church Resists Move to Streamline Gender Switching,['Thomas D. Williams'],"The Catholic Church in Scotland has taken a stand in opposition to proposed legislation that would streamline the process of legally changing gender in the country.

The Scottish government has proposed a bill for “gender recognition reform,” claiming that the current system is viewed by many applicants as “demeaning, lengthy, and stressful.”

At the moment, a person can legally change gender if they have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, have lived under their “new” gender for at least two years, and intend to continue to do so for the rest of their life. A Gender Recognition Panel then issues a certificate allowing them to modify their birth certificate to reflect the new gender.

The reform proposed by the Scottish government would remove the medical requirements and the appeal to a Gender Recognition Panel, while shortening the time required to live in one’s “new” gender from two years to three months, as well as dropping the age limit for changing gender from 18 to 16.

In response to the Government’s consultation on the subject, the Director of the Scottish Catholic Parliamentary Office, Anthony Horan, said the Catholic Church believes that “gender cannot be reduced to a mere construct of society that is fluid and changeable.”

“Many people do not believe that gender identity is a matter of choice, or something that may be entirely divorced from the biological sex in which we are born,” Mr. Horan said, “and the right to hold this view must be protected whatever the outcome of the consultation.”

Horan also warned that the government proposal seemed to lack “solid scientific evidence.”

“Gender dysphoria cannot be politicised to the point where the science is side-lined,” he said.

Pointing to a real-life case of gender reassignment run amuck, Horan brought up Karen White, “a biological male and convicted rapist who, following his incarceration, self-identified as female and applied to be moved to a women’s prison.”

When White was eventually moved to a women’s prison, he sexually assault a number of the female inmates.

In an article published Monday by Crux, a U.S.-based Catholic online news site, an unnamed spokesman for the Catholic Church in Scotland is cited as saying that the Church is deeply concerned with the unintended side effects of de-medicalising gender dysphoria.

Moreover, redefining something as fundamental as male and female “is not within the purview of government or parliamentarians,” the spokesman told Crux.

Allowing young people under the age of 18 years to legally change gender “puts them on a dangerous path towards irreversible medical experimentation,” he said, adding that the long-term effects of using puberty blockers are “largely unknown” so politicians “should not proceed with radical legal reforms in this area.”

415,Spain Searching for 143 Missing Boat Migrants Near Canary Islands,['Breitbart London'],"BARCELONA, Spain (AP) – Spain on Tuesday was searching for some 143 people missing on five migrant boats en route to the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean, according to Spain’s maritime rescue service.

A Civil Guard plane was searching for the boats near the islands of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, off the northwest coast of Africa, the service said.

Authorities were alerted about the missing boats on Monday afternoon.

Helena Maleno, of the human rights group Walking Borders, told The Associated Press the migrants, including women and children, are believed to have departed from the northwest coast of Africa between Friday and Saturday.

Although the total number of sea crossings to Spain decreased by more than 50% in 2019, arrivals via the dangerous Atlantic route to the Canary Islands doubled.

416,"Labour Leadership Candidate Confusion: Abolish The Monarchy, but Make Meghan Markle Queen",['Oliver Jj Lane'],"A leading candidate to take the helm of Britain’s drifting left-wing opposition party said she would abolish Britain’s Royal Family — before apparently having a change of heart and remarking she’d like to see U.S. television actress Meghan Markle become the British head of state instead.

Speaking in a televised leadership debate with fellow finalists for the Labour Party top job, Lisa Nandy was invited first to respond to whether the candidates would vote to abolish the monarchy if there was a referendum on the matter. Nandy quickly replied that “I’m a democrat” and consequently she would vote to get rid of the Queen, but appeared to quickly regret her honest answer when both other candidates said they would vote to retain the institution.

Piping up for the last word in a segment where respondents had been chastised by television host Krishnan Guru-Murthy for elaborating during what was supposed to be a quick-fire yes-or-no round of questions, Nandy added paradoxically that despite her desire to abolish the monarchy, “I’d quite like to see Queen Meghan at some point”.

Megxit: Bookie Slashes Odds on Meghan Markle Running for U.S. President https://t.co/xOjVotCJ4L — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 11, 2020

To what extent the quip betrays a lack of understanding of how the monarchy works is unclear — Meghan Markle is not in the line of succession, although her husband is sixth in line after Prince Charles, Prince William, and Prince William’s three children. She and Prince Harry have also both been stripped of their working Royal positions and titles this year after deciding to move to Canada and not fulfil their royal duties.

While the abolition of the monarchy is by no means an active political debate in the United Kingdom, where approval for both the institution of having a hereditary head of state, as well as the individuals involved, remains high, the question in the debate comes in the context of the end of the Jeremy Corbyn era, the hard-left leader of the Labour party since 2015.

Mr Corbyn has been a long term opponent of the institution of monarchy and answers to the question may be seen as a yardstick of how far a potential future leader wishes to disassociate themselves with the election-losing positions of the outgoing leader.

Labour Leadership Candidate Long-Bailey Says Idea That Britons Rejected Socialism is ‘Bollocks’ https://t.co/lhQMkMogJU — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 27, 2020

One candidate who has persistently signalled her intention to carry the flag for Corbynism into the future is Rebecca Long-Bailey. So convinced that the Labour Party lost the 2019 general election, giving Boris Johnson’s Conservatives a landslide win in spite of Labour’s policies and not because of them, in January leaked audio of Long-Bailey remarking that it was “bollocks” the British people had rejected socialism emerged.

She followed up this thread again in the Monday night leader’s debate, telling the host there was not a single part of Corbyn’s last manifesto — on which the party lost the general election — that she would tear up, insisting instead the messaging was wrong. She told the audience: “We’re the party with the policies to make people’s lives better… there’s not one [policy] that I would drop… there’s no such thing as Corbynism, it’s socialism”.

Long-Bailey explained that while some policies in the manifesto were deliverable within a single five-year parliament, others — such as a four-day working week — would take longer, and said putting it in the manifesto for the election “confused people”.",https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/02/18/labour-leadership-candidate-confusion-abolish-the-monarchy-but-make-meghan-markle-queen/
417,German Court Orders Tesla to Stop Cutting Down Trees,['Lucas Nolan'],"Elon Musk’s Tesla has been ordered to stop clearing forest land near the capital of Berlin, Germany, to build its new “Gigafactory.”

Reuters reports that a German court has ordered Tesla to stop cutting down trees in a forest near the capital of Berlin to make room for its first European “Gigafactory.” The electric vehicle maker announced plans last November to build a factory in Gruenheide, located in the eastern state of Brandenburg.

The ruling by the higher administrative court of the states of Berlin and Brandenburg comes shortly after the state environmental office gave Tesla permission to clear 92 hectares of forest to make room for the new manufacturing plant. However, the planning permission for the factory had not yet been granted meaning that preparing the ground for the factory was done at the company’s own risk.

The court stated that it would have taken Tesla only three more days to clear the area of trees which accelerated the issuing of the order. If the order to stop clearing trees had not been issued, the work would have been completed before the judges made a final decision on a complaint brought by a local environmentalist group called the Gruene Liga Brandenburg (Green League of Brandenburg).

“It should not be assumed that the motion seeking legal protection brought by the Green League lacks any chance of succeeding,” the court statement added. Lawmakers from the Christian Democrat and Free Democrat parties have warned that the legal battle against the Gigafactroy could inflict long-lasting damage on Germany’s image as a place to do business.

Lawmakers appear to be surprised by the strength of the opposition towards the Gigafactroy with hundreds of demonstrators protesting what they say is the threat it poses to local wildlife and water supplies.

418,UK: Rochdale Rapist Jailed After Police Find Child-Sized Bras in Lockbox,['Kurt Zindulka'],"A child rapist in Rochdale has been jailed after police discovered child-sized bras and a USB drive containing obscene images of young girls believed to be as young as seven-years-old.

Samiral Choudhury, 30, was sentenced to seven years and two months in prison after he confessed to having committed voyeurism, sexually penetrating a child under the age of 13 and sexual assault of a child under 13.

Choudhury was first arrested by police in Rochdale after a kilo of cocaine was found in his vehicle in 2017, which he was later sentenced to four years in prison for intent to distribute a class A drug. During the inspection of his car, police discovered a key to a metal lockbox in his flat, that was found to contain ten child-sized bras and a USB stick containing pornographic images of pre-pubescent girls reports the Manchester Evening News.

“The bras are described by an officer as training bras used by young girls who are just starting to develop breasts during puberty”, said the prosecutor in the case, Simon Blakeborough.

The convicted rapist did not comment on the underwear during the trial, however, officers believe that they were trophies taken from his victims.

Another ‘Asian’ Child Rape Gang Convicted in England https://t.co/S3TCrrEtLD — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 25, 2019

On Choudhury’s phone police discovered a 48-second video clip in which a child believed to be between the age of seven and ten-years-old was sexually abused. Two pictures of a young girl having her breasts molested by a man were also found on the phone.

The paedophile initially disputed the charges against him, claiming that the flash drive was used for work and that his colleagues had access to it, yet forensic evidence debunked this claim.

Specialists in the police force used one of the videos on his phone to identify the fingerprints of the man molesting a child, which turned out to belong to Choudhury.

It is believed that it is only the second time that such technology was used to secure a conviction by the Greater Manchester Police, however, the police say they plan to use it more in the future as the quality of cameras in phones improve.

As a part of Choudhury’s sentence, he will be prohibited from having unmonitored contact with children under the age of 16 and will be subject to police surveillance of his internet-connected devices after he is released from prison.

Though he has been given a sentence of seven years and two months, it is unclear how much of this must be served in custody rather than ‘on licence in the community’.

“The sentence imposed by the court today highlights the justice system’s commitment to protecting children from predatory and shameful behaviour,” said Detective Constable Adam Cronshaw, of GMP’s Serious Crime Division.

“Choudhury is not only a convicted drug dealer but now a convicted paedophile too,” he said, adding: “Sexual offences often have a life-long impact on victims. We are 100 per cent committed to bringing those responsible for these shocking crimes to justice”.

419,Viktor Orbán Proclaims ‘Hungary First’ in State-of-the-Nation Speech,['Thomas D. Williams'],"Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán recited a litany of successes in his state-of-the-nation address Sunday, arguing that “the last ten years were the most successful ten years in Hungary’s last 100 years.”

“With due modesty,” Mr. Orbán declared to the crowd at Budapest’s Várkert Bazár, “we figured out what to do and we did it,” citing an average 2.8 percent annual GDP growth rate since 2010 and an average of 3.4 percent since 2013.

According to economic reports released in Brussels this week, Mr. Orbán noted, “in 2019 the Hungarian economy registered the highest growth rate on the whole continent.”

Hungary has maintained steady growth while keeping wealth inequality at a moderate level by European standards, he said, noting that Hungary’s broader society has benefited from the country’s growth.

The Prime Minister said that even the country’s more vulnerable demographic groups such as young people, workers over 50, mothers, and low-skilled workers have all been able to find jobs, and that wages had increased significantly.

Referring to the early payoff of loans, Orbán said his administration had “sent the IMF home” while managing to create 850,000 jobs, put the country’s finances in order, and move toward “a reunification of the nation.”

The Prime Minister also made reference to new alliances with neighbouring Slovakia, Serbia, Croatia, and Slovenia, while also insisting that “our nation knows that Hungary comes first.”

“History has again given central European peoples a chance to build a new alliance based on their own national interests, allowing us to defend ourselves against threats from both the east and the west,” Mr. Orbán said.

As is his wont, the Prime Minister also found occasion to criticize the pretensions of the European Union.

“Over the past ten years we also learned that Europe is not in Brussels,” the prime minister said. “Europe is us and we don’t have to please the tired Brussels elites. In the past we used to think that Europe was our future but today we know that we are the future of Europe.”

“The debate has been going on for ten years as to how they should evaluate our economic and social model,” Orbán said, adding that “one cannot even say in the liberal, Brussels euro-blabla language what is happening in Hungary.”

Noting that it was a government of former communists that had made Hungary go bust with their liberal politics, Orbán quipped that “a liberal is nothing but than a communist with a diploma.”

“Europe’s economy, and in particular the euro zone region, has simply stalled,” Orbán said, while noting that 85 percent of Hungary’s exports has gone to those countries. “This means that their problem is our problem,” he said.

Moreover, he said, in Europe today “the rights of violent criminals have become more important to decision makers than those of law-abiding citizens.”

“They mock justice, the life instincts of honest people and are ready to defend perpetrators instead of victims,” he said.

Foreign-funded organizations backed by U.S. billionaire George Soros “and their hired lawyers are filing a myriad of lawsuits, abusing the protection of rights,” Orbán said.

“In 2015,” Orbán said, “human trafficking groups disguised as human rights organizations allowed waves of migrants into Europe.” They were, of course, “financed by George Soros.”

Maintaining and modernizing jobs will remain an important goal for Hungary in 2020, Mr. Orbán said, adding that he intends to cut payroll taxes as well as taxes on small businesses.

This past week the Orbán administration rolled out a climate protection plan that includes eliminating illegal waste sites and penalizing polluters.

Under the plan, ten new trees will be planted for every newborn baby in Hungary, Orbán noted Sunday, and by 2030 the proportion of the country’s forest area will be increased to 27 percent.

420,London Bloodbath: Three Men Stabbed Within 90 Minutes of Each Other,['Kurt Zindulka'],"Three people are in life-threatening condition, including a 15-year-old boy, after a series of stabbings took place within the span of 90 minutes across London.

London police were called to Barking in East London, where a man in his 30s was attacked with a knife. The attack is being linked to another knife attack that occurred soon after in neighbouring Dagenham, leaving a 19-year-old man hospitalised. So far, two men have been arrested for attempted murder in connection to the attacks.

Another victim, a 15-year-old boy, was stabbed with a knife at around 5:15 pm after being dragged from his moped in Hackney. The attack, which is believed to have been gang-related, left the boy in critical condition with a massive wound to the head, reports the Evening Standard.

“We were looking out the window and the boy was on the floor, one of the neighbours was there with him too and police officers were surrounding him. There was a helmet in the middle of the road, he was dragged off his bike and stabbed,” a local resident said.

“I have a 15-year-old too so it is worrying. There seems to be stabbings everyday but it is a shock when it happens on your doorstep,” another resident said.

During the tenure of London Mayor Sadiq Khan, the capital has been plagued by knife crime. An analysis from London Assembly’s Conservatives claimed that following Khan’s election in 2016, knife crime has risen by 52 per cent in the city.

Last year in London there was a total of 149 homicides, the highest murder rate in a decade. The majority of murders were committed with knives, with 90 people being stabbed to death, compared to 55 just five years earlier.

421,Greece Scraps Plans to Build Emergency Migrant Detention Camps,['Breitbart London'],"ATHENS, Greece (AP) – Greece’s government says it is suspending an emergency plan to build migrant detention camps on Greek islands near the Turkish coast to allow for negotiations with local authorities who strongly oppose the move.

Notis Mitarakis, the migration affairs minister, said Monday the plan announced last week has been put on hold until demands by authorities on the islands of Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos are discussed.

The government says it wants to replace existing overcrowded camps with closed facilities and has already issued land appropriation orders. But islanders staged protests against the proposed construction – setting up roadblocks on Lesbos – amid fears that the new sites would place an additional burden on their small communities.

Under a 2016 agreement between the European Union and Turkey, Lesbos and the four other islands have been used as natural barriers for migrants and refugees trying to reach the mainland of EU member Greece. That has resulted in serious overcrowding at the existing island camps and living conditions for migrants that U.N. officials have called horrific.",https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/02/17/greece-scraps-plans-to-build-emergency-migrant-detention-camps/
422,Franklin Graham: LGBTQ Activists ‘Intolerant of Traditional Christianity’,['Thomas D. Williams'],"Prominent evangelical pastor Franklin Graham said Sunday that LGBTQ activists are trying to ban “the truth of the Gospel” from British society by having him barred from preaching in the UK.

In parallel posts on Facebook and Twitter, Rev. Graham lamented efforts “by LGBTQ activists” to have his eight-city evangelistic tour across the UK cancelled.

“Opposition to the Gospel shouldn’t really surprise us. Jesus warned that it would come,” Graham wrote. “As you may know, my eight-city evangelistic tour across the UK has been met with resistance by LGBTQ activists who inaccurately claim that I am homophobic, Islamophobic, and say that I speak hate.”

“Anyone who knows me or has heard me speak knows that this really isn’t true — but, I DO preach the TRUTH of the Gospel. Could it be, rather, that these folks are truthophobic or free-speech-ophobic?” Graham asks.

Like many Christians, Rev. Graham has not hesitated to voice his disagreement with the 2015 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to impose same-sex marriage on the nation in Obergefell v. Hodges. Appealing to biblical morality, Graham has continued to assert that marriage is the union of one man and one woman, which was the predominant belief of humanity for all of history.

In his dissent from Obergefell, Justice Samuel Alito presciently wrote that the decision would be used to hurt Americans who may not share a contemporary view of marriage as a malleable, fluid arrangement between an unspecified number of unspecified persons.

“It will be used to vilify Americans who are unwilling to assent to the new orthodoxy,” he wrote.

In his Facebook post Sunday, Rev. Graham cites Australian Martyn Iles who asks if society “has become so ‘tolerant’ that it is now intolerant of mainstream Christianity.”

“This is really a fight for truth, and the Gospel is what is really being ‘banned’ from these venues,” Graham writes. “It really boils down to the fact that they disagree with the message.”

Speaking the truth of Christianity to people, even when the message is unwelcome, is “love speech,” Graham asserts, the opposite of hate speech.

423,WEF: ‘Birds Are Shrinking’ Because of Climate Change,['Thomas D. Williams'],"Birds and other animals are “shrinking” because of climate change, the World Economic Forum (WEF) announced Monday.

Citing a recent article published in Ecology Letters, the WEF posted a video claiming that climate change is causing birds and other animals to shrink in size, while birds’ wings are simultaneously getting longer.

“Scientists say birds are shrinking because of climate change,” states the text of the video. “Researchers looked at more than 70,000 North American birds and found that over 40 years most have got smaller while their wingspans have grown longer.”

“Scientists think smaller bodies help the birds keep cool but this means they have less energy so they need bigger wings to compensate,” the WEF proposed.

“Experts think global warming is causing other animals to shrink, too, including species such as mountain goats, fish, salamanders, and wasps—all getting smaller as the planet heats up,” the text continues.

“This is affecting feeding habits and the availability of food and changing behavior. So limiting global warming is vital to avoiding further damage to our wildlife,” it concludes.

Without entering into the merits of the study upon which the video is based, two queries immediately come to mind.

First, the video suggests that the birds are getting smaller because smaller bodies help them to “keep cool,” but then goes on to propose that the same phenomenon is occurring among other animals including fish — which are cold-blooded. How is that possible?

Second, the video concludes by asserting that global warming must be limited to avoid “further damage” to wildlife.

What exactly is the damage here?, one would like to ask WEF. Is all biological evolution “damage”? Do animals historically become worse by adapting to natural habitats and climatological change? Why is all change assumed to be a loss?

It would seem, rather, that the knee-jerk reaction of many of our contemporaries is to assume that any alterations in nature must necessarily be the result of climate change and must also necessarily be bad. This is never proven, of course, just assumed.

If the climate change lobby would like more people to get on board with their crusade, they would do well to offer a little more science and a little less ideological propaganda.

424,"Globalist Magazine: Less Migration Makes Americans Richer, Economy Stronger",['Neil Munro'],"Lower migration is driving up blue collar wages, and those extra wages are stabilizing the U.S. economy, says the Economist magazine, which serves as a community newspaper for globalist elites.

The admission of rising prosperity comes in a sour-toned February 13 article, and is buried under multiple warnings about future disasters:

There are nonetheless scraps of evidence that some workers are benefiting from America’s growing antipathy to immigrants. Gordon Hanson of Harvard University suggests that if the impact of reduced low-skill migration is showing up anywhere, it will be in three particular occupations: housekeepers, building-and-grounds maintenance workers, and drywall installers. These occupations rely heavily on immigrant labour and the services they provide cannot be traded internationally. Average wages in those occupations are rising considerably faster than wages in other low-paid jobs, according to calculations by The Economist.

The Economist article is headlined “Delayed reaction: Immigration to America is down. Wages are up.”

It provides more good news — that President Donald Trump’s Hire America’ policy is even boosting wages in the midwest:

Intriguing evidence also shows up geographically. According to research by William Frey of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank, five big metro areas saw absolute declines in their foreign-born populations in 2010-18. Wages in those areas are now rising by 5% a year, according to our calculations. Cleveland, which is in one such area, has pockets of severe poverty but seems to be doing better than before. Many of the city centre’s astonishingly grand buildings are being converted into luxury lofts for millennials.

The Economist article ends with a dour warning: “The Trump administration’s immigration restrictionism may achieve a temporary boost in wages of the low-paid now, but at a cost to the country’s future prosperity.”

But even the warnings were full of good news about how higher wages are forcing companies to invest in the labor-saving machinery which allows Americans to get more work done in less time:

In the short term, native workers may well see a wage boost as labour supply falls. But businesses then reorient production towards less labour-intensive products; natives take jobs previously occupied by foreign-born folk, which may be worse paid; and bosses invest in labour-saving machinery, which can reduce the pay of remaining workers.

If the Economist is correct, Americans will get new robots in their factories, cow milking machines on their farms, and job offers from Silicon Valley firms and New York restaurants.

The first term success by Trump — and by the voters who put him into office — is torture for pro-migration groups who have long insisted Americans somehow gain when migrants swell the number of jobs in the economy by entering U.S. job sites and housing markets.

But an increasing number of experts are grudgingly admitting a reduction in migrants boosts Americans’ average wages, the government’s tax receipts, and politicians’ reelection votes.

The pro-American lesson has been admitted by independent academics, the National Academies of Science, the Congressional Budget Office, executives, more academics, New York Times reporters, state officials, unions, more business executives, lobbyists, employees, the Wall Street Journal, federal economists, Goldman Sachs, oil drillers, Wall Street analysts, fired professionals, legislators, construction workers, New York Times subscribers, Robert Rubin, and even by the Bank of Ireland.

The Economist also published a second February 13 article admitting Trump’s “Blue Collar Boom” is powering the economy through routine dips and dives:

AT 128 MONTHS and counting, America’s economic expansion is the longest on record. Longevity has not come easily. The expansion trundled along despite global manufacturing downturns in 2016 and 2019, conflicts over trade, and a bout of monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve. The recovery ploughed ahead last year even as business investment decelerated and residential-construction investment shrank, thanks to rock-steady growth in personal consumption. The durability of spending is a testament to one of this expansion’s more unusual features: faster growth in wages for workers at the bottom of the income distribution than for high earners. Improved fortunes for low-wage workers may, it seems, be an underappreciated contributor to the sustainability of economic booms.

The wages gain by blue collar Americans will help avoid another disastrous 2008 crash, says the Economist:

The recent recovery looks very different from the pattern established in the 1990s and 2000s. From 2014 to 2018 pay in low-wage industries grew about as quickly as that in other parts of the economy, according to a recent analysis by economists at Indeed Hiring Lab, a labour-market research group. And over the past two years wage growth at the bottom has been substantially faster than that in better-paying industries (see chart). Rising pay for low earners has put more cash in the hands of those most likely to spend, supporting consumption and helping the economy weather a soft patch.

In the early 2000s, GOP President George W. Bush raised immigration levels, lowered wages and cut interest rates. That mixture produced a housing boom as many migrants bought houses. But their wages were too low pay their mortgages once the economy dipped in 2007, ensuring a massive economic crash, the Economist said.

The Economist is a pro-globalist publication that favors companies and investors, and so it supports the mass migration of unskilled and skilled workers into the United States and Europe. Its recognition that reduced migration can benefit a nation’s citizens and their economy is a notable win for Trump’s populist voters.

But the Economist articles said little about the huge level of white collar immigration into the United States which has devastated college graduate careers and salaries from New York to California:

The number of highly qualified immigrants continues to rise. San Francisco airport remains just as crammed with Allbirds-and-gilet-wearing tech investors from all over the world.

So far, American graduates have yet to see any cutback in white collar migration, or a boom from Trump’s Hire American, pro-American, economic policies.",https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/02/19/the-economist-globalist-magazine-yes-lower-migration-means-high-wages/
425,Jeff Bezos Creates $10 Billion Fund to Combat Climate Change,['David Ng'],"Amazon CEO and world’s richest man Jeff Bezos has announced that he is creating a $10 billion fund to combat climate change, calling it the “biggest threat to our planet.”

Bezos, who reportedly owns a Gulfstream G650ER private jet, made the announcement via Instagram on Monday. He said the Bezos Earth Fund will begin giving out grants this summer, with the money going toward supporting activists, scientists, and non-governmental organizations.

“Climate change is the biggest threat to our planet. I want to work alongside others both to amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change on this planet we all share,” he wrote in the Instagram post.

“Earth is the one thing we all have in common — let’s protect it, together.⁣⁣⁣”

Bezos announced last year that he is committing Amazon to meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement ten years early. The online retailer claims it will transition to zero emissions by 2030 and will add 100,000 electric delivery vehicles to its fleet by 2024.

Amazon is expected to procure the electric vehicles from Rivian, the automotive company in which Amazon has invested a reported $440 million.

Bezos reportedly purchased his Gulfstream private jet for $65 million. The aircraft seats eight people and has been used by the tech billionaire to make multiple trips to the Washington, D.C. area, where Amazon has established a new headquarters in northern Virginia.

The Washington Post revealed last year that the jet embarked on more than a dozen flights a month in 2018, many of them coming from or going to Seattle. The destinations include Los Angeles, Boston, Dallas, Miami, and New York.

Last year, Bloomberg reported that Amazon’s carbon footprint contributed more greenhouse gas emissions in 2018 than some big competitors in retail, logistics and technology, though less than rival Walmart.

426,“Fight Back!’ Elizabeth Warren Brings Urgent Message to Nevada Caucuses,['Joel B. Pollak'],"HENDERSON, Nevada — Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) told supporters at a town hall Monday afternoon to “fight back” against President Donald Trump.

“What do you do when people are afraid, when the danger is real?” she asked, citing examples of people who, she said, were in danger because of President Donald Trump.

“Do we back down? Do we cower? Or do we fight back? Me, I’m fighting back … Fighting back is an act of patriotism!”

Warren’s campaign held the “Get-Out-the-Caucus” (GOTC) event during early voting as part of a final push in the Silver State. About 200-300 supporters came to hear her at the College of Southern Nevada.

The Massachusetts U.S. Senator is competitive in the state, thanks to a strong grassroots presence. As of late summer 2019, she had the most offices of any Democratic campaign in the 2020 presidential fight.

But the fight, in Nevada, has become “do-or-die” for Warren, after she finished third in the Iowa caucuses and a distant fourth in the New Hampshire primary last week.

Her local campaign also suffered the departure of several “women of color,” who complained about the work environment.

If she fails to finish in the top three in Nevada, her campaign may not be “leaving Las Vegas,” as the saying goes — though the candidate herself appears confident that she can continue to the South Carolina primary and beyond, and is already campaigning in other states ahead of the Feb. 22 caucus.

On Monday, Warren emphasized that she is the hardest-fighting candidate in the race, with supporters holding signs that read “Dream Big, Fight Hard.”

But that may not have been the message undecided voters wanted to hear.

Gina, from Las Vegas — who described herself as “60% Elizabeth, 40% Amy [Klobuchar]” — said prior to the event that she was worried that Warren’s brand of politics might provoke the Republican base.

Warren, she said, “has everything that I want, but I think Amy is a uniter.”

She added: “There are so many reasons to be angry, especially at Trump, but we need someone who can serve everybody and appeal to moderates on the other side.”

Warren drew cheers when talking about her proposal for a wealth tax, and earned some laughs when she joked about some lights in the room flickering out.

“I think a billionaire just turned out my lights,” she said.

She added: “Nevertheless, I persist!” The crowd roared.

Others liked her economic message.

Matt, from Henderson, said he was undecided and came to the event to “hear a little bit more” from Warren before making up his mind.

“I’m concerned with the fact that I’m in my 40s and have to live with my parents,” he said. “There are positions created on paper that are never filled, or give you no chance of a livable wage.”

Asked what he thought of President Trump’s claims about a strong economy, Matt said it was a “great mask,” arguing that while the stock market was doing well, he knew many people working “anywhere from two to three jobs.”

“I was raised by my grandfather to believe that you should have one job that trains you, that hires you, and that take cares of you in retirement,” he said.

He suggested Warren could win him over if she promised to go after corporate corruption.

Which she did.

427,Michael Bloomberg Floated Cuts to Social Security and Medicare in 2011,['Charlie Spiering'],"Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg once floated supporting cuts to Social Security and Medicare, despite criticizing President Trump with the false claim that he would do so.

“When he was running for office, Donald Trump promised not to touch Social Security, and yet as president, he’s proposed cuts,” Bloomberg said Sunday. “When I’m in the White House, I will keep my word to seniors and to the American people.”

During his campaign for president, Trump repeatedly distanced himself from Republicans such as Rep. Paul Ryan, who told Americans that cuts in Social Security and Medicare were essential to the long-term strength of the programs.

But Bloomberg embraced that kind of rhetoric in an interview with Fox News Sunday in 2011.

“We cannot continue to say we’ve got to cut, but we can’t touch Medicare and Medicaid, Social Security, defense,” Bloomberg said in the interview. “That’s virtually 90 percent of all of our spending.”

Democrats have falsely claimed that in a recent interview with CNBC, President Trump signaled he was open to cuts to Social Security and Medicare.

“We’re not touching Medicare,” Trump told United States governors last week. “We want to keep Medicare. We’re not touching Social Security. … We’re not decreasing Medicaid.”",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/17/michael-bloomberg-floated-cuts-social-security-medicare-2011/
428,Mark Zuckerberg Calls for Government Regulation of Social Media,['Lucas Nolan'],"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for more regulation surrounding online content, saying that it’s not up to social media companies to determine free speech.

BBC News reports that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg warned during the Munich Security Conference in Germany that excessive control of speech online risked stifling individual expression and free speech. Social media services such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have been put under intense pressure to crack down on “hate speech” online, Facebook has also been harshly criticized for its refusal to fact check political ads.

Zuckerberg stated during the conference that he supported government regulation of speech online stating: “We don’t want private companies making so many decisions about how to balance social equities without any more democratic process.”

Zuckerberg urged governments to develop regulations relating to social media and suggested that a new regulatory system be founded that combined the existing rules for telecoms and media companies. “In the absence of that kind of regulation we will continue doing our best,” he said.

Zuckerberg continued: “But I actually think on a lot of these questions that are trying to balance different social equities it is not just about coming up with the right answer, it is about coming up with an answer that society thinks is legitimate.”

Zuckerberg stated that Facebook now has a team of 35,000 people reviewing content and security on the platform, he stated that with assistance from AI the social media site deletes more than one million fake Facebook accounts every day. “Our budget [for content review] is bigger today than the whole revenue of the company when we went public in 2012, when we had a billion users,” Zuckerberg said.

429,"Michael Bloomberg Belittled Farmers, Machinists: Not Much ‘Gray Matter'",['Haris Alic'],"Presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg once claimed that farming and manufacturing jobs required little brainpower compared to the information economy, where the former New York City mayor made billions.

Bloomberg, who is under fire after a string of old sexist and racially insensitive remarks resurfaced on social media last week, made the belittling comments at a 2016 Oxford University forum in England. During the forum, the former mayor asserted that a major obstacle to uniting America’s heartland with the coasts was the inability of blue-collar workers to transition into the information economy.

“I could teach anybody, even people in this room, no offense intended, to be a farmer,” Bloomberg said. “It’s a process. You dig a hole, you put a seed in, you put dirt on top, add water, up comes the corn. You could learn that.”

“Then we had 300 years of the industrial society,” he continued. “You put the piece of metal on the lathe, you turn the crank in the direction of the arrow, and you can have a job.”

Bloomberg proceeded to argue that with the advancement of the information economy, individuals who would have prospered in the old industrial and farming jobs are now at a disadvantage because they lack adequate education and intellect.

“Now comes the information economy and [it] is fundamentally different because it’s built around replacing people with technology and the skill sets that you have to learn are how to think and analyze, and that is a whole degree level different,” he said. “You have to have a different skill set, you have to have a lot more gray matter.”

Bloomberg added that it was unclear if the skills or “gray matter” required for such high-skilled jobs could be easily taught in schools, so the “challenge of society” was figuring out how to provide for those locked out of the information economy.

When the comments first began circulating on social media this weekend they elicited a strong rebuke from both the right and the left.

The revelations come as the former mayor is already facing scrutiny for his position on policing and race issues after audio resurfaced from a speech he gave at the Aspen Institute in 2015. In his remarks to the mostly white gathering, Bloomberg defended “stop-and-frisk” in words that can only be described as racially charged.

“It’s controversial, but … 95 percent of your murders, and murderers, and murder victims fit one [description],” he is heard to say on the audio. “You can just take the description, Xerox it, and pass it out to all of the cops.

French foreign minister and close ally to President Emmanuel Macron, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said on Sunday that “everyone is going to defend their interests” in the coming trade negotiations, but clearly signalled that the national interests of the different parties would lead to fractious negotiations.

The statesman said: “I think that on trade issues or on the measures for our future relationship that we are going to discuss, we are going to start on, we are going to rip each other apart.

Delingpole: I’m Right – Brexit On WTO Terms Is Going to Be Just Great for Britain https://t.co/gjsFkf7Ui3 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 27, 2019

While the United Kingdom technically departed the European Union at the end of January 2020, it continues to trade as a full member of the Union and follow the bloc’s rules for as long as it remains in the so-called transition period. This means in practice, it is unlikely Britain will actually become an independent nation until the end of December 2020, although there is a mechanism to extend the period even further.

European leaders want to keep the United Kingdom tied as closely as possible to the European Union, forcing it to accept the continuing supremacy of EU rules in return for maintaining the status quo on cross-border trade, or something close to it. The problem faced by the British government is continuing to accept EU rules in return for trade means Britain will never really leave the European Union.

Nonetheless, while the French government predicts calamity the UK insists cutting a deal need not be that complicated, and should resemble ones already struck by the EU with other nations like Canada. A spokesman for the Prime Minister said: “Our approach is clear – we are not asking for anything special, bespoke or unique, but are looking for a deal like those the EU has struck previously with other friendly countries like Canada.

“We want a relationship based on friendly cooperation between sovereign equals, one centred on free trade and inspired by our shared history and values.”

Yet the EU’s top negotiator Michel Barnier has insisted the UK must continue to surrender its rights to control fishing in its own territorial waters in return for a trade deal.

431,Eurocrats ‘Fighting Like Ferrets in a Sack’ over Brexit Budget Hole,['Victoria Friedman'],"European leaders are said to be “fighting like ferrets in a sack” over how to fill the €12 billion annual hole left by the UK’s exit from the EU.

When the UK left the EU on January 31st, the bloc was faced with the multi-billion pound budgetary black hole and will have to look elsewhere to fill it. The bloc’s other rich countries, like Denmark and the Netherlands, will likely have to fill the gaps whilst Brussels makes cutbacks to the subsidies of its poorer member states.

However, whilst aware that the UK was set to leave the EU, Brussels proposed in May 2018 to increase its Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) from €1 trillion in the period 2014-2020 to €1.25 trillion in the period to 2027, exasperating the super-state’s dilemma. The EU has committed to a host of expensive endeavours, including developing an EU army, new migration management plans, its green agenda, and expansionism, which will result in more economically under-developed nations needing subsidies.

The UK was the third-largest contributor to the EU budget, and with the shortfall, one EU diplomatic source told The Guardian that European politicians preparing for the MFF are squabbling amongst themselves as to how to fill it.

“And now we are fighting like ferrets in a sack,” the diplomat said.

One senior EU official told the newspaper: “In this negotiation, we are not expecting member states to be happy, but the degree of dissatisfaction will be key.”

However, one diplomat from “the Frugals” responded: “No chance.”

432,Boris's border blueprint: Immigration revolution will end cheap foreign labour,"['David Barrett Home Affairs Correspondent', 'David Barrett Home Affairs Correspondent For The Daily Mail']","Migrants from the EU will have to speak English and have a job offer under sweeping reforms to end Britain's reliance on cheap European labour.

The measures are part of the biggest shake-up to border rules since this country joined the Common Market in 1973.

Low-skilled immigration will be made virtually impossible under a points-based system as free movement rights are consigned to history.

Instead, EU migrants' chances of getting a work visa will be the same as for applicants from elsewhere.

They will need at least 70 points to work in Britain, with points awarded for speaking English, if the job earns a salary above £25,600 and if it is at a certain skill level.

Last night, Home Secretary Priti Patel (pictured) said she had listened to the 'clear message' from the 2016 Brexit referendum and the 2019 General Election that the public wanted 'a reduction in low-skilled immigration'

Highly skilled workers – such as scientists – will be able to come without a job offer as the Government re-aligns the immigration system to the 'brightest and the best'. But there will be no general visas for low-skilled migrants.

Last night, Home Secretary Priti Patel said she had listened to the 'clear message' from the 2016 Brexit referendum and the 2019 General Election that the public wanted 'a reduction in low-skilled immigration'.

'Today we set out our historic blueprint for taking back control of our borders,' she said. 'It is the biggest shake-up of our immigration system in a generation and is what the public rightly demand.'

Home Office officials warned that businesses would have to wean themselves off cheap labour from the Continent.

They will need at least 70 points to work in Britain, with points awarded for speaking English, if the job earns a salary above £25,600 and if it is at a certain skill level

Instead, employers will be encouraged to recruit from Britain's pool of 1.3million unemployed, or pay higher wages to ensure they retain existing staff.

However, there was an immediate backlash last night with some industry leaders warning that the plans spelled 'absolute disaster' for the care system, and for farmers, builders and the hospitality sector.

The announcement also opens up the prospect of a rush of EU migrants coming to Britain by the end of the year.

Any EU citizens living in Britain by New Year's Eve will be entitled to live and work here under current rules. The reforms, which will come into force in January, will:

Limit EU nationals without a visa to a maximum of six months in Britain;

Bar all new migrants, including Europeans, from claiming income-related benefits;

Allow EU travellers to carry on using the current 'UK and EU' e-gates at ports and airports – although this will be 'kept under review';

Force all migrants, including those from the EU, who come here to work to pay towards the NHS – currently set at £400 a year;

All migrants will have to earn at least £25,600 a year and must hold an offer for a job which meets the 'skills test' equivalent to A-levels.

The minimum salary is flexible, however, and an applicant could be set to earn as little as £20,480 a year if they meet other criteria – such as filling a job where there are shortages, such as nursing.

All successful migrants will still be able to bring dependants such as spouses and children with them.

434,ROBERT HARDMAN: The Queen loves Harry and Meghan...but she has to stand firm,"['Robert Hardman', 'Robert Hardman For The Daily Mail']","From the moment that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their intention to renounce royal duties for a more 'progressive role' overseas, one thing was never in doubt: that 'Sussex Royal' brand would have to go.

It might have sounded just fine and dandy to the team of super-slick US rights agents, intellectual property lawyers and digital marketing experts flocking to advise the couple on their new modus operandi.

But it was never going to meet with the approval of the ultimate arbiter on all things royal – the Queen.

The only surprising thing is that this may have come as a surprise to the Sussexes themselves.

From the earliest age, Harry has been raised on the sanctity of the 'brand' which has come to define his existence.

Almost no one else on Earth has grown up thinking it perfectly normal that both parents should have their own individual standards to be flown above whichever residence or vehicle they happened to occupy at any given moment.

The couple's decision to step down as senior working royals and pursue 'financial independence' put a spanner in the Sussex Royal works and placed the Queen in an invidious position

Whenever his grandmother undertakes the most important of all her constitutional duties – the State Opening of Parliament – she is preceded by the heralds of the College of Arms, custodians of all things heraldic (from coats of arms to flags).

The very thought of labelling the monarchy as a brand may appal staunch royalists. However, in this case, the analogy is not just relevant but crucial to the argument.

For the definition of what is and what is not 'royal' is not just a matter of regal whim. The Queen is actually governed by several pieces of legislation, including the Trade Marks Act 1994 and even the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property of 1883.

The Sussexes have not picked a fight with the Queen but with the law of the land.

Since time immemorial, people have attempted to trade on royal connections, which is why there have long been strict rules governing everything from the use of the Royal Arms to the use of crowns on cereal packets.

It is not a case of monarchs jealously guarding the perks of office, it is about protecting the public from fraud and misrepresentation.

No monarch wants someone buying faulty goods or being taken for a ride by some huckster claiming some sort of bogus royal provenance.

It was for precisely that reason that the Royal Warrant Holders Association came in to being in the 19th century.

Harry and Meghan have spent tens of thousands of pounds on a new Sussex Royal website, sussexroyal.com, to complement their hugely popular Instagram feed. It has now been made clear that they will need to 're-brand'

To this day, royal warrants are granted to companies which must have supplied the Royal Household over a period of several years. If royal custom ceases, then so does the warrant. They are not bought or sold.

Nor are they a company asset – they are registered to an individual at the company.

Now, Harry and Meghan may have, very understandably, assumed that their own 'royal' credentials are beyond reproach, as indeed they are.

After all, they retain the style of HRH, even if they will not use it.

But what applies personally to a member of the family does not apply to what is very clearly a commercial enterprise.

The Sussexes 'get' the importance of brand protection, which is why they have been so busy registering 'Sussex Royal' for every sort of potential commercial use (including, we are told, pyjamas).

So they can hardly object when the Queen and her officials, representing an institution which has been protecting its own brand for centuries, lay down what is very well-established law to protect their own 'intellectual property'.

Perhaps Harry and Meghan should switch their attention from their own elegantly constructed website to the rather more arcane recesses of the official Royal Household website.

There, they will find exhaustive guidance from the Lord Chamberlain's Office on how businesses can lay claim to any sort of 'royal' status. Much of it, in any case, is governed not by the Palace but by the Cabinet Office.

In other words, Harry and Meghan are going to have to square their plans with Michael Gove as well as Granny.

The official royal website might not have the beautiful arty shots like those on sussexroyal.com, but it is pretty precise.

For example: 'Sections 55 and 1047 of the Companies Act 2006 and Regulation 8 of the Limited Liability Partnerships (Application of Companies Act 2006) Regulations 2009 prohibits companies (including overseas companies)… from being registered under a name which includes any of the sensitive words specified in the Company, Limited Liability Partnership and Business Names (Sensitive Words and Expressions) Regulations 2014, unless the approval of the Secretary of State has been obtained.'

The sensitive words specified in the 2014 Regulations include Royal, Queen, King…

Hours before leaving for his new life in Vancouver last month, the Duke of Sussex made that downcast speech at a dinner for his charity, Sentebale.

In it, he spoke of his 'sadness' at the rejection of his plans to carve out a new, privately funded semi-royal existence.

It was his reply to the statement from the Queen the previous day in which she had voiced her love and support for the couple in their attempts to create 'a happy and peaceful new life'.

It was widely seen as a rather churlish riposte, particularly given the generosity of the Queen's words at such a delicate time.

Let there be no more such grumbling. The Queen's love for her grandson and his wife has not changed one jot.

This issue, however, is just business. Clamping down on 'Sussex Royal' comes under the heading of 'duty' not 'family'.

The Queen's father had to make some very difficult decisions when his brother, the former Edward VIII, abandoned ship in 1936.

This situation is nothing like the Abdication Crisis, of course, but it is every monarch's duty, first and foremost, to protect the Crown.

The Queen is not completely immovable with regard to her 'brand'. She is very sensible and often very generous.

Come the big royal moments such as jubilees, for example, she will announce an amnesty on use of the royal arms, allowing souvenir manufacturers a free run in producing all manner of commemorative tat – from biscuit tins to loo roll – for a specific period.

But that certainly does not mean a permanent free-for-all.

Of course, Harry and Meghan should be given time to reconfigure their new ventures.

And, of course, there will be a few grey areas and misunderstandings in the years ahead.

But the overarching rule remains the same: the royal imprimatur – and all that it entails – must always remain exclusively in the hands of the Sovereign.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-8018137/ROBERT-HARDMAN-Queen-loves-Harry-Meghan-stand-firm.html
435,National Theatre's artistic director says it will be 'business as usual' for patron Meghan Markle,"['Bryony Jewell', 'Bryony Jewell For Mailonline']","Meghan Markle is thought to have told the National Theatre that her role as a patron will be 'business as usual' despite now living in Canada.

Artistic director Rufus Norris explained that although bosses were not told of the Duchess of Sussex's plans to move, they are confident she will remain 'engaged' and are looking forward to working with her and her 'star reach'.

It comes after the Queen and senior officials are believed to have agreed it is no longer tenable for the couple to keep the word 'royal' in their 'branding'.

Meghan Markle, 38, is thought to have promised the National Theatre that her role as a patron, which she has held since January 2019, will be 'business as usual' despite now living in Canada with Prince Harry and their son Archie (the Duke and Duchess are pictured in January)

The Mail understands that, amid what has been described as a 'complex' situation, the 'fine detail' is still being thrashed out.

Mr Norris was seen with Meghan shortly before her move to Canada was announced and she is set to meet with theatre bosses during a short trip to the UK in March.

Mr Norris told The Telegraph: 'There has been no indication at all from her that her engagement with us would be anything other than business as usual.

'She has proven to be a very engaged patron and we look forward to working with her. She has star reach, she understands the nature of what we’re trying to do.'

He added that despite reports theatre bosses were 'fuming' after Meghan and Harry announced they would be leaving the UK, this was a 'total fiction', reports The Times.

Meghan was made a patron of the National Theatre in January 2019. At the same time she also took on honorary roles with Mayhew, Smart Works, and the Association of Commonwealth Universities.

Artistic Director Rufus Norris (pictured) said Meghan has 'proven to be a very engaged patron' who 'has star reach'

On Wednesday it was revealed the Duke and Duchess of Sussex must drop their 'Sussex Royal' label after deciding to step down as working royals.

Following lengthy and complex talks, the Queen and senior officials are believed to have agreed it is no longer tenable for the couple to keep the word 'royal' in their 'branding'.

Harry and Meghan have spent tens of thousands of pounds on a new Sussex Royal website to complement their hugely popular Instagram feed.

They have also sought to register Sussex Royal as a global trademark for a range of items and activities, including clothing, stationery, books and teaching materials.

In addition, they have taken steps to set up a new charitable organisation: Sussex Royal, The Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. It has now been made clear that they will need to 're-brand'.

However, it is understood the couple have accepted that, as part of their new working arrangements, they will not be able to use the Sussex Royal name as they had hoped.

The development is thought to represent a major blow to the Sussexes, who now face starting again and re-registering everything from their website to their charity under a new label.

Harry and Meghan first began using the Sussex Royal branding this time last year, after they split their household from that of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge – known as Kensington Royal.

The Sussexes' Instagram page, @sussexroyal, has amassed 11.2million followers – the same number of fans as William and Kate's account.

It was a natural progression, therefore, for Harry and Meghan to use the moniker for their new charitable foundation, due to be launched this year with the support of Buckingham Palace.

And as they secretly prepared for a new life in Canada, it was clear that Sussex Royal was at the forefront of Harry and Meghan's plans.

Dozens of trademark applications were made for everything from bandanas to notebooks – although sources have always stressed that these were preventative measures to protect the trademark from others, and never intended for commercial use.

The couple also privately commissioned a new website. It went live last month to coincide with their bombshell announcement, with the introduction: 'Welcome to the Sussex Royal community, your source for information on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.'

436,Where can savers find the best rates after NS&I slashes its accounts?,"['Ben Wilkinson', 'Sylvia Morris For The Daily Mail', 'Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links. If You Click On Them We May Earn A Small Commission. That Helps Us Fund This Is Money', 'Keep It Free To Use. We Do Not Write Articles To Promote Products. We Do Not Allow Any Commercial Relationship To Affect Our Editorial Independence.']","Millions of savers are in dire straits after National Savings and Investments (NS&I) announced sweeping rate cuts.

The Treasury-backed savings giant is to slash rates on more than a dozen products - including Britain's most popular savings product Premium Bonds.

Experts say the Government needs to act urgently to reignite the nation's savings habit, as many will be wondering where to shelter their nest eggs.

Rates cuts: Treasury-backed savings giant National Savings and Investments is to cut rates on more than a dozen products including Britain's most popular savings product Premium Bonds

Money Mail has been calling for better rates to be paid to savers with our 'Stop Short-Changing Savers' campaign.

Former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith also writes in Money Mail today and calls for the Government to do more to bring relief to starved savers.

NS&I's latest round of cuts, which start in May, will deprive savers of rewards worth a total of at least £234 million.

The changes will hit nearly all of NS&I's 25 million customers — including 21 million Premium Bond holders.

It comes as interest rates offered by High Street banks and building societies have been in freefall for months.

NS&I says it has been forced to slash rates on savings accounts and bonds by as much as 0.45 percentage points in response to paltry rewards offered on the High Street, and the poor performance of Government bonds.

NS&I is also restricted as to how much money it can raise for Government, and it cannot offer rates that would undermine the commercial market. But the latest round of rates cuts are indicative of just how bad it has got for savers.

Experts fear banks and building societies will follow suit and cut their rates even further. Already, hot on the heels of NS&I cuts, Marcus by Goldman Sachs and Saga have announced rate drops.

The Marcus account goes down from 1.35 per cent to 1.30 per cent from today for new savers, and on March 10 for existing ones.

The Saga Easy Access account, where the deposit taker is Goldman Sachs, also falls today to 1.3 per cent, including a 0.2 percentage point bonus.

So is there anywhere savers can safely put their money and still enjoy a decent return?

WHAT'S UP FOR THE CHOP?

NS&I will pull 173,718 tax-free prizes out of its monthly Premium Bonds prize draw. This includes one of the six £100,000 prizes and more than 145,000 of the £25 prizes.

Income bond-holders have been particularly badly hit. Some 180,000 savers will see their rate tumble by 39 per cent to 0.7 per cent from the current 1.15 per cent.

These bonds offer easy access to your money and are popular with pensioners because they pay interest monthly.

The 0.7 per cent rate is at its lowest level since March 2009 when the general level of interest rates stood at 0.5 per cent, against 0.75 per cent today. Since then savers have earned as much as 2 per cent.

Anna Bowes, director at Savings Champion, says: 'Pensioners will find this the cut particularly difficult. It will have a damaging effect on the money in their pocket.'

NS&I is also cutting the rate on its Direct Saver account from 1 per cent to 0.7 per cent; the Investment Account from 0.8 per cent to 0.6 per cent; Guaranteed Growth Bonds from 1.25 per cent to 1.1 per cent on a one-year fix when it matures; Guaranteed Income Bonds from 1.2 per cent to 1.05 per cent on a one-year fix; and a five-year Fixed Interest Savings Certificate from 1.9 per cent to 1.6 per cent.

WILL PREMIUM BONDS STILL PAY?

Around 21 million of us have money invested in Premium Bonds, and receive entry into a prize draw every month instead of guaranteed interest rate rewards.

NS&I is cutting the reward rate from an interest rate equivalent of 1.4 per cent to 1.3 per cent — the lowest it has been for more than two years.

As a result, the chances of receiving any rewards on your savings is dropping from one in 24,500 to one in 26,000.

There will still be two top prizes of £1 million, but the number of other prizes is being scaled back.

The number of £100 and £50 prizes on offer has halved — from 27,221 to just 13,448 of each.

For a saver with £50,000 invested, the chances of winning at least £25 a year are still 100 per cent. But for a saver with £1,000 invested, the odds will fall 4.4 per cent to 37 per cent.

Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, says: 'Even before the cuts, the most likely outcome for most Premium Bond savers was that they'd win nothing in a typical month.

'Savers know they won't get reliable returns, but they still love Premium Bonds because they offer the outside chance of a major tax-free prize. That's not going to change: they'll still be making two millionaires a month.'

But she adds: 'The price you pay for opting for Premium Bonds is that you don't earn any interest, so the chances are you'll lose value after inflation.

'They are unlikely to be the right place for all your savings and you should be sure you're getting a competitive rate of return on the rest of your money.'

'We will ditch our bonds if we stop winning' Lizzy Dring was recommended Premium Bonds as a way of saving by her uncle a year ago, and has since bought thousands for herself and her young niece and nephew. She has won four £25 cash prizes, but fears her lucky streak will slow after NS&I's rate cuts. Lizzy, who runs a team-building events firm, says: 'NS&I should carefully look at how often they are reducing the chances of winning. I'd be happier to win smaller amounts but more often. Disenchanted: NS &I investor Lizzy Dring, pictured with young niece Bella, was drawn to the bonds as a safe place to keep her cash which was not immediately accessible 'If they keep cutting the number of prizes, it will feel like the actual lottery, which most people have no chance of winning.' As a self-employed worker, Lizzy, who lives in Norwich, was drawn to the bonds as a safe place to keep her cash which was not immediately accessible. You can cash in the bonds whenever you like, but it takes a few days for the money to reach your account. The odds were also attractive. She says: 'I have only between £2,000 and £4,000 invested at any one time, and no other savings account could beat the bonds.' However, Lizzy, 26, says her last win was in September, and the planned rate cuts will reduce her chances of winning. She plans to give it another year, and if she wins only one cash prize — or, worse, none — she may move her money. Rae Radford, 57, already plans to cash hers in. Only last month she invested £30,000 in Premium Bonds, but since hearing about the proposed cuts would rather put it towards property. The retired social media expert, from Kent, chose bonds because they offered better odds compared with interest rates elsewhere. Nikki Thomas has been a NS&I customer since 2014 She says: 'What NS&I is planning to do is shocking. I will be looking to invest my cash somewhere else, that's for sure.' Meanwhile, career coach Nikki Thomas, from London, began taking her money out of NS&I in September, when it announced the last wave of cuts. She has split her cash between investments, high-interest savings accounts and Isas. She says: 'Premium Bonds are definitely not as good as they used to be, and I have noticed I do not win nearly as much. When I was winning prizes I used to recommend the bonds — but I wouldn't any more.' Nikki, 34, has been a NS&I customer since 2014. With interest rates generally so low, she and her friends chose the bonds because they seemed to be a better alternative. Mother-of-one Claire Foster is also disappointed about NS&I's rate cuts, but says she will stick with her Premium Bonds, still hoping to win the jackpot. Her first bonds were bought for her as a baby by her grandparents, and she initially had a few thousand pounds worth. But after the sale of a flat six years ago Claire, who lives in Dulwich, South London, had the maximum holding of £50,000. The wins earned more than her cash Isa. She chose NS&I Premium Bonds because she says they were 'safe and easily accessible'. Claire, 38, has also bought Premium Bonds for her one-year-old son, Arthur, and encourages family to do the same for his birthday and Christmas gifts. He has about £2,000 invested but has yet to win. A combination of NS&I rate cuts and cashing in some bonds to fund her maternity leave has led to a drop in wins for Claire. She says: 'I'm disappointed the prizes will reduce again but remain hopeful for a big win. I check my number every month. ' Patricia Timpson, from Buckinghamshire, has had Premium Bonds for more than 30 years, and when her daughters married she bought them some, too. But last night the 74-year-old said the cuts were 'outrageous'. She says: 'I remember when my bank was offering 12 per cent interest. But now you no sooner put your money somewhere than the rate is cut. I thought low interest rates would be temporary, but they are just getting worse.'

IS PROTECTION WORTH PRICE?

Millions of savers choose to keep their money with NS&I because their cash is 100 per cent protected by the Government, whereas ordinary banks can only guarantee £85,000.

This total protection has seen savers flock to NS&I in the wake of the financial crisis and the collapse of Northern Rock.

But experts say savers may now be considering whether the low rates are a price worth paying.

Justin Modray, of Candid Financial Advice, says: 'As it continues to slash rates, NS&I is rapidly shifting from hero to zero.'

James Blower, founder of advice site Savings Guru, says: 'NS&I is in a difficult position as the Government can raise money more cheaply through gilts.

'But current rates are nowhere near the best buys. Cutting rates by up to 40 per cent feels savage in these circumstances.

'With the exception of Premium Bonds, which are still competitive compared with easy-access savings accounts, I would suggest that NS&I savers look elsewhere.'

However, Patrick Connolly, from independent financial adviser Chase de Vere, believes NS&I is still an attractive prospect.

He says: 'This is awful news for savers, but rates are terrible everywhere and are very unlikely to improve any time soon.'

WHERE SHOULD MY SAVINGS GO?

Savers have to work hard for a decent return.

The UK's biggest bank, Lloyds, has this month launched a one-year fixed-rate bond paying 1 per cent — but only to those who can afford the minimum deposit of £100,000.

The top-paying easy-access account on the market is currently Virgin Money's Double Take E-Saver Issue 14, which pays interest at 1.31 per cent yearly.

The Virgin Money Double Take E-Saver 14 can also pay interest at 1.3 per cent monthly.

Those happy to lock their savings up in fixed- rate bonds for a year can get 1.65 per cent annual interest with Atom bank. Meanwhile, Atom also pays monthly interest at 1.64 per cent for a one-year fixed deal.

Your money is covered by the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) in all the banks and building societies in Money Mail's best buy tables.

This gives you £85,000 of cover — £170,000 on joint accounts in the event of the provider running into trouble. The FSCS aims to pay out within seven days of any failure.

SO NOW IT'S OVER TO YOU, CHANCELLOR...

Pressure is mounting on the newly appointed Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who is due to deliver the Conservative-majority Government's first Budget next month.

Consumer experts are hoping something will be done to encourage the nation to save more.

Former pensions minister Steve Webb called on the Government to 'think about how repeated interest-rate cuts undermine its wider message about the importance of saving'.

He says: 'This latest announcement is another blow to those who are prudent and set something aside for a rainy day.'

Meanwhile, James Daley, of consumer campaign group Fairer Finance, says: 'It's been a rough decade for savers and the 2020s don't look like they're going to be much better.

'With Rishi Sunak's first Budget coming up, I'm sure savers will be keeping their fingers crossed that he'll be doing something to support them.'

NS&I chief executive Ian Ackerley says: 'Reducing interest rates is always a difficult decision. We need to ensure our interest rates are set at an appropriate position against those of our competitors.

'We believe our new rates offer our customers a fair return and the assurance of the 100 per cent HM Treasury guarantee on all their holdings with NS&I.'

Nationwide's Start to Save account offers quarterly prize draws with payouts of £100 to lucky savers as well as 1 per cent interest.

The aim is to encourage people to build a rainy-day fund.

Nationwide's Start to Save account offers quarterly prize draws with payouts of £100 to lucky savers as well as 1 per cent interest

The new account supports the Government-sponsored Money and Pensions Service target to persuade millions more who struggle to save regularly. More than 11 million people in the UK have less than £100 in savings.

Nationwide will have four prize draws. The first will be in July, with the others following at three- monthly intervals.

To be eligible for the draws you must increase your balance by £50 a month prior to the draw.

Nationwide says the odds of winning are, at worst, one in 67 — far better then Premium Bonds, where the odds will drop to one in 26,000 in May.

The more people save, the more prizes there will be, which means the odds could drop.

The total prize fund for each draw will be 1 per cent of the total balance increases on qualifying Start to Save accounts in the three months leading up to the draw.

438,Britain's first acid attack killer 'launches jihadi attack on three prison guards',"['Terri-Ann Williams', 'Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline']","Britain's first acid attacker killer launched a copycat jihadist attack on prison staff threatening officers with a sharpened instrument in his cell as officials fear an upsurge in 'jail extremism'.

Xeneral Imiuru was locked up in 2018 after being convicted for an acid attack that killed nurse Joanne Rand at a Vue cinema in west London.

Downing Street has already been urged to confront the threat of extremism in jails up and down the country.

He had previously assaulted officers at another jail and it has now been revealed that he attempted a jihadist attack at Winchester jail.

The 20-year-old is believed to have faked a suicide attempt in order to lure officers into his cell.

Xeneral Imiuru (pictured above) was jailed in 2018 for the first ever acid attack killing.

Once they were inside the cell they found Imiruru on the floor. Three officers entered and the inmate lunged at them with a weapon that had been strapped to his arm, before being restrained.

The Times reported that he told officers that he was attempting a jihadist attack, despite the fact he was not in prison for terrorist offences.

The Prison Service confirmed to The Times that the attack had taken place and that it was being investigated.

The incident last Thursday comes after the inmate had been segregated from other inmates because he was assessed as a threat.

Prisoners posing as jail ‘emirs’ in jails across the UK have been forcing some to convert to their Islamic ideology.

The incident happened at Winchester prison (pictured above) where officers had to restrain Imiuru

Since terrorist Sudesh Amman was released early from his sentence last month, going on to stab two people in Streatham, London, Downing Street has been urged to confront the threat of extremism in jails.

It is believed that Imiuru’s attempt to copy jihadist methods will be a concern to those in the prison service.

Speaking to the Times, former prison governor Ian Acheson said the attack was ‘disturbing’.

Mr Acheson had conducted an official review of prison extremism in 2016 and said the attack suggested ‘careful pre-meditation at the least’.

‘The attack could well have been inspired by recent violent extremism inside and outside the prison walls.

‘It’s extremely important that the police investigation is speedy and transparent and that a terrorist motive is thoroughly investigated’.

London Bridge attacker Usman Khan used the method of strapping weapons to his arm, it was also used in the 2017 attack.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8018303/Britains-acid-attack-killer-launches-jihadi-attack-three-prison-guards.html
439,Prison teacher wrote to inmate in her children's names saying 'thank you for making mummy happy',"['Joe Middleton', 'Joe Middleton For Mailonline']","The husband of a prison teacher exposed her affair with an inmate after finding 107 messages between the pair on a secret mobile phone SIM card, a court heard today.

Melissa Frost, 36, exchanged letters, phone calls and text messages with the prisoner while having a relationship with him at Wayland Prison near Thetford, Norfolk.

Her husband became suspicious that she was having an affair, possibly with a prison officer, and using a second mobile phone to contact her lover.

Norwich Crown Court heard how he searched their home and discovered the SIM card which he put into his own mobile phone, so he could read the messages sent and received by his wife.

Prison teacher Melissa Frost (left) pictured walking with another woman (right) to Norwich Crown Court today. She was jailed for four months after she admitted having a relationship with a prisoner at Wayland Prison, Norfolk

The messages sent over two months in 2017 included expressions of 'loving and longing' between his wife and the inmate, saying how they were missing each other and hoping to be together soon, said prosecutor Martin Ivory.

The convict's named was not identified during court proceedings.

Frost's husband immediately reported what he found to the prison's deputy governor who began an investigation in December 2017.

The mother-of-two made a 'full and frank confession' that she had been in a relationship with the inmate who was serving a five year and four month sentence for arson at the Category C jail.

Frost insisted that the pair had only indulged in kisses and cuddles, rather than full sexual activity.

Frost of North Walsham, Norfolk, (pictured on social media) admitted misconduct in a public office and wept in the dock as she was jailed for four months

Letters between them were recovered, along with evidence that he had called her from an official prison phone using his allocation of minutes for private calls, said Mr Ivory.

One of the letters was written in the names of Frost's two children, now aged five and seven, in which they thanked the inmate 'for making Mummy happy.'

The letters made clear that they were talking about having more sexual activity on the inmate's release from prison.

Mr Ivory said that Frost worked as a supply teacher at the prison on a zero hours contract, and had become friendly with the prisoner in July 2017, and they later began 'conversing.'

He added: 'Just to make things crystal clear, it is not the case that the prisoner was using an illicit phone. The contact was over the prison phone.

He added: 'She felt she was in love with him at that time, but she was not quite sure of her feelings for him at the time of the interview.

Frost's husband immediately reported what he found to the prison's deputy governor who began an investigation in December 2017.

'She denied any sexual conduct, but was aware of her responsibilities for security being as she was a prison key holder. She had not discussed what was going on with any other prisoner or prison staff.

'At the time this was going on, there were difficulties in her private life.'

Frost of North Walsham, Norfolk, admitted misconduct in a public office and wept in the dock as she was jailed for four months.

Judge Stephen Holt told her: 'This sort of offending goes to the heart of the prison system. It opens up a prison to the danger of blackmail and contraband entering the prison system, which causes so much damage.

'I and most people have considerable sympathy for you, but this court has to give a clear message that anyone working in the prison system must expect an immediate custodial sentence for this type of offence.'

Judge Holt said he considered the letter from Frost's children to the prisoner was an aggravating factor in the case.

The court heard that Frost had now lost her career as a teacher, but had got a new job and was in a new relationship.

David Stewart, defending, said she had made full admissions and suffered stress, worry and sleepless nights while waiting for the case to come to court.

He added: 'There is no suggestion of illicit substances or items being brought into the prison which would compromise security. She was going through a rough patch at home with her former husband.

'But bearing in mind the animosity when they separated, he clearly thinks a lot of her, and speaks of her affectionately, and praises her mothering skills.

'You have to ask what the defendant has done. She had a relationship, but it was not of a sexual nature.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8017319/Prison-teacher-wrote-inmate-childrens-names-saying-thank-making-mummy-happy.html
440,Seven men abused schoolgirls aged between 12 and 15 in 'truly appalling ways',"['Terri-Ann Williams', 'Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline']","Seven men have been convicted of raping two vulnerable schoolgirls who were groomed by being 'made to feel special' by predators who 'abused them in truly appalling ways'.

The abuse happened between 1995 and 2007 in Huddersfield and the girls were groomed between the ages of 12 and 15.

Usman Ali, Banaras Hussain, Abdul Majid, Gul Riaz and three other defendants were found guilty today after a four-week trial at Leeds Crown Court.

A jury took 12 hours and 49 minutes to convict the men of 12 offences, including rape and indecent assault.

Three of the rapists cannot be named for legal reasons and are set to be sentenced tomorrow morning.

Usman Ali (pictured above), also known as Johnny, 34, from Huddersfield, was unanimously convicted of two counts of rape

The court heard from prosecutor Kate Batty who stated that the victims were deliberately targeted by older men and had been made to feel special when they gave them alcohol, drugs and cigarettes.

It was said that the abuse often took place in cars, hotels and flats, including in a flat belonging to a man who was 'involved with drugs and had a gun'.

Mrs Batty said the girls would 'regularly be out of it' with drink and drugs and added that the first victim had been introduced to older men by a school friend.

'She didn't know their names half of the time or she would know only their nickname. She was threatened, she was spoken down to, she was intimidated and she was assaulted.

Gul Riaz (above), also known as Saj, 43, from Crosland Moor, was unanimously convicted of two counts of rape and two counts of indecent assault

'She was frightened and she saw absolutely no way out of this life.'

She added that the youngster had been 'utterly corrupted' and that she had been 'made to believe she had no choice' but to continue with the lifestyle she had found herself in.

The victim's family had tried hard to keep her safe and had sought help from both police and social services on multiple occasions.

Mrs Batty added: Back then, perhaps the authorities didn't have the understanding that they now have about grooming and child sexual exploitation.

'Social services eventually told [the girl's] family that [she] must love it if she keeps going back.'

The second victim was subjected to the abuse when she was just 15-years-old.

'The final straw for her was when she was thrown out of a car with her trousers round her ankles, having had sex with two or three of the men in the car - she can't remember[how many].

'She was drunk and drugged. She was 15 years old', Mrs Batty said.

Ali, also known as Johnny, 34, from Huddersfield, was unanimously convicted of two counts of rape.

Hussain, 39, from Shipley, was unanimously convicted of one count of rape.

Majid, also known as Smokey, 35, from Crosland Moor, was unanimously convicted of two counts of rape.

Riaz, also known as Saj, 43, also from Crosland Moor, was unanimously convicted of two counts of rape and two counts of indecent assault.

A 37-year-old man was unanimously convicted of one count of rape.

A 36-year-old man was unanimously convicted of one count of rape.

A 30-year-old man was convicted of rape by a majority.

The Crown Prosecution Service and the local police commented on the case after the verdicts were delivered.

Michael Quinn, from the CPS, said: 'At the heart of this case are the two victims. They have suffered immensely as a result of their childhood abuse.

We would like to acknowledge their great courage in coming forward to assist the investigation and then to support the prosecution.

'I sincerely hope the convictions of their abusers will go some way to helping these young women to rebuild their lives. Our thoughts remain with them.'

DCI Richard McNamara, of Kirklees District Police, said: 'The men involved in these vile offences have robbed their victims of their childhood and abused them in truly appalling ways.

'It is difficult to imagine the impact on the victims of the abuse they suffered but it is clear their courage in reporting what was done to them and in supporting the prosecution has helped take some dangerous men off our streets.

'The guilty verdicts today will hopefully be a milestone for them in seeing those responsible begin to pay for what they have done as will the forthcoming sentences of these individuals.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8017733/Seven-men-abused-schoolgirls-aged-12-15-truly-appalling-ways.html
441,Liberal Democrats 'to expel ex-leader David Steel',"['Daniel Martin Policy', 'Daniel Martin Policy Editor For The Daily Mail']","Former Liberal leader Lord Steel faces expulsion from his party over his failure to pass on his suspicions about paedophile MP Cyril Smith.

He is set to be the first politician singled out for censure by the national child sex abuse inquiry, it was reported last night.

The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) is set to publish its conclusions next week.

Friends of the peer fear he will be made a 'scapegoat' over his admission that he failed to pass on information about former Rochdale MP Smith's abuse of boys.

Last night the Liberal Democrats declined to comment – but it is understood a committee of senior MPs and peers is being convened to discuss Lord Steel's future.

Former Liberal leader Lord Steel (pictured) faces expulsion from his party over his failure to pass on his suspicions about paedophile MP Cyril Smith

Friends of Lord Steel, who led the Liberal Party between 1976 and 1988 and is now 81, accused the inquiry of 'scraping the barrel' in order to justify the huge cost of the investigation.

They also described Lib Dem moves to expel the peer as 'double jeopardy' because he has already been suspended, cleared and readmitted to the party over the same issue.

The Westminster strand of the inquiry has failed to find any evidence of a widespread paedophile ring operating among MPs.

It was set up by Theresa May on the back of a series of such allegations, many of which have since proved to be without foundation.

David Steel pictured with Cyril Smith pictured at the Midway Hotel in Rochester in 1977

Smith, who died in 2010, is accused of sexually abusing scores of boys. He was never charged in his lifetime

Close colleagues, including former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Campbell, are considering quitting if Lord Steel is expelled.

A friend of the peer, who is abroad, told The Daily Telegraph: 'This is really low-hanging fruit for IICSA. There is no allegation about Lord Steel's personal behaviour, but the way in which he dealt with some publicity about Smith which he raised with him 40 years ago.

'There is a real fear IICSA will use this as a small trophy and the Liberal Democrats will seize upon any criticism to expel him. We think IICSA will scapegoat him on the basis he is the only name they have got.'

The inquiry, which has already cost the taxpayer £150million, will also criticise Lord Steel for his decision to recommend Smith for a knighthood.

Smith, who died in 2010, is accused of sexually abusing scores of boys. He was never charged in his lifetime.

The report is understood, according to sources close to the inquiry, to be highly critical of his failure to notify authorities after an admission by Smith that claims about him in Private Eye magazine were true.

The Private Eye article accused Smith of spanking boys and conducting intimate 'medical examinations' at a Rochdale hostel, but Smith had insisted police took no further action

Under questioning, Lord Steel told IICSA of a conversation he had with Smith in 1979, in which the then MP admitted his behaviour was investigated a decade earlier.

The Private Eye article accused Smith of spanking boys and conducting intimate 'medical examinations' at a Rochdale hostel, but Smith had insisted police took no further action.

Lord Steel told IICSA last March that he 'assumed' Smith had actually committed the offences.

The peer's supporters point out that, at the time of the abuse in the 1960s, Smith had already been investigated with no action taken.

They add that the conversation with Smith took place at an informal dinner in the Commons at which Lord Steel raised the Private Eye articles. But they insist he did not discuss their content in any detail.

Friends of Lord Steel also say it is unfair to criticise him for recommending Smith for a knighthood in 1988, when the honours committee had the power to investigate him.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8018573/Liberal-Democrats-expel-ex-leader-David-Steel.html
442,Rapper Dave slams Boris Johnson as 'a real racist' and hits out at Grenfell Tower response,"['Terri-Ann Williams', 'Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline']","Rapper Dave slammed Prime Minister Boris Johnson at last night's Brit awards, accusing the Conservative leader of being racist.

The 21-year-old scooped the Brit Award for Album of the Year and performed his hit 'Black', a track which charts the difficulties of Black Brits.

In a surprise moment for viewers and those in attendance at the O2 in London he debuted a brand new verse criticising Mr Johnson.

'It is racist, whether or not it feels racist, the truth is our prime minister's a real racist. They say – 'you should be grateful, we're the least racist', I say the least racist is still racist.'

Prime Minister Boris Johnson (pictured above last week) was criticised at the awards last night

Dave performed at the awards where he highlighted a host of topics including the tragedy at Grenfell tower

Just last month Mr Johnson was criticised by Grenfell survivors who said the Prime Minister had downgraded the government's interest in the disaster, with many claiming he was 'out of touch' with what they were going through.

Mr Johnson wasn't the only Prime Minister to get a mention at the awards last night as US rapper Tyler, The Creator, also referenced former leader Theresa May.

Mrs May had banned Tyler in 2015 from entering the UK after she claimed his music 'fostered hatred'.

Accepting the award for the best international solo male he dedicated it to 'someone who I hold dear to my heart, who made it so I couldn't come to this country five years ago, and I hope she's at home p***** off: thank you, Theresa May'.

Aside from talk of politicians, Dave also used his performance to pay tribute to prison rehabilitation worker Jack Merritt who was killed in November 2019 in a terror attack.

Tyler the creator (pictured above last night) dedicated his award 'someone who I hold dear to my heart'

Theresa May (pictured above) previously said that Tyler, The Creator could not enter the UK

He rapped that he was his 'brother in arms' and said there were 'tears in our eyes and love in our hearts'.

'We never had the same background, culture, colour or past but you devoted your life to give others a chance. And for that, I'm so taken aback because he gave us all a voice.'

As well as the touching tribute he rapped about tougher sentenced and claimed all Jack would have wanted was 'unity and equal opportunity'.

Like others before him, he used his platform to highlight that the survivors of the Grenfell tower tragedy still needed accommodation and that support was also needed for the Windrush generation.

In 2018 Stormzy, who also performed at last night's ceremony, slammed Mrs May for not doing enough for Grenfell victims and said 'where's the money for Grenfell'.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8018621/Rapper-Dave-slams-Boris-Johnson-real-racist-hits-Grenfell-Tower-response.html

Ahead of her BRITs performance, the Grammy-Award winning singer/songwriter revealed all about the creative process behind the track.

Billie sat down with her producer and co-writer brother Finneas O'Connell, telling BBC presenter Louise Minchin that Bond himself had to approve their track No Time To Die.

Finneas explained that Bond star Daniel Craig is involved in every aspect of their movie franchise, including the theme song.

The duo wrote the song for the 25th Bond movie on a tour bus in Texas over just three days, after failing to get the creative juices flowing in the studio.

'We've been wanting to make a Bond song for years. I remember at the beginning of last year we told our whole team that if any Bond things come up we want to be involved if we can possibly be,' Billie revealed of her long-held ambition.

Finneas agreed, explaining: 'There are few things as desirable as doing a Bond song and we didn't take the opportunity lightly. We really just tried to work as hard as we could to prove ourselves worthy of that.'

Billie will perform the track live at Tuesday night's star-studded BRIT Awards at London's O2, and the seasoned performer admitted: 'I'm so scared. We've never performed it ever, so it feels so weird that it's in the public, especially now that I'm performing it and I'm hitting a note I've never hit before. I'm scared.'

He said: 'My name is Lewis. Thanks very f***ing much. Contrary to many people thinking it's about my ex-girlfriend who you can now see every night on 'Love island', it's actually about my grandmother who sadly passed away a few years ago.'

The singer - who had clearly hit the booze hard - then thanked his grandmother for 'dying', before apologising.

He said: 'I hope to God ITV don't contact her to be on a dating show.

Well done: English singer Mabel, 23, was nominated for three awards and ultimately claimed one of the biggest of the night - Best British Female Artist

'It's the best year of my life. Thanks to my mum and dad for making love and thanks to my grandmother for dying. Sorry. See you later.'

Caroline had been a regular staple at the BRIT awards, attending the red carpet and event consecutively for the last nine years since 2011.

The ITV star took her own life after a worried friend who was staying with her went to the shops, leaving the ex-Love Island presenter alone at her London flat.

It came just hours after she was told she would face trial for allegedly assaulting her boyfriend Lewis Burton, something she denied.

An inquest into Caroline's death is due to open on Wednesday morning, just four days after the former Love Island host was found dead.

Upsetting: Caroline took her own life aged 40 after a worried friend who was staying with her went to the shops, leaving the ex- Love Island presenter alone at her London flat

It will open and adjourn at 10am at Poplar Coroner's Court in London, a representative of the court has confirmed.

Her management have slammed the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for pursuing the 'show trial' after Lewis said he did not want to press charges.

Caroline had been described by friends as feeling 'she was on her own' and 'couldn't see a way out,' according to The Mirror.

Legend: Caroline had been a regular staple at the BRIT awards, attending the red carpet and event consecutively for the last nine years since 2011 (pictured L-R at the BRITs in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014)

It was also understood she had been struggling with her mental health and using anti-depressants before her death.

The TV presenter's death was confirmed by a lawyer for the family. The Flack family said in a statement: 'We can confirm that our Caroline passed away today on the 15th February. We would ask that the press respect the privacy of the family at this difficult time.'

A worried producer friend had been staying with the star but found she couldn't get back into her flat after returning from the shops, a source said. She called Caroline's father Ian who gained entry to the flat where he found the star's body.

Over the years: The late presenter pictured at the annual event in 2015, 2016 and 2017 (L-R)

More recently: Caroline pictured posing with a rose at the 2018 BRITs, left, and at the last February at the 2019 show, right

Love Island also released a statement, they said: 'Everybody at Love Island and ITV is shocked and saddened by this desperately sad news.

'Caroline was a much loved member of the Love Island team and our sincere thoughts and condolences are with her family and friends.'

Following Caroline's death, many fans have taken to social media to demand that Love Island be axed, after she became the third person associated with the show to take their own life.

Former contestants Mike Thalassitis and Sophie Gradon, took their own lives in March 2019 and June 2018.

Among fans calling the show out was This Morning presenter Eamonn Holmes who paid tribute to Caroline while insisting there needs to be 'repercussions.'

Heartbreaking: Caroline took her own life after a worried friend who was staying with her went to the shops, leaving the ex-Love Island presenter alone at her London flat (pictured in 2018)

He wrote on Twitter: 'Caroline Flack .... Dear God. Shocked beyond belief. May she have found peace. #Rip Has to be repercussions for Love Island now surely?' which garnered more than 27K likes.

Eamonn later added: 'Meaning out of respect, can the series continue?' (sic)

A CPS spokesperson issued a statement, they said: 'Our deepest sympathies go to the family and friends of Caroline Flack.

'Given the tragic circumstances, we will not comment on the specifics of this case at this stage.'

Tragic: It came just hours after she was told she would face trial for allegedly assaulting her boyfriend Lewis Burton, something she denied (pictured together in October)

Lewis Capaldi, Stormzy and Billie Eilish led the winners on Tuesday evening in a largely male dominated BRIT Awards shortlist.

Lewis, 23, claimed two awards from four nominations, triumphing in the categories for New Artist and Song of the Year.

The latter nomination was awarded for hit single Someone You Loved, a track Capaldi insisted was written for his late grandmother - not former girlfriend and current Love Island star Paige Turley.

Meanwhile Stormzy, 26, picked up the award for Best Male Solo Artist in front of a star-studded audience that included ex-girlfriend Maya Jama.

Accepting his award, the grime star was quick to reference the gender disparity at this year's ceremony by thanking the team of 'brilliant women' who form his management team.

Nominations: Lewis Capaldi (pictured), former One Direction heartthrob Harry Styles and grime star Stormzy are among the artists nominated in a male-dominated BRIT Awards shortlist

Rising superstar Billie Eilish, 18, received a nod in the International Female Solo Artist category alongside the likes of Lizzo and Ariana Grande.

And after performing new James Bond soundtrack No Time To Die live for the first time, she claimed her first BRIT Award from former Spice Girl Mel C.

Despite Billie's success, only four nominations out of a possible 25 in the categories which are not gender-specific featured women.

There were no female performers included in the shortlists for best group or album awards, although English singer Mabel, 23, was nominated for three awards and ultimately claimed one of the biggest of the night - Best British Female Artist.

Elsewhere Dave's excellent Psychodrama beat stiff competition to win Best Album ahead of Stormzy's new release Heavy Is The Head, Michael Kiwanuka's self-titled LP Harry Styles' Fine Line and Lewis Capaldi's Divinely Uninspired To A Hellish Extent.

Oxford based band Foals won Best Group after a return to the spotlight with their conceptual, two-part Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost.

The group beat Bastille, Bring Me The Horizon, Coldplay and D-Block Europe to the honour on Tuesday night.

Taking it global, innovative rapper Tyler, The Creator beat Bruce Springsteen, Burna Boy, Dermot Kennedy and Post Malone in the category for International Male Solo Artist.

The lack of nominations in for female artists comes despite a major overhaul of the Brits' voting academy in 2017 to make it more gender balanced and diverse, with hundreds of new members invited to join the pool.

The awards are voted for by around 1,500 people from across the UK music industry including journalists, record label employees and musicians.

The rising star winner was announced as Celeste late last year, while the producer of the year will be announced at a later date.

The international group and video categories were axed by organisers this year.

Stars brought the glamour as they arrived on the red carpet for the Brit Awards 2020 at London's The O2 on Tuesday.

Harry Styles, Laura Whitmore, Abbey Clancy and Ellie Goulding led the arrivals on the red carpet in the build up to the biggest music night in the UK.

Watermelon Sugar singer Harry, 26, paid tribute to his late ex Caroline Flack, who died on Saturday, as he wore a black ribbon on his lapel as he arrived.

Brit Awards 2020: Harry Styles, Laura Whitmore, Abbey Clancy and Ellie Goulding led the arrivals on the red carpet in the build up to the biggest music night in the UK

Harry, who is nominated in the British Male Solo Artist and British Album categories, looked sombre as he posed in a 70s inspired suit, purple jumper and a pearl necklace.

The star dated Caroline for three months back in 2011 when he was 17 and and she was 31, in a highly publicised romance.

The outing comes after Harry was mugged at knife-point close to his London home. The singer was out in affluent suburb Hampstead on Valentine's Day when he was confronted and threatened by a man who pulled a knife on him.

The thug demanded cash from the singer and Styles quickly complied, managing to get away unharmed.

Tribute: Harry, who dated Caroline in 2011 when he was 17 and she was 32, wore a ribbon in respect of the late Love Island host

A source said the singer 'played it cool' and kept calm despite his attacker's blade.

But they added he was 'shaken up' by the robbery, which came just hours before his ex-girlfriend Caroline Flack was found dead at her London home.

The shocking mugging has emerged ahead of Styles' performance at the BRIT awards tonight.

The source told the Mirror: 'He actually played it pretty cool, quickly giving the assailant cash, keeping himself and the guy calm and getting the situation over with.

'Understandably though it left him very shaken up afterwards.

'Given how Caroline took her own life the next day, the pressures of a new album and a performance at the Brit Awards this evening, it's fair to say this is the last thing poor old Harry needed.'

Former Love Island presenter Caroline died on Saturday aged 40 at her new flat in Stoke Newington, London, hours after she was told she would face trial over the alleged assault of boyfriend Lewis Burton last year.

Love Island host Laura Whitmore, 34, donned a newspaper-print gown in her first red carpet appearance since the death of Caroline,

449,Caroline Flack's family release an unpublished Instagram post,"['Alexander Robertson', 'Alexander Robertson For Mailonline']","Caroline Flack's family have released an unpublished Instagram post the star wrote in the days before her death in which she said her arrest for assault had meant her whole world had 'collapsed'.

The presenter insisted in the heart-rending message that she was not a domestic abuser and that her alleged assault on boyfriend Lewis Burton was an accident.

In the message, shared by her mother Chris through the family's local paper in Norwich today, the former Love Island host explained how her 'whole world and future was swept from under my feet' in the 24 hours following her arrest.

An inquest this morning heard how Flack had hanged herself inside her Stoke Newington flat and despite resuscitation attempts, she was pronounced dead.

Coroner's officer Sandra Polson gave the provisional cause of death as suspension by ligature, with a full inquest scheduled for August 5.

In her message, Flack revealed that she had been having 'some sort of emotional breakdown for a very long time' as that she and her family 'could not take it anymore'.

The 40-year-old had planned to post the message on social media and had shown it to her mother at the end of January, but advisers warned her not to share it with her millions of followers.

Caroline Flack leaves Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court in North London in December 2019

A court heard Caroline Flack had hit her boyfriend Lewis Burton (above, together) with a lamp

Miss Flack killed herself at home in this building in Stoke Newington, East London, on Saturday

Flack said she 'took responsibility for what happened that night' but said it had been an accident and she 'was NOT a domestic abuser'.

She added: 'We had an argument and an accident happened. An accident. The blood that someone SOLD to a newspaper was MY blood and that was something very sad and very personal.

'The reason I am talking today is because my family can't take anymore. I've lost my job. My home. My ability to speak. And the truth has been taken out of my hands and used as entertainment.

'I can't spend every day hidden away being told not to say or speak to anyone.

'I'm so sorry to my family for what I have brought upon them and for what my friends have had to go through.

'I'm not thinking about ""how I'm going to get my career back"". I'm thinking about how I'm going to get mine and my family's life back.'

Why did the CPS pursue the assault charges when the alleged victim - her boyfriend - wanted them dropped? The Crown Prosecution Service is under obligation to investigate all domestic violence incidents if they believe they are in the public interest. For years there has been growing concern that too few domestic violence cases end in prosecution. Many involve women who have been attacked by their husbands who later withdraw their original accusations under duress or because they are simply living in fear. To try and address this, the CPS introduced reforms in 2014 aimed at greatly increasing prosecution rates. They issued guidance to police urging them to gather multiple sources of evidence rather than just relying on the victim's statement - which may be unreliable or change. One of the most important sources of evidence in domestic abuse cases is likely to be the original 999 call made by the victim shortly after the attack. Other evidence could include witness statements from neighbours, medical examinations or images from the scene captured on police bodycams or CCTV. Miss Flack was understood to be horrified by the prospect of a 'show trial' over the alleged assault on her boyfriend Lewis Burton and was worried she could not cope with the fallout.

Her advisers told her not to post the message but her family have now decided to release it through the Norwich-based Eastern Daily Press newspaper.

The former Love Island host was found dead in her east London flat on Saturday, the day after she had been told that the CPS was pursuing the court case against her.

She had pleaded not guilty to assault by beating at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court in North London on December 23 and was due to go on trial at March 4.

But Miss Flack's management company criticised the CPS for pressing ahead with what it called her 'show trial' even after Mr Burton said he did not support it.

In an Instagram post on January 30, Flack promised to 'speak today' and said her and her family's life was 'no longer up for entertainment or gossip', but no further statement was made.

Speaking about the unpublished message, Flack's mother Chris said: 'Carrie sent me this message at the end of January but was told not to post it by advisers but she so wanted to have her little voice heard.

'So many untruths were out there but this is how she felt and my family and I would like people to read her own words.

'Carrie was surrounded by love and friends but this was just too much for her.

'Her friends Molly, Lou, Sam, Liam and Simon need a very special mention and lots of thanks for trying so hard to keep her safe.'

Mrs Flack added: 'Jody, her twin sister, was there her whole life for her but this time nothing could take away the hurt of such injustice

'As Carrie would say: ""In a nasty world, just be kind"".'

Mrs Flack added: 'It was describing how she was feeling and what she had gone through - no more than that. It was not blaming anyone or pointing any fingers.

'We want people to read it and want it to be shared through the EDP who we really trust and always have done.'

Mollie Grosberg, a TV producer, posted this picture of Caroline Flack in an Instagram story. It is be the last picture of Flack, taken on Valentine's Day

In an Instagram post on January 30, Flack promised to 'speak today' and said her and her family's life 'is no longer up for entertainment or gossip', but no further statement was made

Tributes left outside Flack's former home in Islington following her death on Saturday. The TV star had moved out of the property and put it up for sale following her arrest, and was living in a new flat in Stoke Newington when she died

Lewis Burton posted a photo of himself and Caroline Flack on Instagram on Valentine's Day, despite a court ban on contact between the pair

Mrs Flack said she had received a text from her daughter on Friday after the CPS decision and friends had been with her later in the day.

Mrs Flack said she and Miss Flack's sister Jody had both been due see her on Saturday.

Caroline Flack was tormented over jury being shown police 'bodycam' footage Caroline Flack was said to have been tormented over the idea of a jury being shown police 'bodycam' footage taken during the night she was accused of attacking her boyfriend. The distraught TV presenter was understood to be horrified by the prospect of a 'show trial' over an alleged assault on Lewis Burton and was worried she could not cope with the fallout. Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court in North London had heard in December that police found the pair at her flat in Islington covered in blood and that Miss Flack had cuts to her wrist. Miss Flack had hoped the trial would not go ahead. Friends said she was left feeling isolated and scared and was prescribed anti-depressants. One said: 'Her biggest fear was that the bodycam footage would be made public. She realised that it was going to be shown in court if it came to court. 'She felt that from that moment her life would be ruined forever. I hear that the footage is quite distressing.'

It was revealed yesterday how Flack had undergone two risk assessments to find out if her bail conditions of not being allowed to contact her boyfriend could be varied.

Under the Offender Assessment System introduced in 2001, there are two main risks considered - of future re-offending, and of serious harm to themselves or others.

But the court heard how, even though her risk factor had been downgraded from 'high' to 'medium,' she could not see him until at least after the March appearance.

At the court in December, prosecutor Katie Weiss said police had lowered the risk level against Mr Burton, but the CPS still opposed removing the bail conditions.

A 'medium' risk level means the offender is unlikely to cause serious harm unless there is a change in circumstances, such as relationship breakdown or drug misuse.

Former CPS chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal said prosecutors could halt proceedings if the risk to the defendant's health outweighed a public interest in them standing trial.

But Mr Afzal added that they were under pressure to pursue convictions for domestic violence amid concerns that too many prosecutions were dropped.

The former Love Island presenter killed herself just hours after she learned prosecutors had decided to press ahead with the court case, with her trial just over a fortnight away.

CPS lawyers decided to prosecute Miss Flack even after Mr Burton asked police not to proceed. A court was told she hit him over the head with a lamp.

Known as an 'evidence-led prosecution', it would have relied not on his testimony but on material gathered by police such as bodycam footage taken at her home.

Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court heard that, in the aftermath of the alleged incident, Miss Flack told police 'I did it' then warned she would kill herself.

Miss Flack posted a series of pictures with her dog Ruby in her final Instagram post on Friday

Flack's inquest opened this morning, four days after the television presenter was found dead at her home in east London.

Coroner's officer Sandra Polson said police were driving through Northwold Road, Stoke Newington, on Saturday when they were flagged down.

She said Ms Flack was 'found lying on her back, she had apparently been found hanging'.

Police attempted resuscitation, which was then continued by paramedics, but she was pronounced dead at the scene.

Her body was identified by her sister, Jody Flack. The inquest heard the provisional cause of death was given as suspension by ligature.

The hearing, which lasted four minutes, was adjourned until August 5.

Flack's death, confirmed on Saturday evening, was the latest connected to ITV2's Love Island and prompted a tidal wave of grief from celebrity friends and members of the public.

Flack stepped down from presenting the current winter series after the alleged assault on Mr Burton.

She pleaded not guilty at a court hearing in December and was released on bail.

But she was ordered to stop having any contact with Mr Burton ahead of a trial, which had been due to begin in March.

The full message that Caroline Flack wrote and was advised not to post on social media Flack's mother shared the message in her local paper, the Eastern Daily Press, in Norfolk where Flack grew up. For a lot of people, being arrested for common assault is an extreme way to have some sort of spiritual awakening but for me it's become the normal. I've been pressing the snooze button on many stresses in my life - for my whole life. I've accepted shame and toxic opinions on my life for over 10 years and yet told myself it's all part of my job. No complaining. The problem with brushing things under the carpet is .... they are still there and one day someone is going to lift that carpet up and all you are going to feel is shame and embarrassment. On December the 12th 2019 I was arrested for common assault on my boyfriend... Within 24 hours my whole world and future was swept from under my feet and all the walls that I had taken so long to build around me, collapsed. I am suddenly on a different kind of stage and everyone is watching it happen. I have always taken responsibility for what happened that night. Even on the night. But the truth is... It was an accident. I've been having some sort of emotional breakdown for a very long time. But I am NOT a domestic abuser. We had an argument and an accident happened. An accident. The blood that someone SOLD to a newspaper was MY blood and that was something very sad and very personal. The reason I am talking today is because my family can't take anymore. I've lost my job. My home. My ability to speak. And the truth has been taken out of my hands and used as entertainment. I can't spend every day hidden away being told not to say or speak to anyone. I'm so sorry to my family for what I have brought upon them and for what my friends have had to go through. I'm not thinking about 'how I'm going to get my career back.' I'm thinking about how I'm going to get mine and my family's life back.

Caroline Flack's assault charge was based on a 'SCRATCH': CPS pressed on with case despite only a tiny wound on boyfriend Lewis Burton's head 'while knowing blood in room was TV star's'

Caroline Flack was being prosecuted despite her boyfriend Lewis Burton suffering only a minor injury on his head, it has been claimed.

Former professional tennis player Mr Burton had told police and the Crown Prosecution Service not to go ahead with an assault charge against Flack, 40, who took her own life at her London home on Saturday.

A picture of Mr Burton taken after the incident shows how he was not the victim of a serious assault - and prosecutors knew all along that the blood around the bedroom was from a wound Flack inflicted on herself, it has been claimed.

Flack had been hauled into custody after spending 12 hours and hospital and faced questioning while hungover, exhausted and mentally unstable, the Sun reports.

Shortly before her death the ex-Love Island presenter had been told she would face trial for the charge, which she denied and Mr Burton did not agree with.

It is claimed Caroline Flack was hauled into custody after spending 12 hours and hospital and faced questioning while hungover, exhausted and mentally unstable. Pictured is Flack leaving Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court on December 23, 2019

An inquest into her death is due to begin today.

A source close to Flack said: 'She was clearly unfit to be questioned and should have been given psychiatric help instead of a grilling.'

The source said that a picture showing Mr Burton's head immediately following the incident 'clearly' showed there was 'no head injury so there was no ''violent attack'' with a lamp as claimed by the CPS'.

The source said Flack was not mentally well, was exhausted and been been 'drinking heavily', even telling officers at the time she might take her own life.

Questions have been raised about the Crown Prosecution Service's decision to pursue a court case against the former Love Island presenter.

Former professional tennis player Mr Burton had told police and the Crown Prosecution Service not to go ahead with an assault charge against Flack, 40, who took her own life at her London home on Saturday

Francis Ridley, of her management company Money Talent Management, had said following her passing: 'The Crown Prosecution Service pursued this when they knew not only how very vulnerable Caroline was but also that the alleged victim did not support the prosecution and had disputed the CPS version of events.

'The CPS should look at themselves today and how they pursued a show trial that was not only without merit but not in the public interest.

'And ultimately resulted in significant distress to Caroline. Our thoughts are with Caroline's family at this time.

'An immensely talented young woman who was at the top of her game professionally and loved by television viewers across the country. In recent months Caroline had been under huge pressure because of an ongoing case and potential trial which has been well reported.'

450,Caroline Flack: police still considered her a 'risk' to Lewis Burton,"['Mark Duell', 'Mark Duell For Mailonline']","Caroline Flack underwent two risk assessments to find out if her bail conditions of not being allowed to contact her boyfriend could be varied.

The troubled star killed herself at her home in Stoke Newington, East London, on Saturday while awaiting trial for allegedly attacking her partner Lewis Burton.

She had pleaded not guilty to assault by beating at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court in North London on December 23 and was due to go on trial at March 4.

Under the Offender Assessment System introduced in 2001, there are two main risks considered - of future re-offending, and of serious harm to themselves or others.

But the court heard how, even though her risk factor had been downgraded from 'high' to 'medium,' she could not see him until at least after the March appearance.

At the court in December, prosecutor Katie Weiss said police had lowered the risk level against Mr Burton, but the CPS still opposed removing the bail conditions.

A 'medium' risk level means the offender is unlikely to cause serious harm unless there is a change in circumstances, such as relationship breakdown or drug misuse.

Former CPS chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal said prosecutors could halt proceedings if the risk to the defendant's health outweighed a public interest in them standing trial.

But Mr Afzal added that they were under pressure to pursue convictions for domestic violence amid concerns that too many prosecutions were dropped.

1.9million viewers tune in to first Love Island since presenter's death The first episode of Love Island since the death of Caroline Flack was watched by an average audience of 1.9million viewers on ITV2 last night. The audience of 1,926,900 recorded by TV ratings system Overnights.TV means it was only the 14th most watched episode out of the 35 broadcast during series six so far. The current record audience for this series was 2.4million for the opening night on January 12. The show was not broadcast on Saturday or Sunday.

The former Love Island presenter killed herself just hours after she learned prosecutors had decided to press ahead with the court case, with her trial just over a fortnight away.

CPS lawyers decided to prosecute Miss Flack even after Mr Burton asked police not to proceed. A court was told she hit him over the head with a lamp.

Known as an 'evidence-led prosecution', it would have relied not on his testimony but on material gathered by police such as bodycam footage taken at her home.

Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court heard that, in the aftermath of the alleged incident, Miss Flack told police 'I did it' then warned she would kill herself.

But Miss Flack's management company criticised the CPS for pressing ahead with what it called her 'show trial' even after Mr Burton said he did not support it.

Lawyers have said prosecutors may have pressed ahead with assault charges against Miss Flack due to high public concern around domestic violence.

Why did the CPS pursue the assault charges when the alleged victim - her boyfriend - wanted them dropped? The Crown Prosecution Service is under obligation to investigate all domestic violence incidents if they believe they are in the public interest. For years there has been growing concern that too few domestic violence cases end in prosecution. Many involve women who have been attacked by their husbands who later withdraw their original accusations under duress or because they are simply living in fear. To try and address this, the CPS introduced reforms in 2014 aimed at greatly increasing prosecution rates. They issued guidance to police urging them to gather multiple sources of evidence rather than just relying on the victim's statement - which may be unreliable or change. One of the most important sources of evidence in domestic abuse cases is likely to be the original 999 call made by the victim shortly after the attack. Other evidence could include witness statements from neighbours, medical examinations or images from the scene captured on police bodycams or CCTV. Miss Flack was understood to be horrified by the prospect of a 'show trial' over the alleged assault on her boyfriend Lewis Burton and was worried she could not cope with the fallout.

Former director of public prosecutions Lord Macdonald said there would generally be 'a strong presumption' that bringing charges in any domestic violence case would be in the public interest.

He said: 'There is a high public interest presumption in favour of prosecution in domestic violence cases because domestic violence is such a common crime and it's a dangerous crime.

'We have about 170 or 180 people every year, mainly women, who are killed during domestic violence incidents. There is a huge amount of public concern about these offences.

'Generally, there would be a strong public interest presumption in favour of prosecuting a domestic violence case where there is enough evidence to do so.'

Miss Flack's agent Francis Ridley, of Money Talent Management, said: 'In recent months Caroline had been under huge pressure because of an ongoing case and potential trial which has been well reported.

'The Crown Prosecution Service pursued this when they knew not only how very vulnerable Caroline was but also that the alleged victim did not support the prosecution and had disputed the CPS version of events.

Caroline Flack was tormented over jury being shown police 'bodycam' footage Caroline Flack was said to have been tormented over the idea of a jury being shown police 'bodycam' footage taken during the night she was accused of attacking her boyfriend. The distraught TV presenter was understood to be horrified by the prospect of a 'show trial' over an alleged assault on Lewis Burton and was worried she could not cope with the fallout. Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court in North London had heard in December that police found the pair at her flat in Islington covered in blood and that Miss Flack had cuts to her wrist. Miss Flack had hoped the trial would not go ahead. Friends said she was left feeling isolated and scared and was prescribed anti-depressants. One said: 'Her biggest fear was that the bodycam footage would be made public. She realised that it was going to be shown in court if it came to court. 'She felt that from that moment her life would be ruined forever. I hear that the footage is quite distressing.'

To try to address this, the CPS introduced reforms in 2014 aimed at greatly increasing prosecution rates.

Sean Joyce, head of criminal justice at Stephensons Solicitors LLP, criticised the CPS over the prosecution for having a 'one size fits all' policy.

Ms Flack was banned from speaking to her boyfriend before the trial, and Mr Joyce said that enforced separation can sometimes do more harm than good.

He said: 'The current CPS approach is too much of a one size fits all policy, it must give greater thought to individual circumstances.

'The enforced separation between parties, in individual cases, as highlighted here, often prevents reconciliation and can do more harm than good. It's important that the CPS takes the time to reflect on this.

'If as a country we want a criminal justice system that provides justice to all parties, including the alleged victims and perpetrators of domestic violence, then it needs to be properly resourced.

'At the moment, the police, prosecution and courts often don't have the time or the money to consider properly the complex issues raised by domestic violence.

'Perversely, this can lead to inappropriate cases proceeding to trial when a robust review at an early stage would have prevented this.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8015499/Caroline-Flacks-team-pleaded-courts-reassess-charges.html

The former One Direction star, 26, was out in Hampstead, in the north of the capital, when he was confronted and threatened by a man who pulled a knife on him.

The thug demanded cash from the singer and Styles quickly complied, managing to get away unharmed.

A source said the singer 'played it cool' and kept calm despite his attacker's blade.

But they added he was 'shaken up' by the robbery, which came just hours before his ex-girlfriend Caroline Flack was found dead at her London home.

On Styles' frightening mugging, the source told the Mirror: 'He actually played it pretty cool, quickly giving the assailant cash, keeping himself and the guy calm and getting the situation over with.

'Understandably though it left him very shaken up afterwards.

'Given how Caroline took her own life the next day, the pressures of a new album and a performance at the BRIT Awards this evening, it's fair to say this is the last thing poor old Harry needed.'

Styles' mother Anne Twist took to Twitter on Saturday posting: 'Heartbreaking #ripcarolineflack'.

The inquest heard the provisional cause of death was given as suspension by ligature. The hearing, which lasted four minutes, was adjourned until August 5.

In the post released by her family today, Flack revealed that she had been having 'some sort of emotional breakdown for a very long time' and that she and her family 'could not take it anymore'.

The 40-year-old had planned to post the message on social media and had shown it to her mother at the end of January, but was advised not to share it with her millions of followers.

The full message that Caroline Flack wrote and was advised not to post on social media Flack's mother shared the message in her local paper, the Eastern Daily Press, in Norfolk where Flack grew up. For a lot of people, being arrested for common assault is an extreme way to have some sort of spiritual awakening but for me it's become the normal. I've been pressing the snooze button on many stresses in my life - for my whole life. I've accepted shame and toxic opinions on my life for over 10 years and yet told myself it's all part of my job. No complaining. The problem with brushing things under the carpet is .... they are still there and one day someone is going to lift that carpet up and all you are going to feel is shame and embarrassment. On December the 12th 2019 I was arrested for common assault on my boyfriend... Within 24 hours my whole world and future was swept from under my feet and all the walls that I had taken so long to build around me, collapsed. I am suddenly on a different kind of stage and everyone is watching it happen. I have always taken responsibility for what happened that night. Even on the night. But the truth is... It was an accident. I've been having some sort of emotional breakdown for a very long time. But I am NOT a domestic abuser. We had an argument and an accident happened. An accident. The blood that someone SOLD to a newspaper was MY blood and that was something very sad and very personal. The reason I am talking today is because my family can't take anymore. I've lost my job. My home. My ability to speak. And the truth has been taken out of my hands and used as entertainment. I can't spend every day hidden away being told not to say or speak to anyone. I'm so sorry to my family for what I have brought upon them and for what my friends have had to go through. I'm not thinking about 'how I'm going to get my career back.' I'm thinking about how I'm going to get mine and my family's life back.

Flack stepped down from presenting the current winter series of Love Island after an alleged assault on boyfriend Lewis Burton.

The TV star pleaded not guilty at a court hearing in December and was released on bail.

But she was ordered to stop having any contact with Burton ahead of a trial which had been due to begin in March.

454,EU: UK might have to return ELGIN MARBLES to get trade deal,"['James Tapsfield', 'Political Editor For Mailonline']","The EU today suggested the Elgin Marbles will be the price of a trade deal - as Michel Barnier dismissed the UK's call for a Canada-style agreement.

The bloc's post-Brexit negotiating mandate is being extended to include a demand to 'address issues relating to the return or restitution of unlawfully removed cultural objects to their countries of origin'.

The ask is believed to have been added at the request of Greece, Italy and Cyprus - and indicates that Brussels intends to play hardball.

But No 10 hit back tonight, with a source saying: 'This is just not happening and it shows a troubling lack of seriousness about the negotiations on the part of the EU.'

Meanwhile, Mr Barnier told reporters in the Belgian capital that the UK's position was 'not like Canada', after Boris Johnson signalled he wants the same terms as the north American country.

Mr Barnier swiped at the 'polemic' coming out of Britain, saying: 'We have proposed a trade agreement with a country that has a very particular and unique close geographical proximity not like Canada, not like South Korea and not like Japan. Very particular.'

The tough stance set the stage for a huge battle when negotiations get under way formally next month.

Greek diplomats told Bloomberg the clause on 'cultural objects' was to do with smuggling of artefacts, but another other official suggested it was a reference to the ancient Greek statues in the British Museum, which were taken from the Parthenon in Athens at the start of the 19th century.

The Elgin Marbles are a collection of classical Greek marble sculptures, inscriptions and architectural members that were mostly created by Phidias and his assistants

Boris Johnson (pictured) signalled he wants the same trade terms with the EU as Canada

Mr Johnson is already facing the threat that Spain will try to use the negotiations to reopen questions over Gibraltar.

Many Parthenon sculptures have been housed in the British Museum since 1816 after they were bought by the government from Lord Elgin.

Greece has long campaigned for their repatriation, and some UK politicians including Jeremy Corbyn have backed returning them.

But the government insists they were purchased legitimately and have been painstakingly preserved in the UK.

There have been warnings that giving back the artefacts would trigger requests from dozens of other countries for the repatriation of artworks in British museums.

The sculptures used to be on the Parthenon at the top of the Acropolis in Athens.

A LONG-RUNNING HISTORICAL DISPUTE: WHAT ARE THE ELGIN MARBLES? The Elgin Marbles are a collection of classical Greek marble sculptures, inscriptions and architectural members that were mostly created by Phidias and his assistants. The 7th Earl of Elgin, Thomas Bruce, removed the Parthenon Marble pieces from the Acropolis in Athens while serving as the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1799 to 1803. In 1801, the Earl claimed to have obtained a permit from the Ottoman authorities to remove pieces from the Parthenon. As the Acropolis was still an Ottoman military fort, Elgin required permission to enter the site. His agents subsequently removed half of the surviving sculptures, as well as architectural members and sculpture from the Propylaea and Erechtheum. The excavation and removal was completed in 1812 at a personal cost of around £70,000. The sculptures were shipped to Britain, but in Greece, the Scots aristocrat was accused of looting and vandalism. They were bought by the British Government in 1816 and placed in the British Museum. They still stand on view in the purpose-built Duveen Gallery. Greece has sought their return from the British Museum through the years, to no avail. The authenticity of Elgin's permit to remove the sculptures from the Parthenon has been widely disputed, especially as the original document has been lost. Many claim it was not legal. However, others argue that since the Ottomans had controlled Athens since 1460, their claims to the artefacts were legal and recognisable.

They were removed by Elgin between 1799 and 1810 after he received permission from the Ottoman empire, which ruled Greece at the time.

Elgin claimed he was worried about damage being done to the marbles, but their removal was criticised at the time by figures including Lord Byron.

According to a House of Commons briefing paper from 2017, the UK government's position is that 'issues relating to the ownership and management of the Parthenon sculptures are matters for the trustees of the British Museum'.

Last night Mr Johnson's Brexit negotiator David Frost said the UK would rather walk away from talks than accept anything that interfered with 'the fundamentals of what it means to be an independent country'.

The EU is insisting that there can be no 'divergence' from its rules and regulations in areas including financial services and agriculture.

But Mr Frost used a speech Brussels to warn that the hardline position against this already espoused by the Prime Minister was not just posturing.

He made clear the UK wanted a Canada-style trade deal.

But he added that the UK is 'ready for an 'Australia-style' arrangement, with no comprehensive trade deal, if those terms are not granted.

He pointed out that if the UK and EU roles were reversed and the EU was forced to follow Westminster laws 'democratic consent would snap – dramatically and finally'.

Mr Frost told students and academics at the Université libre de Bruxelles: 'We bring to the negotiations not some clever tactical positioning but the fundamentals of what it means to be an independent country.

'It is central to our vision that we must have the ability to set laws that suit us – to claim the right that every other non-EU country in the world has.

'So to think that we might accept EU supervision on so called level playing field issues simply fails to see the point of what we are doing.

'It isn't a simple negotiating position which might move under pressure – it is the point of the whole project.

'That's also why we will not extend the transition beyond the end of this year. At that point we recover our political and economic independence in full – why would we want to postpone it?

'In short, we only want what other independent countries have.'

Frost described how he started his early career in the EU hub Brussels as a euro-enthusiast but soon became disillusioned with the bloc's institutions.

He added that it was perfectly possible to be both an economic competitor and political partner with the EU in the future.

He said the UK was 'not asking for anything special', just a normal trade agreement that the EU has with other countries around the world.

His defiant speech came after French foreign minister Jean-Yves le Drian predicted a bruising battle on a post-Brexit deal.

David Frost said the UK would rather walk away from talks than accept anything that interfered with 'the fundamentals of what it means to be an independent country'

Speaking at the annual Munich Security Conference, he made clear that Brussels will defend its interests when negotiations begin next month.

'I think that on trade issues and the mechanism for future relations, which we are going to start on, we are going to rip each other apart,' he said.

'But that is part of negotiations, everyone will defend their own interests.'

Mr le Drian, a close ally of president Emmanuel Macron, is the latest senior EU figure to warn that the negotiations will be difficult.

European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and Mr Barnier have both cast doubt on Boris Johnson's aim to reach a comprehensive agreement by the end of the year when the Brexit transition period runs out.

The EU has repeatedly warned Britain cannot expect to enjoy continued 'high-quality' market access if it insists on diverging from EU social and environmental standards.

There is expected to be a particularly tough fight over fishing rights, with the EU insisting continued access to UK waters must form part of any agreement.

The bloc's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said the EU's top priorities are fishing, security and maintaining fair trading conditions for European companies. A fishing boat is pictured above in the English channel

London Mayor Sadiq Khan demands Britons get the right to 'opt in' for EU citizenship despite Brexit

Sadiq Khan has begged the EU to grant pro-Remain Britons 'associate citizenship' of the bloc so they can continue to enjoy the benefits of free movement despite Brexit.

The Mayor of London travelled to Brussels today for crunch talks with the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.

He is calling on the UK and EU to discuss his plans when the two sides sit down in the coming months for negotiations on the terms of their future relationship.

Mr Khan argued his plan would help reconcile Leave and Remain voters and help pro-EU voters who 'still feel and want to be European'.

However, the EU will almost certainly dismiss the call because it is likely to fall into the category of 'cherry picking' - wanting some of the advantages of membership without taking on all of the obligations.

Mr Khan tweeted: 'It's no secret I wanted to remain in the EU, but I'm determined to ensure London thrives after Brexit.

'Today I'm in Brussels, meeting senior EU leaders to fight for a deal that protects London's economy, and the rights of all Londoners.'

The Mayor's 'associate citizenship' plan would allow British voters who opt in to keep many of the rights they held before Brexit - including the right to move freely between EU member states.

Mayor of London Sadiq Khan met with the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels today

The pair discussed Mr Khan's proposals to allow pro-Remain Britons to be given 'associate citizenship' of the EU

He said: 'Like so many Londoners, I am heartbroken that we are no longer a member of the European Union, but that doesn't mean our country's future can't be closely linked with the rest of Europe.

'The Prime Minister says his job is to bring the country together and move us forward and I cannot think of a better way of reconciling the differences between British voters who wanted to leave, and the millions of Londoners and British nationals who still feel and want to be European.

'There would be support from millions of Londoners and British nationals who are devastated they are losing their rights as EU citizens.

'As the UK and EU start their next phase of negotiations, I want this issue of associate citizenship to be at the heart of talks about our future relationship.'

Mr Khan met Mr Barnier for talks as well as David Sassoli, the president of the European Parliament.

Mr Khan also met with former chairman of the European Parliament's Brexit steering group Guy Verhofstadt who has previously called for 'associate citizenship' to be offered to the UK

Mr Khan said the meeting with Mr Sassoli was 'productive' and it is 'vital that we work together to retain close ties after Brexit'.

Mr Sassoli described the sit down as a 'fruitful exchange' as he said protecting citizens' rights is a 'key priority' for the European Parliament.

The mayor also met with Guy Verhofstadt, the former chairman of the European Parliament's Brexit steering group, who has previously advocated a similar plan.

Mr Verhofstadt is urging Brussels decision makers to be open to the concept of 'associate citizenship'.

'The Maastricht Treaty created the concept of ""European citizenship"" and I am in favour of using this now as a basis for people who want to keep their link with Europe,' he said.

'It is the first time in the history of our union that a member state leaves, but it is not because the UK government wanted exit that individual citizens have to lose their connection with the continent.'

However, Mr Khan's plan was immediately attacked by his London mayor challengers Rory Stewart and Shaun Bailey.

Mr Khan also met president of the European Parliament David Sassoli. The mayor's proposals would see UK citizens able to keep free movement rights despite Brexit

Mr Stewart, who is standing as an independent candidate at the contest in May this year, said 'associate citizenship' was 'only a sound bite' and the 'policy cannot work'.

Mr Bailey, the Tory candidate, slammed it as a 'gimmick' and told Mr Khan to 'focus on his actual responsibilities'.

The UK left the EU on January 31 this year and the two sides are now in a standstill transition period lasting until the end of 2020 during which they will try to hammer out the terms of their future relationship.

Freedom of movement will continue to apply to the UK for the duration of the transition period with the UK's new border control system due to be rolled out in January 2021.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8016687/EU-warns-returning-ELGIN-MARBLES-price-trade-deal.html
455,Children are found dead in a vehicle after being severely burned in an out-of-control blaze,"['Brittany Chain', 'Daniel Piotrowski For Daily Mail Australia']","A father who torched his estranged wife's car with their three children inside escaped the inferno and stabbed himself to death as he watched his kids die.

Rowan Charles Baxter's three children, Aaliyah, six, Laianah, four, and Trey, three, all died when the family's white SUV was set alight at Camp Hill, in Brisbane's south east, at about 8.20am on Wednesday.

Hannah Baxter, the children's mother, 31, died late on Tuesday night from horrific burns. She had leaped out of the Kia Sportage in flames and was extinguished by neighbours before being rushed to hospital.

Baxter, a 42-year-old former NRL player, jumped in the car as Ms Baxter strapped the children in to do the school drop off while parked down the road from her parents' home.

Aaron Snell, a neighbour who witnessed the horror said he initially thought he was watching a road rage attack before he realised the gravity of the situation.

By the time he reacted, Ms Baxter had escaped from the car and was rolling on the footpath in an attempt to smother the flames. A Good Samaritan was also trying to hose her down to stop the fire.

Witnesses said they heard her shouting 'he's poured petrol on me' at the time.

Baxter was also still alive.

The blaze occurred in Camp Hill, described as an upmarket, family-oriented suburb in Brisbane's east

BRISBANE CAR INFERNO: HOW THE BLAZE UNFOLDED Early Wednesday morning: Witnesses reported seeing Rowan Charles Baxter filling a jerry can with fuel at a local service station. Wednesday 8am: Rowan Charles Baxter dived into his estranged wife's car as she was preparing to do the school drop off. He doused them all in petrol and set the car alight. Neighbours reported hearing an explosion which sounded like a 'gas bottle' blast. At least four explosions followed. Following the blast: Ms Baxter was able to escape the burning car and screamed: 'He's poured petrol on me.' Horrified witnesses saw her skin peeling off her body. One heroic neighbour began hosing her down in an attempt to save her life. She was rushed to Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital in a critical condition. A second neighbour told Daily Mail Australia he had spoken with a man who tried to rescue the children. The man said he noticed babies in the car and was crying. Young tradesmen at a building site down the road rushed to the scene with timber to stop the car, which began rolling after the initial blast. Wendy Antoniou, who lives several houses up, told Daily Mail Australia: 'I thought something had landed on my roof, it was like BANG - I could feel the vibration.' 'I came around the side window - well, I nearly bloody died. The fire brigade was everywhere, ambulance was everywhere. Early Wednesday evening: Ms Baxter died in hospital from the injuries she sustained in the blast.

He was across the road, but returned to the car to salvage a knife. He then stabbed himself in the chest, Mr Snell said.

Mr Snell, who is trained in CPR, said he was trying to assess whether he could perform it on Baxter because he was 'just in all matter of states,' he told The Courier Mail.

'As I came to the front after calling Triple-0, I saw her (Hannah). She was smoking, her body was smoking and on fire,' Mr Snell said.

By this point, others were on the scene and trying to put out the fire in an attempt to save the children, who were still trapped inside.

Mr Snell believes Baxter attempted to stop them helping his children in his final moments.

'He was so angry and just going absolutely crazy. It appeared like he wanted [the car] to burn,' he said.

Queensland Police officers were called to a family violence incident allegedly involving the couple just last month

Baxter described himself as an accomplished body weight trainer, while his wife said she 'was an enthusiastic, passionate mother of three'

CONFRONTING FOOTAGE SHOWS ROWAN BAXTER PRETENDING TO BREAK HIS SON'S NECK Confronting footage has since surfaced of the father roughing his children up during a play fight in happier times. In the vision, which Baxter uploaded to his Facebook account about a month ago, the three children giggled as he took turns grabbing them by the neck and pushing them away from him. Trey, who was still in diapers at the time, eventually grew tired of the game after having his head slammed into a bed and ran off camera in tears. Baxter laughed and continued playing with his two older girls. Trey, who was still in diapers at the time, eventually grew tired of the game after having his head slammed into a bed and ran off camera in tears The video was met with messages of support from his friends, who said he was teaching his children to have a thick skin. 'That is the coolest bro. Kids love being roughed up then they don’t cry over every little thing. Awesome what you are doing,' one said. That same friend has since described Baxter's reported actions as 'inexcusable'. 'What he has done is the saddest thing ever and inexcusable... I have nothing but good memories of the man and no one could have foreseen this happening. RIP to the little ones,' he wrote underneath his original comment. Baxter indicated the footage was taken just before bed time. 'Sweet dreams my babies... love you to the moon and back,' he wrote.

Baxter, an ex-New Zealand Warriors player, stabbed himself with a knife during the horrific attack on his family.

The couple had recently separated and shut down the business they ran together, Integr8 Fitness, based at Capalaba.

The car blaze occurred just metres from Hannah's parents' house.

In recent months, Baxter flooded his Facebook site with photos and videos of his children, describing them as 'my world'.

'T-R-E-Y, love you to the moon and back,' he posted six days ago.

'Goodnight my babies, Daddy loves you,' he posted a month ago.

Weightlifting friend Joey Abraham wrote to Baxter four days ago: 'Chin up brother everything will work out just hang in there my bro.

'A lot of people care about you and the situation you're facing.'

A reeling Mr Abraham told Daily Mail Australia after the incident: 'Rowan was in a real bad place there for a bit because of the separation.

'If you knew Rowan when he at his best and to see him like last week then you know how far he'd fallen.

456,Prince Andrew's sorrowful 60th: A haunting insight into the Duke's celebration,"['Richard Kay', 'Richard Kay And Geoffrey Levy For The Daily Mail']","The Queen was at her most relaxed. Casually dressed in a red twinset, her smile for the camera displaying a happy monarch at peace with life. Click, click. Taking the pictures was her son, Andrew. The occasion was her 60th birthday.

He was 26. Friends recall him marvelling at his mother and wondering 'what I'll be like at 60'. Now we know.

There will be no easy smiles for the cameras as Prince Andrew reaches that milestone today. At 60, he should be approaching an age where he is seen as one of the Royal Family's elder statesmen, a prince of experience respected by the people, admired by the new generations of royals.

Instead, he faces a future of ignominy. Even as he walks his daughter, Beatrice, up the aisle in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace at the end of May, the congregation's curious eyes will be as much on him as on the bride.

We do not need to ask how it has come to this, how the Queen's favourite son has sacrificed the nation's respect.

It wasn't his love of women, but his love of money that brought him into the unsavoury company of the multi-millionaire Jeffrey Epstein.

There will be no easy smiles for the cameras as Prince Andrew reaches that milestone today (pictured with the Queen in January)

As he confessed so naively in the Newsnight interview that brought about his downfall, the most important aspect of his friendship with the American sex offender was his dinner parties that brought him close to important people.

How different this anniversary should have been. A lover of military gold braid, like all the royals, Andrew should have celebrated his birthday being decorated with the accoutrements of a full admiral (on his 55th birthday he was raised merely to vice-admiral).

Clearly, this further elevation could never have taken place with things being as they are, but he was allowed to let it be known that he had 'deferred' the honour, which is in the gift of his mother.

Flags to mark his birthday would have been flying from public buildings the length and breadth of the land. Now they will not, though the bells of Westminster Abbey will ring to mark the occasion.

It wasn't his love of women, but his love of money that brought him into the unsavoury company of the multi-millionaire Jeffrey Epstein (pictured)

Just imagine the look on his face at the birthday party the Queen was to have given him at Buckingham Palace, as guests raised their glasses to his good health.

There will be a celebration, but nothing on the scale originally planned: instead of Buckingham Palace there is a family dinner at Royal Lodge, his home in Windsor Great Park, for about a dozen, while a group of friends have said they want to organise something, too.

But it is one thing to lay on an event and quite another to find a sufficient number of guests to attend it. Shakespeare's Diary in the Mail yesterday revealed that additional invitations had to be sent out for the Royal Lodge dinner after a number of guests discovered they were 'unavailable'.

So what people will be thinking of Prince Andrew on his 60th birthday is: where does he go from here?

His withdrawal from public life couldn't have come at a worse time for the royals, with Harry and Meghan now decidedly off the scene.

But few believe this will hasten his return to formal duties. 'He could be out of circulation for years,' is the view of one senior figure. 'So long as Epstein's name is in the air, Andrew's will be associated with him.'

He will, of course, lean on Fergie, the ex-wife from whom he has never truly parted and who has always been happy to lean on him.

At 40, he was being given a landmark birthday party by the Queen at Windsor Castle at which the guests included Ghislaine Maxwell (pictured), who was accompanied by a certain Jeffrey Epstein

At the one official function he has attended — a dinner to mark Chinese New Year hosted by China's ambassador at his official residence — Fergie accompanied him.

That evening apart, he has spent most of his time in Royal Lodge. To add to his woes, the weather has been so wet that he has hardly been able to expel his frustrations on the golf course. Not that he particularly wishes to be seen. 'We call it being in the bunker,' says one of his circle. 'His main priority is protecting the children.'

Meanwhile, it is deeply ironic that a sparkling new property now stands on the site of Sunninghill Park, the former marital home given to him and Fergie by the Queen as a wedding present and where they lived when Beatrice and her sister, Eugenie, were small.

If ever a deal was the precursor to Andrew's troubles, it was the curious case of the £15 million that Kazakhstan oligarch Timur Kulibayev paid him for it, when his asking price was only £12 million.

But then, these were the kind of people with whom Andrew spent so much of his time. The sale enabled him to buy the £13 million skiing chalet in Verbier, in the Swiss Alps, that was registered in his and his ex-wife's joint names. Usually he would have been there by now, but Verbier is a place where one is 'seen' and inevitably photographed by the paparazzi.

'Andrew is very bruised by what has happened so it's not surprising if he's become rather withdrawn,' says one of his old friends.

One place from which he has not withdrawn is Buckingham Palace. He is the only one of the Queen's children who still has an apartment as well as an office at 'Buck House' and has been there frequently.

But, like his diary, his office is now empty, the staff gone, including Amanda Thirsk, the devoted private secretary who is said to have played a decisive role in convincing him that doing the Emily Maitlis interview was a good idea.

She is now running Pitch@Palace, Andrew's 'Dragons' Den' style project, which connects start-up firms, mainly in the technology sector, with investors.

She is doing it without the man who dreamed it up: Andrew. Even his name has been deleted from the home page of its website.

Pitch, according to one senior palace figure, was 'a neat invention that created the impression that he was still a trade envoy for Britain, a vehicle for him travelling the world. And, of course, it all showed up in the Court Circular, which made him look busy.'

In many ways, Pitch replaced his much-loved role as an international trade envoy which he lost in 2011. The line between his official position and his private interests were in danger of becoming blurred, and the Epstein scandal sealed his fate. What is now also certain is that Andrew will never realise his dream of getting Pitch into the U.S.

Who would have imagined such a scenario when the Prince was growing up? After all, he was a boy who actually enjoyed schooldays at Gordonstoun, which Prince Charles hated so much he famously dubbed it 'Colditz in kilts'

So the future does look rather bleak for the Duke of York, though for how long no one knows.

Who would have imagined such a scenario when the Prince was growing up? After all, he was a boy who actually enjoyed schooldays at Gordonstoun, which Prince Charles hated so much he famously dubbed it 'Colditz in kilts'.

By 20, Andrew had already been in the Navy a year at the start of a distinguished career, the highlight of which was his service as a helicopter pilot during the Falklands war, flying dangerous decoy missions luring Argentine missiles away from the Fleet.

At 30, he was about to become a father for the second time after four years of marriage to the former Sarah Ferguson.

At 40, he was being given a landmark birthday party by the Queen at Windsor Castle at which the guests included Ghislaine Maxwell, who was accompanied by a certain Jeffrey Epstein.

His marriage having ended in 1996, he was said to be going through a mid-life crisis, dating a series of pretty girls and visiting nightclubs. Within a year of his 40th he had left the Navy with the rank of Commander, and before long had eagerly taken up the offer to be a trade envoy for Britain.

Ten years later, at 50, he was about to lose his trade role and Fergie was back living with him at the Queen Mother's former home, Royal Lodge, which he had inherited and refurbished. So far, so good.

Now, as he turns 60, Fergie remains under his roof and Epstein, though dead, remains a constant reminder of his lack of judgment. As will public perception of the infamous photograph allegedly showing the Prince with one of Epstein's victims, Virginia Roberts. Andrew denies any wrong-doing.

One is entitled to wonder whether Prince Andrew will ever come to see his association with Epstein, who killed himself in a New York prison last summer, in that light. Unlike his elder brother, Charles, Andrew is not a man of introspection. 'He does things and then thinks about it afterwards,' says a courtier.

At 30, he was about to become a father for the second time after four years of marriage to the former Sarah Ferguson

All his life, of course, Andrew has known that he occupies a special place in his mother's affections. Unlike Charles and Anne, who were born when she was still Princess Elizabeth, Andrew was the son who came along when the Queen had reigned for the best part of a decade.

He was named after his paternal grandfather, the dissolute gambler Prince Andrew of Greece, who saw little of his son Prince Philip and died penniless on the French Riviera.

'The Queen knew the ropes by then and was able to give him all the time that Charles says he didn't get,' says a former courtier. 'She so loved looking after him she even curtailed her foreign travel.'

At bath time, she put on an apron and bathed him and she would rock him to sleep. At Windsor Castle he was allowed to race his bicycle down its wide corridors and play skittles along them while his mother dealt with her red boxes of government papers.

On Saturdays at teatime he would sit with his parents — Charles and Anne were away at school — watching the BBC's Grandstand sports programme on television.

'Such maternal closeness has never changed,' says a former lady-in-waiting. 'The Queen always forgave him when he was a child, and his blunders when he was older. They are just as close today as they ever were.'

All of which explains what one friend describes as 'Andrew's despair at what he has inflicted on his mother.'

The greatest shame on his 60th birthday stems from the certain knowledge that, whatever his shortcomings, his mother will always forgive him.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8017975/Prince-Andrews-sorrowful-60th-haunting-insight-Dukes-celebration.html
457,Earl and Countess of Snowdon divorce: assets battle imminent?,"['Amie Gordon', 'David Wilkes For The Daily Mail']","Advertisement

The Queen's nephew David Linley could be set for a battle over millions of pounds in assets with his wife after the pair announced they were set to divorce.

The Earl of Snowdon and his wife Serena, Countess of Snowdon are splitting 'amicably' after some 25 years of marriage.

The Earl, who is 21st in line to the throne, has amassed a fortune of millions and is famously motivated by wealth, once admitting that money 'drives him, and always has.'

The couple and their two children, Charles, Viscount Linley, 20, and Lady Margarita, 17, are understood to divide their time between a flat in Chelsea, a 'tiny' cottage in Gloucestershire and the Chateau d'Autet in Provence.

Serena is the daughter of debutante Virginia Freeman-Jackson and the 12th Earl of Harrington Viscount Petersham, the London landowner reportedly worth up to £250million.

Her husband, meanwhile, owns Chateau d’Autet, a 19th-century French hunting lodge in the foothills of Mount Luberon, France, which he bought for £800,000 in 1998.

He was also bequeathed his late father’s Kensington townhouse. The property in west London's exclusive enclave was bought for Snowdon by the Queen for £70,000 on his divorce and held in trust for his children, and is now thought to be worth £10 million.

The pair are now preparing to divide their combined wealth as they go their separate ways.

The Earl's mother Margaret, the Queen's sister, died in 2002 and he became the 2nd Earl of Snowdon following the death of his father the Earl of Snowdon, celebrity photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones, in 2017.

Princess Margaret's tumultuous marriage to Lord Snowdon On February 26, 1960, Buckingham Palace announced that the Queen had consented to Princess Margaret's engagement to Antony Armstrong-Jones. They were married in Westminster Abbey on May 6 in a ceremony watched on television by more than 300 million people in 13 countries. The couple made their home in an apartment at Kensington Palace and in 1961 their son Viscount Linley was born, followed by daughter Lady Sarah in 1964. But the marriage was dogged by rumours Princess Margaret was having affairs, with rumoured dalliances with Mick Jagger and Warren Beatty. She was also alleged to have dated jazz pianist Robin Douglas Home in 1966. Pictures were also released of her spending time with Roddy Llewellyn on the island of Mustique in 1976. However, in March 1976, it was announced that Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon, as he had become, had decided to separate and their marriage was dissolved on May 24, 1978.

The announcement is the second split to rock the royal household in a week, after the Queen’s grandson Peter Phillips announced he was to separate from his wife Autumn Kelly.

In 1982, Linley founded his bespoke furniture making business, David Linley & Company, later known simply as Linley. The company also provides interior design and upholstery products.

The Daily Mail reported on accounts filed in April 2017 which showed a return to profit for the company, with sales jumping from £6.9million to £13.5million while a loss of £1.9million turned into a profit of £337,000.

The most recent accounts filed with Companies House for the year ended June 2018 show a turnover of £11.1million and profits of about £528,000.

He has furnished yachts for Valentino and the Lebanese-Saudi socialite Mouna Ayoub and the company's client list also includes Sir Elton John and designer Lady Weinberg. He has remained chairman throughout several financial bailouts of the company.

His wife Serena had her own shop in Chelsea’s fashionable Walton Street, called Serena Linley Provence from 2010 until 2014. Her products included a £33 body lotion, Margarita, named after the couple’s daughter, and £46 drawer liners.

But she closed down the firm — which sold scent, soap and perfume made from French lavender — in 2014.

Viscount Linley was understood to be a shareholder in his wife’s business.

The Earl has sparked controversy over the years with the decision to sell

his family's possessions.

He faced a backlash when he sold Les Jolies Eaux, his mother Princess Margaret's home on the Caribbean island of Mustique, while she was still alive.

It was the only property she ever owned and, although the land was a wedding gift from her friend Lord Glenconner, she paid for the building herself.

To her dismay, once the seven years had elapsed to escape inheritance tax, Linley sold it for around £2.1 million in 2000.

Soon after, he splashed some £800,000 on a holiday retreat in the south of France.

He bought the large hunting lodge in the foothills of Mount Luberon, his favourite retreat where he and his wife Serena spent holidays with their children, Charles and Margarita.

It is where photographs were taken by a French paparazzo of the Duchess of Cambridge as she sunbathed topless in 2012.

In 1999, the Earl is understood to have sold a flat in Battersea for a £1million profit and moved into the former apartment of his late mother in Kensington Palace.

Then in 2004, he bought a £1million council-style flat above a row of shops in Chelsea before the couple purchased a £1.25 million Belgravia property, before selling it months later for a rumoured £3million.

In 2002, the couple bought a £2.5 million five-bedroom townhouse in Marylebone, before moving out after an intruder broke in.

The Earl sold Les Jolies Eaux, his mother Princess Margaret’s home on the Caribbean island of Mustique, while she was still alive, for £2.1million in 2000 to a venture capitalist

The Queen, pictured today with the High Commissioner for Zambia Lieutenant General Paul Mihova at Buckingham Palace, is said to be 'saddened' by the news

In 1980, he sold his late mother’s Rolls-Royce, a customised Silver Wraith bought in 1980. The seats were specially upholstered in green cloth rather than leather, and the floor carpeted with green lambswool rugs.

There were spotlights above the rear seat to ensure the Princess could be seen as she was driven at night, and the rear window ledges were covered in leather because she found it distracting to see her reflection in the polished walnut.

The car’s last official outing was to ferry mourners to her funeral at St George’s Chapel, Windsor. Soon afterwards, Linley sold the Rolls to a dealer.

In 2006 he faced further outcry when he and his sister, Lady Sarah Chatto, auctioned their mother’s jewellery and art.

The 800 pieces, including the Poltimore Tiara she wore at her wedding to Lord Snowdon, were billed as being sold to make enough money to pay off an apparent £3million inheritance tax bill on her estate after she died in 2002.

Lasting two days, it made £13,658,000 which, after deductions, Linley shared with his sister, Lady Sarah.

The sale included his mother's favourite portrait of herself, painted by Pietro Annigoni in 1957.

The painting was a sister to Annigoni's portrait of the Queen that hangs in the National Portrait Gallery. The Princess hung it on a wall facing the front door of her apartment at Kensington Palace, a home Lord Linley and his family shared while between homes of their own.

The hammer came down at £680,000 but later, it emerged it had been bought back in the auction by Lord Linley.

It emerged that hidden in the detail, Annigoni had painted a tiny self-portrait and a glass tumbler hanging from a branch and containing a dark heart - undoubtedly Margaret's breaking heart. For she had sat for him two years after her break-up with Peter Townsend.

The portrait of Princess Margaret was historic, and presumably of considerably greater value than previously thought.

With his parents, Lord Snowdon and Princess Margaret, in 1964. Born in 1961, David spent much of his early life at Buckingham Palace where he was schooled alongside Prince Andrew

Then there is the Aston Martin DB5 convertible his father gave him. Lord Snowdon admired it so much when his friend, the late actor Peter Sellers, owned it that he persuaded him to sell it to him. Snowdon gave it to his son - who then sold it.

Linley sold 60 percent of his company to British yacht broker James Edmiston for a $6.5 million cash infusion (just under £5m) in 2010 and 40 percent was kept by Linley, who remained chairman throughout these changes.

Many are now wondering what will happen to his late father’s Kensington townhouse, where Linley’s Seventies Fiat 500 is often parked these days.

Bought for Snowdon by the Queen for £70,000 on his divorce and held in trust for his children, the property is now worth £10 million.

Last night a spokesman for David and Serena said: ‘The Earl and Countess of Snowdon have amicably agreed that their marriage has come to an end and that they shall be divorced. They ask that the press respect their privacy and that of their family.’",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8016005/Earl-Snowden-Countess-wifes-divorce.html

Charlie McEntee, 49, was detained at London Stansted Airport on Valentine's Day on suspicion of burglary following claims she stole £10,000 worth of timepieces.

The valuables were allegedly taken from the home of McEntee's millionaire accountant ex-boyfriend John Carey, 49, in Brentwood, Essex, last December.

Charlie McEntee, 49, hit the headlines in June 2002 for posing for photographers in a see-through dress at Ascot Racecourse, exposing her bare breasts and a pair of lace knickers

Mother-of-three McEntee, a former financial adviser, has been released on bail until Friday and denies wrongdoing, with her lawyer calling the claims 'deranged'.

McEntee hit the headlines in June 2002 for posing for photographers in a see-through dress at Ascot, exposing her bare breasts and a pair of lace knickers.

McEntee is thought to have been married at least five times, with Mr Carey telling The Sun how they met on Match.com while he was in the middle of a divorce.

They had sex in a hotel bed during their second meeting in December 2018, with Mr Carey describing her as a 'wildcat in bed, noisy, demanding and adventurous'.

They moved into a £300,000 four-bedroom villa in Murla, a village near Alicante in Spain, but split up after he received a letter containing allegations about her.

McEntee (pictured in 2002) bought her notorious Ascot dress for £1,100 from a designer boutique in Kensington, West London, and paired it with lacy knickers from Marks & Spencer

But her lawyer Ignacio Pellicer, from Pellicer & Heredia in Alicante, told the Sun: 'My client confirms that these are all lies and the police investigations will prove this.

'She says that the rantings of psychotic ex-partners and a jealous brother are exactly that - deranged rantings.'

An Essex Police spokesman told MailOnline: 'A 49-year-old woman was arrested at Stansted Airport on February 14, 2020 on suspicion of burglary in connection with a report regarding a burglary at a property in Brentwood on December 7, 2019.

'The woman has been released on police bail pending further enquiries until February 21, 2020.'

McEntee attracted the attention of photographers while attending Ascot in June 2002

Speaking about choosing the dress, she said in 2002: 'I went into the shop and she said, 'I've got the best dress in the world and it's suitable for Ascot, have a look'.

'And for once I didn't even try it on, I just took it, put it on on the day, got in my car and drove down.' She said she was astonished at the response to the dress.

'I'm known for my very extensive wardrobe and I do have some very dramatic outfits. But that's the greatest reaction I've ever had.'

The historic town in Shropshire was left holding its breath as the rising waters were due to peak overnight.

It was one of dozens of towns and villages menaced by the floods more than 48 hours after Storm Dennis battered Britain with torrential rain and winds of more than 90mph.

The historic town in Shropshire was left holding its breath as the rising waters were due to peak overnight

In Ironbridge, around 30 homes were evacuated yesterday and 21 parked cars towed to safe ground.

Tractors brought hundreds of sandbags in during the afternoon. The river is expected to reach around 22ft (6.7metres) with the abnormally high levels running for at least six hours overnight.

Police issued a plea to several residents who had chosen to stay in their properties to change their minds, warning them that they could be marooned.

The devastation caused by the storm could already be seen in the nearby village of Jackfield, where only the roof of the Boat Inn pub was visible after the Severn burst its banks there.

Last night it emerged that the storm has so far devastated up to 1,500 properties in the UK with rescue teams continuing to pull residents from inundated homes. Thousands more properties have been evacuated.

Authorities yesterday admitted being unprepared for the scale of the crisis, amid warnings that the country is in 'uncharted territory'.

More floods are looming as already ravaged parts of Britain face further rain on ground heavily saturated by Storm Dennis and by Storm Ciara the previous week. Dave Throup, an Environment Agency manager for Herefordshire and Worcestershire, said: 'We are not out of the woods yet.

'There is quite a long way to go with this flood.' Writing online, he added: 'This is not normal flooding, we are in uncharted territory.' Clive Wright, chief executive of Shropshire Council, said that the weather chaos was 'an unprecedented situation [that came] with no warning'.

He said: 'All of the modelling didn't predict the amount of water that would fall and particularly in certain locations.'

Last night, there were also worries for Bewdley in Worcestershire, where the Severn is expected to reach its highest levels in more than 20 years overnight.

A team of 25 firemen yesterday used boats to move dozens of residents, some in wheelchairs and suffering from dementia, from a care home in Whitchurch, Shropshire.

MPs yesterday questioned why Boris Johnson has chosen to remain holed up at the Government's Chevening grace and favour mansion in Kent while the crisis unfolds and asked why he had not called a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee to handle the official response.

Daniel Kawczynskie, Tory MP for Shrewsbury, said: 'Given the flooding crisis in our constituencies why has Commons not been recalled?' He said that more Government funding and flood defence schemes were needed in the Shropshire town, where flood waters blocked main roads yesterday.

Labour MP for Halifax, Holly Lynch, said: 'His refusal to call a Cobra meeting has really hampered the recovery of lots of different communities.'

'So what you're seeing is Meghan and Harry quit Britain, quit the Royals, they don't want to do it anymore, they want to go and speak to banks and be celebrities. That's fine. But they've got to leave the work, the duty, now for the other royals.

The panel, which included Sharon Osbourne, Marie Osmond, NeNe Leakes, Sheryl Underwood and Carrie Ann Inaba, listened as Piers explained how Prince Charles would become king.

'The queen mother was 101. The queen is 93. I suspect she will live until 100. And when she dies, it goes to Charles if he's still alive, obviously.

'The royal family believe that you have to keep it natural and the natural order.

Fastnet Lighthouse, off the coast of Cork in Ireland, is filmed being engulfed by giant waves

The short clip showed waves bashing the sides of the look-out tower as winds reached up to 91mph.

The tower, which sits on a high rock, seemed to sway from side to side, something Mary said could be to do with the camera's super zoom mode.

Another theory is that the lens of the camera itself was shuddering in the high winds - causing the image to appear to move.

Fastnet Lightnet was built 100 years ago, and became operational in 1904 after a cost of almost £90,000.

The tower was built using a dovetail technique, meaning each of the granite stones of the tower was dovetailed into those around it, bonding the structure.

When Mary Cadogen looks through the lens of her camera she notices the lighthouse seems to look unsteady

The building replaced an older lighthouse on the same site, and is in fact the third lighthouse to be constructed in the area, with the original Fastnet lighthouse replacing an earlier lighthouse on Cape Clear Island.

They said: 'Ken was born in Belfast in 1961. He moved to England when he was 18 and pursued a career in retail.

'He married in 2000 and has a wife Mandy and step daughter Laura. He was proud of Winchester, where he lived happily for 25 years.

'He was passionate about his family, dogs, football and chocolate and he will be sorely missed by everybody that knew and loved him.'

It comes as a man who died in a fall from a Scottish mountain in Storm Dennis has named by police as Richard Armstrong.

The 42-year-old, from Cumbria, plunged nearly 100ft from the path for 3278ft high Stob Ban on the south side of Glen Nevis in Lochaber on Sunday.

Police Scotland confirmed that he died as a result of the incident which reported shortly after 1pm as Storm Dennis raged.

Mr Armstrong was pronounced dead at the scene and his body was recovered in a six hour operation by the Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team.

Donald Paterson, deputy leader of Lochaber MRT, said Mr Armstrong was with a companion and guide - and were taking part in a winter hills training course.

He described the conditions as 'horrendous'.

'The winds were gusting over 50mph. I was knocked over twice. Some of my team were also knocked over too. There was snow, hail, wind and rain at lower levels. It was awful.

River levels remain high at the Worcester river gauge as a result of Storm Dennis. Consequently, flooding of property and roads is expected to continue

A Norman abbey built more than 900 years ago has become a beacon for rural communities struck by some of the worst floods in living memory.

The idyllic Tewkesbury Abbey has survived countless flooding disasters in the Gloucestershire market town - from where it takes its name - over the years.

As well as its close proximity to both the River Avon and River Severn, picturesque Tewkesbury also has watercourses such as the River Swilgate and the Tirle Brook running through it, making it a major flood risk.

Aerial photographs of the former Benedictine monastery marooned on what is now known locally as the Isle of Tewkesbury have become iconic reminders of some of the most significant floods of the past 20 years.

While the town has suffered repeatedly at the hands of burst riverbanks and heavy rainfall, Tewkesbury Abbey has stood strong throughout notorious storms such as the ones that blighted the county in 2007, 2012 and 2019.

In that time it has suffered very minor flood damage, and has once again avoided irreparable ruin this week following Storm Dennis, which has left hundreds of homes surrounding it submerged in water.

467,"Give vegans their own shelf in the fridge at work, bosses are told","['Amelia Clarke', 'Amelia Clarke For The Daily Mail']","Vegans have called on bosses for a shake-up in the workplace – including separate food areas in office kitchens.

The Vegan Society published new guidelines in a booklet after a judge's landmark ruling that ethical veganism is protected by law against workplace discrimination.

Vegans believe that animals should not be used for food, clothing or entertainment. There are around 600,000 Britons following the plant-based diet.

Vegans have called on bosses for a shake-up in the workplace – including separate food areas in office kitchens (Stock image)

The charity's suggestions include designated food storage areas for vegans, such as a shelf in the fridge above non-vegan foods.

The booklet tells companies: 'If you have a practice of providing only dairy milk in the kitchen, and you know a vegan has no choice but to bring in their own milk, now would be a good time to adjust this practice so that you are making provisions equally to your non-vegan and vegan employees.'

It recommends that staff have access to vegan-friendly uniform, such as synthetic boots or a non-leather phone case.

They should also be able to opt out of business events such as meals that revolve around animal products – like a 'hog roast' barbecue - or trips to horse races.

The guidelines state employers should consider 'exempting vegans from participating in buying (or signing off on the purchase of) non-vegan products'. The society said bosses can 'create a positive atmosphere' by monitoring whether an employee's ethical vegan stance is the subject of mockery.

It stressed: 'Fostering a general attitude of respect towards vegan employees is key. If 'jokes' made about an employee's veganism become burdensome, steps should be made to improve this. One way of assessing whether a co-worker has gone too far with comments to or about vegans is to consider what type of conversational behaviour would be deemed offensive to other individuals with protected characteristics, such as those who adhere to certain religious values.'

The court ruling last month said harassing ethical vegans at work is the same as abusing people on the basis of their race or sex. The judgment came after vegan Jordi Casamitjana, 55, alleged he was unfairly dismissed by the League Against Cruel Sports because of his deeply-held convictions.

Employment judge Robin Postle said: 'It is clearly a view that meets all the requirements of a philosophical belief.' He added the principles should be protected under the Equality Act 2010.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8018663/Give-vegans-shelf-fridge-work-bosses-told.html

If You Click On Them We May Earn A Small Commission. That Helps Us Fund This Is Money', 'Keep It Free To Use. We Do Not Write Articles To Promote Products. We Do Not Allow Any Commercial Relationship To Affect Our Editorial Independence.']","Within a green velvet box lies a pristine first edition of Animal Farm from 1945. Rare book dealer Pom Harrington gently removes its dust jacket to reveal George Orwell's signature.

'This is really collectible and rare. There are only three or four in the world that are signed,' he says. The price? £120,000.

I have come to the Peter Harrington bookshop in South Kensington, West London — founded in 1969 by Pom's father — to learn the secret to investing in books.

Paper money: Moneymail reporter Amelia Murray browses through some of the rare and expensive books at the Peter Harrington bookshop in South Kensington, West London

From the outside, the dark green exterior matches my image of what an old bookshop should look like.

But inside, instead of piles of dusty volumes, there are impossibly neat rows of books on shelves that reach the ceiling. Some copies are in glass cabinets.

Mr Harrington tells me that book investors tend to start as collectors, who buy a few titles they loved as children and then can't stop. They may then go on to sell these childhood books to fund more purchases.

As rare books are so pricey, it's not surprising that many collectors work in the financial services or entertainment industries.

For those starting out, the most important factors to consider are a book's condition, rarity and desirability. First editions are typically the most prized, as the first print run is often small.

For example, in 2017, an inscribed first edition of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone fetched £106,250 at a Bonhams auction.

There were only 500 first-edition hardback copies of the 1997 book printed, and this was one of the first supplied to Rowling by the publisher.

Last year, auction house Sotheby's sold another first edition of the book for £81,250 — well above its £20,000 to £30,000 estimate.

Dr Philip Errington, senior specialist at Sotheby's book department, says industry rumours helped push up the book's value, as it was unclear how many of the first editions would be made available to the public.

It was estimated that 300 were sent to libraries, making privately owned copies very rare.

Collectors are also often interested in the third book, Harry Potter And The Prisoner of Azkaban.

Rare editions of James Bond novels (pictured), Charles Dickens and Shakespeare are considered safe bets as they have been popular since they were first printed

The first 2,500 copies printed mistakenly included Joanne Rowling on the copyright page, instead of J. K. Rowling, and can go for thousands of pounds.

There is less interest in later books as the series became so popular that millions of books were printed in each run.

When it comes to the condition of a book, it should be clean, unmarked, unread and should have its dust jacket. Mr Harrington advises collectors to avoid books described as 'good for its age'.

For beginners, the later works of popular writers are cheaper. You can get first-edition Roald Dahl and Agatha Christie books for as little as £30 to £50.

The difficulty is predicting trends, as it can be hard to know what people will think about certain writers in 30 years.

For example, the value of Victorian illustrator Kate Greenaway's work has fallen in the last two decades, following years of being highly collectible.

However, rare editions of James Bond novels, Charles Dickens and Shakespeare are considered safe bets as they have been popular since they were first printed.

Mr Harrington says there was also a surge in interest in economics books after the 2008 financial crash.

A first edition of John Keynes's The General Theory Of Employment, Interest And Money from 1936 cost £3,000 12 years ago. It could now fetch £12,000.

Dr Errington adds that film franchises can often put books back into the spotlight. But if the film flops, it could damage the brand.

Prices of Philip Pullman's books increased in anticipation of the film release of The Golden Compass in 2007, but dropped after its poor reception.

Prices of Philip Pullman's books increased before the release of the Golden Compass film but dropped after its poor reception

Signatures or inscriptions can also add value, but beware of fakes, particularly when buying online.

Purchasing books from rare book fairs — such as the one in London's Battersea in June — or dealers, can also give you a better idea of their condition. Be sure to use reputable dealers, such as those accredited by trade body the Antiquarian Booksellers' Association (aba.org.uk/aba-members).

Unlike alternative investments, there is no public index that tracks rare book prices. Stamp dealer Stanley Gibbons launched one in 2015 but has since sold its book business.

American Book Prices Current tracks books sold at auction but costs $800 (£615) for non-experts to subscribe to for the first year.

Mr Harrington recommends buying rare copies of books you enjoy, as it is likely others will want these, too.

Laura Suter, personal finance analyst at investment platform AJ Bell, says: 'You need to be wary of tying up too much of your money, as the market is very uncertain.

'There won't be hordes of potential buyers out there and the rarest books can cost in the high six-figures. The last thing you want is to plough all your money into one rare book only to find there's no market for it, or it has a defect that devalues it.'

Books kept at home should be insured, and very valuable editions should be kept in secure storage, away from daylight and in a dry place.

Mr Harrington says: 'If you are buying books purely as an investment, you are more likely to get it wrong. In the old days you could double the value of a rare book every seven years — but I don't think you can say that now.'

469,At last! This is what we voted for: DAVID GOODHART on Priti Patel's post-Brexit immigration system,"['David Goodhart', 'David Goodhart For The Daily Mail']","The post-Brexit shake-up to Britain's immigration system, unveiled today by Priti Patel, should be welcomed on the grounds of politics, economics – and general fairness.

I would go further. This new, points-based labour migration policy represents the re-establishment of a national social contract with the British workforce – a contract that was ripped up when we adopted an open-door policy to EU migrants.

The Government's new system is much fairer because it works on merit, not nationality. We will no longer be forced to discriminate against a migrant from, say, New Zealand, over a Slovenian who enjoys an unambiguous right to come here.

The new approach is democratically appropriate, too. It was for this sort of policy that many voted in the Brexit referendum of 2016, a sentiment that also may have swept Boris Johnson to his landslide election victory.

The post-Brexit shake-up to Britain's immigration system, unveiled today by Priti Patel, should be welcomed on the grounds of politics, economics – and general fairness

After three years of parliamentary dithering, British voters now understand that the Government actually responds to popular instruction. We may therefore avoid the alarming spikes in support for the far-Right parties that are currently flourishing in many parts of the EU.

Quite simply, the current immigration system has not been working – either for the country or the workforce. With only a few honourable exceptions, Britain's large employers have got away with murder over two decades.

With a huge pool of cheap EU labour now denied them, many will have to invest a bit more, train workers a bit more and even pay them a bit more.

And what's wrong with that?

Spending on workforce-training in Britain has fallen by 20 per cent since 2004, when we opened the doors to mass migration from the EU.

For almost two decades, the UK's employers have reflexively turned to well-trained and generally reliable Eastern European labour, avoiding the bother of training and inspiring British youngsters, many of whom – it has to be said – are more disposed to stay in bed than their European counterparts.

The new approach is democratically appropriate, too. It was for this sort of policy that many voted in the Brexit referendum of 2016, a sentiment that also may have swept Boris Johnson to his landslide election victory

Not only are big companies guilty of this – the professional middle classes have followed suit, employing Czechs and Poles as nannies and builders rather than selecting candidates from closer to home.

There is nothing disgraceful in doing so, of course. But it has come at a high price. Large employers have avoided investing in expensive technologies while a seemingly limitless pool of cheap EU labour has kept the economic show on the road.

This is one reason why Britain's productivity levels are so dismally low, and falling further. Countries with lower productivity than their competitors are doomed to become ever poorer.

It is true that – as Government ministers rarely tire of saying – Britain enjoys effective full employment. But this rosy picture conceals problems, particularly at the low-skilled and younger end of the workforce.

Our youth unemployment level is 11.7 per cent, lower than in Spain and in Italy, but higher than in Germany, which has a stellar record of bringing the young into the workforce with outstanding apprentice schemes.

In the 16-to-24 age group in the UK, there are 800,000 so-called 'Neets', young people who are not in any form of education, employment or training – a truly sobering figure.

At that level, a range of workers in different industries will be able to come to Britain, provided they can earn further points for speaking English and have a job offer from a reputable employer

If Mr Johnson is to re-establish this crucial social contract with the labour force, he must speedily address this issue, offering incentives to British workers and employers.

Even though the EU's share of Britain's total workforce is a relatively modest 7 per cent nationally, it is fully 17 per cent in London. And the national figures disguise some areas of genuine concern. Certain sectors have become alarmingly dependent on EU labour – a third of workers in food manufacturing and a fifth in the hotel trade.

Little wonder, therefore, that big business has generally been so scathing about any measure to reduce its access to a vast pool of EU labour. Many scare stories have been spread about the potential impact of restricting EU labour, but middle- and higher-skilled workers will still be welcome in a new light-touch regime.

It is the employers of low-skilled foreign labour that will feel the pinch –and so they should.

For all that, it was sensible of the Government to follow advice from the Migration Advisory Committee and reduce the immigration salary threshold for skilled workers from £30,000 to £25,600.

If Mr Johnson is to re-establish this crucial social contract with the labour force, he must speedily address this issue, offering incentives to British workers and employers

At that level, a range of workers in different industries will be able to come to Britain, provided they can earn further points for speaking English and have a job offer from a reputable employer. Needless to say, it will still be important to keep a sharp eye on labour shortages, and ease the rules if industries begin to suffer.

But some of the objections are alarmist. For instance, only 4 per cent of nurses are from the EU, and the figure is roughly double that in the care services.

These are substantial numbers, of course, but over time such figures can be managed.

Meanwhile, the Labour Party has become effectively the party of uncontrolled mass immigration, in defiance of the beliefs of its former core voters.

Opinion polling over many years has shown that most people want proper control of our borders, which is hardly a radical demand.

It is true that immigration has dropped down the list of voters' priorities, but that is because of a general sense that the Government is preparing to take action to control it, especially since the Brexit referendum.

Diane Abbott, the Shadow Home Secretary, has already dismissed the Government's new policy by saying it is a meaningless soundbite and 'isn't an Australian points-based system'.

She's dead wrong in her first point: this is genuine reform, not sloganeering. But Miss Abbott is right in her second point.

This was never intended to be a copy of Australia's system.

The immigration policy Down Under is predicated on filling a vast, under-populated country.

Britain's policy, operating in an overcrowded island off the coast of an even more populous continent, is designed specifically to restore the contract with working people, to raise productivity and reduce the shaming number of economically inactive youths here.

By those measures it shall be judged, and my firm belief is that in time it will come to be seen as a great advance.

470,"The chances of having a child of either sex is genuinely random, scientists find","['Ian Randall', 'Ian Randall For Mailonline']","The tendency to have boys or girls does not run in the family and the chances of having a child of either sex is genuinely random, scientists have found.

Researchers studied the sex of people born in Sweden over the last 90 years to determine whether or not people are more likely to have children of a given sex.

Their findings shake up key theories over sex ratios used by biologists, who often assumed that the ratio of boys to girls in one's offspring was a heritable trait.

Scroll down for video

Pictured: in the Brady Bunch, a lovely lady with three very lovely girls met a man with three boys of his own. In real life, however, the tendency to have boys or girls does not run in the family and the chances of having a child of a given sex is random, scientists report

The ratio of boys to girls among one's children — which researchers refer to as the 'offspring sex ratio' — is known to be around one-to-one.

Experts explain this in terms of the so-called Fisher's principle, which says that — in a population with an uneven ratio of men to women — individuals of the rarer sex will be more valuable from a reproductive perspective.

Accordingly, the theory goes, individuals who are genetically disposed to have more offspring of the rarer sex will be more successful, so more children of the rarer sex will be born until the population ratio evens out.

Fisher's principle relies, however, on offspring sex ratio being a heritable property that can be passed down the generations — but this has not been proven.

In their study, Dr Zietsch and colleagues analysed the entire population of people born in Sweden from 1932 to the present day.

This included 3,543,243 individuals and their 4,753,269 children.

The team looked to see whether there was any association between the sex of an individual's offspring and the sex of their siblings' offspring.

The researchers found that the ratio of boys to girls a person has is not an inherent property that passes down through the generations. Instead, the sex of one's children is essentially random, although with slightly more male children born in general

That officers let the protest continue undisrupted without making arrests was described as ‘an affront not only to the law-abiding public but to democracy itself’.

The damaged lawn, outside Trinity College, surrounds an apple tree said to be descended from the one that inspired Sir Isaac Newton’s discovery of gravity.

Tory MP Anthony Browne said he was ‘horrified’ by police inaction, adding: ‘The role of the police is to uphold the law.’

No arrests were made on the day of the protest, although police later accepted that ‘a crime has been recorded for criminal damage’.

Yesterday, as protests by activists Extinction Rebellion continued across the city, two women – an artist and her former flatmate – were led away by police.

Caitlin Fay, 19, was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. She was also arrested during the group’s protests in London in October, when she wrote on social media: ‘Many people say our actions are inconvenient.

Boris Johnson has called us “uncooperative crusties”. We are doing this for everyone, the planet, the children, the animals.’ Freelance animator Gabriella Ditton, 26, was arrested for allegedly spraying graffiti. Police could not say whether there had been other arrests.

Extinction Rebellion, whose street protests last year shut down large swathes of London, are targeting the university over its investments in fossil fuels and plans to turn a Suffolk farm into a business park. They threaten to continue their disruption all week.

Mr Browne, MP for South Cambridgeshire, was among those to criticise Cambridgeshire Constabulary for failing to curb the chaos and halt the criminal damage.

‘I am horrified at Extinction Rebellion causing criminal damage to the Trinity College lawn and illegally blockading the roads,’ he said. ‘I also find it concerning that the police have taken the stance they have – I understand the difficult position they are in, but the role of the police is to uphold the law and they should do so.’

In a letter to the force’s acting Police and Crime Commissioner Ray Bisby, he added: ‘Extinction Rebellion are flagrantly breaking the law, yet so far Cambridgeshire Constabulary has taken no action to intervene.

‘I am aware of the need to balance the rights of peaceful protest with the rights of individuals to go about their lawful business, but in this case it is the overwhelming response of the public that the police have got the balance wrong.

‘This type of protest is an affront not only to the law-abiding public, but to democracy itself.’ By causing criminal damage to the university turf, the activists were undermining their own cause, he said.

Superintendent James Sutherland defended the force’s response to the damage – and roadblocks set up by protesters which resulted in ambulances being diverted.

‘The law requires us to protect people’s right to peaceful assembly,’ he said, citing the 1988 Human Rights Act. ‘Simply a road being blocked does not make a protest itself unlawful.’

Trinity College said it ‘regrets the criminal damage done to its property beside Great Gate’, adding: ‘The college respects the right to freedom of speech and non-violent protest but draws the line at criminal damage. Academics at Trinity are actively engaged in research to understand and develop solutions to climate change.’",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8018001/Police-fire-failing-stop-Extinction-Rebellion-activists-ripping-Cambridge-lawn.html#comments
472,"DOMINIC SANDBROOK: If police grovel when eco vandals tear up historic lawn, why have faith in them?","['Dominic Sandbrook', 'Dominic Sandbrook For The Daily Mail']","As millions of us know, no relationship is more heartfelt than that between an Englishman and his lawn.

‘Nothing is more pleasant to the eye,’ wrote Francis Bacon in 1625, ‘than green grass kept finely shorn.’ A well-kept garden, Bacon explained, was the ‘greatest refreshment to the spirit of man’ that could possibly be imagined.

Ever since, the English have been renowned for their love of a carefully tended lawn. That little square of grass has embodied order and moderation, the supreme symbol of Middle England.

So perhaps it is no wonder that of all Extinction Rebellion’s juvenile, posturing stunts, the wanton vandalism of the lawn at Trinity College, Cambridge has struck a national chord.

The police (pictured during the protest at Trinity College, Cambridge) were too craven to intervene because senior figures were frightened to stand against a ‘progressive’ cause, writes Dominic Sandbrook

In case you missed it, the Cambridge branch of the extreme eco-warriors took great offence at Trinity’s decision to sell farmland near the Port of Felixstowe, which developers want to turn into an industrial estate.

To punish the college, the anarchists invaded Trinity’s lawn, ripped it up, carted the mud off to a Barclays Bank branch, and chained themselves to an apple tree, waving the usual flags and chanting the traditional inane slogans.

They claimed this was an ideal way to protest against the ‘destruction of nature’. Where do you start with such grotesque stupidity?

Are Cambridge colleges not allowed to sell their own property? Should all industrial estates be shut down, despite the local economic damage?

Is tearing up a lawn the best way to defend nature? Isn’t it simply a childish act of self-aggrandising vandalism, for which the perpetrators should face the full force of the law?

For me, the astounding thing is Extinction Rebellion (XR) seriously believe such antics advance their cause. In reality, like their attempts to block highways, and airports, stunts such as the Cambridge Lawn Massacre simply turn ordinary people against them.

To punish the college, the anarchists invaded Trinity’s lawn, ripped it up, carted the mud off to a Barclays Bank branch, and chained themselves to an apple tree, waving the usual flags and chanting the traditional inane slogans

One poll for the Cambridge Evening News’s website found a staggering 94 per cent of local readers thought the protest was ‘nothing more than vandalism’.

So much for raising environmental awareness.

And as so often when virtue-signalling brats decide to lecture us all about their consciences, it is hard to miss the stench of hypocrisy.

When XR’s spokeswoman Sarah Lunnon went on the radio to defend them, she reportedly travelled to the studio by car.

Of course she did. But shouldn’t she have walked, or taken a bike? Shouldn’t her comrades go round and tear up her lawn, too?

And as on previous occasions, the protesters seemed not to care that they were putting public services at risk.

Contrary to their dishonest claims, at least one ambulance was forced to turn around when faced with XR’s roadblocks, and there have been accounts of other ambulances making long detours.

The real question... is not why XR are so stupid. It is: What on earth were Cambridgeshire Police doing? (pictured is the damaged lawn after the protest this week)

We have seen plenty of antics like these before, from the radicals of the 1960s to the Greenham Common women in the 1980s. Self-appointed activists and posturing protesters will always be with us. Every generation has them.

The real question, therefore, is not why XR are so stupid. It is: What on earth were Cambridgeshire Police doing?

After all, they had plenty of opportunities to stop the vandals. So why did the police stand idly by? And, most unforgivably, why did these latter-day Dixons of Dock Green actually make the protesters’ task easier by putting up roadblocks to deter the traffic? At first, police spokesmen claimed they could not intervene because the Human Rights Act guarantees the right to peaceful protest. Surprise, surprise!

But this is nonsense. Since the law forbids people from obstructing the highway and damaging private property, the constabulary would have been perfectly entitled to step in.

Indeed, in a video released on Monday, Cambridgeshire Police’s Superintendent James Sutherland admitted that the issue was not ‘black and white’. The police could have intervened if they thought the protest threatened public order, Superintendent Sutherland said. But ‘it’s a peaceful protest, there’s no disorder’.

The police’s job is not to promote diversity, encourage inclusion, stimulate eco-awareness or any other of the lazy, second-hand phrases that pass for political discourse among the slow and simple-minded. Their job is to uphold the law and arrest wrongdoers (protesters are seen on the Cambridge lawn)

As any sane observer can see, though, this was simply not true. Is vandalising private property not disorder? Is invading a High Street bank not disorder?

Just imagine that, for your own peculiar political reasons, you took against your next-door neighbour, ripped up his lawn and hauled it off to the nearest branch of Barclays. Would the police stand by and do nothing?

Would they defend your human right to smash up his garden? Would they reroute the traffic to make your life a little bit easier?

Of course they wouldn’t. And here’s another experiment.

Just imagine the protesters in Cambridge weren’t spoiled, entitled middle-class brats, but kids from a council estate. Would the police have let them get away with it? We all know the answer. No, of course not.

The police were too craven to intervene because senior figures were frightened to stand against a ‘progressive’ cause. So desperate to appear ‘woke’, they lacked the guts to enforce the law.

And this reflects a wider picture. Like so many public institutions, from our universities to the BBC, the police force has been contaminated with a lazy, uncritical, knee-jerk political correctness.

Question the fashionable transgender dogma of the day on Twitter and you can expect a visit from the local constabulary. Poke fun at the holiness of ‘diversity’, and you might be facing a night in the cells.

But rip up your neighbours’ lawn? If it’s for environmental awareness, then fair enough.

In itself, I know, this might seem a trivial episode. (Although it’s not so trivial, of course, to the college gardeners whose work has been destroyed by these entitled morons, or to the patients whose ambulances have been blocked en route to hospital.)

But it is a perfect example of the growing schism between the vast majority of ordinary Britons, who recognise cant, dishonesty and vandalism when they see them, and the people who run our public institutions, whose instinct is always to grovel and appease.

You see examples in almost every walk of life, from university officials taking down ‘problematic’ statues of anyone associated with the Empire to museum curators wanting rid of their own collections.

Until now, I thought the worst case was the cowardice of the Royal Shakespeare Company, scrapping a sponsorship deal with BP, subsidising tickets for teenagers, after criticism from a handful of self-righteous students who objected to the association with fossil fuels.

But this latest episode is the most disturbing. For if there’s one institution that cannot fall victim to the cult of hectoring ‘wokeness’, it’s the police.

The police’s job is not to promote diversity, encourage inclusion, stimulate eco-awareness or any other of the lazy, second-hand phrases that pass for political discourse among the slow and simple-minded. Their job is to uphold the law and arrest wrongdoers.

Judged by these standards, Cambridgeshire Police have demonstrably failed. And not only have they let local people down, they are at serious risk of forfeiting public confidence.

For if, faced with vandalism and disorder, the police’s instinct is to grovel in the gutter, then why should we trust them to keep us safe? Why have any faith in them at all?

No wonder, then, in Cambridge there is now talk of a ‘counter-protest’ against the XR extremists. For if you can’t trust the police, why wouldn’t you take the law into your own hands?

That way, of course, lies anarchy. So the local constabulary simply must get a grip.

Clean up the disorder. Arrest the vandals. Let ordinary residents get on with their lives, and have some respect for people’s lawns. It’s really not that complicated, is it?",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/columnists/article-8018315/DOMINIC-SANDBROOK-police-grovel-eco-vandals-tear-historic-lawn-faith-them.html
473,Every child in the world is under threat as decades of health improvements begin to stall,"['Ben Spencer', 'Ben Spencer Medical Correspondent For The Daily Mail']","Every child in the world is under threat as decades of health improvements begin to stall, according to major World Health Organisation report.

Obesity, air pollution and climate change pose an 'immediate threat' to children in wealthy and poor countries alike.

The report, written by 40 experts from around the world and published in the Lancet, said no country of the 180 analysed are protecting child's health adequately on all measures.

They said big business is to blame by using 'exploitative marketing practices' to 'push heavily processed fast food, sugary drinks, alcohol and tobacco at children'.

The UK gives children good start in life - among the best ten countries in the world for 'flourishing' child health thanks to the strong NHS and education system.

But it trails in 133rd place on providing a healthy environment - with Britain on track to emit 115 per cent more carbon dioxide by 2030 than its emissions target.

Experts are also concerned about Britain's faltering vaccination uptake, with childhood immunisation now standing at 94 per cent - lower than most other European countries.

Widespread childhood poverty in the UK is also putting children at risk.

Every child in the world is under threat as decades of health improvements begin to stall, according to major World Health Organisation report

Professor Anthony Costello of University College London, who contributed to the report, said: 'While the UK's wealth, provision of free health care through the NHS, and investment in pre-school education and social welfare are strongly linked to good child survive and thrive measures, we cannot rest on our laurels.

'The widely respected Institute for Fiscal Studies predicts a seven per cent rise in child poverty between 2015 and 2022, and various sources predict child poverty rates of as high as 40 per cent.

'For almost one in every two children to be poor in 21st-century Britain is not just a disgrace, but a social calamity and an economic disaster, all rolled into one.'

Globally, the authors are most concerned about environmental issues and obesity.

They believe 'predatory marketing' of junk food and sugary drinks is directly driving obesity - the number of obese children and adolescents globally having increased from 11million in 1975 to 124million in 2016.

Professor Costello said: 'Industry self-regulation has failed.

'Studies in Australia, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and the USA - among many others - have shown that self-regulation has not hampered commercial ability to advertise to children.'

Children in Norway (pictured) have the best chance at survival and well-being

Helen Clark, former Prime Minister of New Zealand, who co-chaired the report, said: 'Despite improvements in child and adolescent health over the past 20 years, progress has stalled, and is set to reverse.

'Every child worldwide now faces existential threats from climate change and commercial pressures.

OBESITY IS SHORTENING LIVES GLOBALLY Soaring deaths caused by obesity will slash the average life expectancy of an American by nearly four years over the next three decades, a damning report revealed in October 2019. For Britons, the average life will be shortened by nearly three years over the same time frame thanks to a host of health issues linked to a bulging waistline, such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) made the bleak projections in a damning report about the global obesity epidemic, that ranks 36 developed countries and how they are tackling their citizens weight problems. It said that between 2020 and 2050, obesity and related illnesses will cause an average life expectancy drop of three years in the 36 countries it represents. A predicted 90million lives will be lost to illnesses related to overeating in the next 30 years. The average American lives to the age of 79, while the life expectancy in Britain is slightly higher, at 81. Almost 70 per cent of Americans and 62 per cent of adults in the UK are overweight or obese, putting them at risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, strokes and cancer.

'Countries need to overhaul their approach to child and adolescent health, to ensure that we not only look after our children today but protect the world they will inherit in the future.'

Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organisation, said: 'This report shows that the world's decision makers are failing today's children and youth - failing to protect their health, failing to protect their rights, and failing to protect their planet.

'This must be a wakeup call for countries to invest in child health and development, ensure their voices are heard, protect their rights, and build a future that is fit for children.'

The index shows compared performance on child flourishing, including measures of child survival, well-being and sustainability, including a proxy for greenhouse gas emissions.

Children in Norway, the Republic of Korea, and the Netherlands have the best chance at survival and well-being, while children in Central African Republic, Chad, Somalia, Niger and Mali face the worst odds.

However, when authors took per capita CO2 emissions into account, the top countries trail behind: Norway ranked 156, the Republic of Korea 166, and the Netherlands 160.

The United States of America (USA), Australia, and Saudi Arabia are among the ten worst emitters.

The only countries on track to beat CO2 emission per capita targets by 2030, while also performing fairly on child flourishing measures, were Albania, Armenia, Grenada, Jordan, Moldova, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, Uruguay and Vietnam.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8017367/Every-child-world-threat-decades-health-improvements-begin-stall.html
474,"We've only got 10 years to save the planet, warns Prince Charles","['Colin Fernandez Environment Correspondent', 'Colin Fernandez Environment Correspondent For The Daily Mail']","The Prince of Wales has issued a stark warning that humans have just ten years left to save the planet.

'We really do have to pull our fingers out now because the theory is we have got this decade left,' he declared.

Prince Charles was marking the 50th anniversary of a landmark speech he made on the environment by calling for nature to be put back at the centre of modern life.

In 1970, he had warned about the problems of plastic waste, chemicals being discharged into rivers and air pollution caused by factories, cars and planes. This was regarded as 'completely potty', said the Prince.

The Prince of Wales delivers a speech during a visit to officially open the National Automotive Innovation Centre (NAIC) in Coventry on Tuesday

There was also derision for his practical solutions, like a bottle bank at Buckingham Palace or installing a reed-bed sewage treatment system at his Highgrove home in Gloucestershire.

Speaking in an interview on the Sustainable Markets website, the Prince said: 'Everything we are doing has been to destroy our own means of survival, let alone the survival of everything else we depend on.

'But at the same time, we seem to be unable to understand that there is an alternative way of doing it, which is to put nature back at the centre, value everything she does and build from there, and now there is an amazing amount that can be done through the circular bio-economy.'

Since his speech on February 19, 1970, to the Countryside Steering Committee for Wales, Charles has worked to develop solutions to climate change and highlighted issues like overfishing and the threat to the world's rainforests.

He recently launched his latest project, the Sustainable Markets Initiative and Council, supported by the World Economic Forum.

The initiative aims to bring together leading individuals from the public and private sectors, charitable bodies and investors to identify ways to rapidly decarbonise the global economy.

The Prince added that scientists and evidence indicate that people are causing a 'much more rapid rise in temperature and a much more rapid destruction of the Arctic and now the Antarctic'.

Since his speech on February 19, 1970, to the Countryside Steering Committee for Wales, Charles has worked to develop solutions to climate change and highlighted issues like overfishing and the threat to the world's rainforests

He said: 'It is a question of trying to put the fire out very quickly and the real issue is how do we rapidly decarbonise?'

He also told how, as a teenager in the 1960s, he was concerned about the destruction of trees, wetlands and habitats as well as 'the white heat of progress and technology to the exclusion of nature and our surroundings'.

In his 1970 address, Charles highlighted a problem that has become an illustration of humanity's threat to nature.

Then he had said: 'When you think that each person produces roughly 2lb of rubbish per day and there are 55 million of us on this island using non-returnable bottles and indestructible plastic containers, it is not difficult to imagine the mountains of refuse that we shall have to deal with somehow.'

Of his warnings 50 years ago, he said: 'I was considered rather dotty, to say the least, for even suggesting these things, rather like when I set up a reed-bed sewage treatment system at Highgrove – that was considered completely mad. Everything I suggested was completely potty, apparently.'

475,SEBASTIAN SHAKESPEARE: Jilly Cooper's Riders hero set to marry again at 81,"['Sebastian Shakespeare', 'Sebastian Shakespeare For The Daily Mail']","Five-and-a-half years after the tragic death of his wife, Candida — daughter of national treasure and Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman — Rupert Lycett Green has been blessed with unexpected happiness.

At the age of 81, he is, I can disclose, about to marry again.

His bride is Julia Dawson, some 25 years his junior, who has two children by a previous marriage and lives close to Rupert and Candida’s old home in South Oxfordshire, where Rupert still lives.

‘It’s wonderful,’ a family friend tells me. ‘It would certainly have Candida’s blessing.’

Rupert Lycett Green, 81, is set to marry Julia Dawson five-and-a-half years after the tragic death of his wife Candida (he is pictured left with author Jilly Cooper, The Earl of Suffolk and Berkshire and Andrew Parker Bowles in 2016)

Lycett Green, who is said to have partly inspired Jilly Cooper’s fictional hero Rupert Campbell-Black in her bonkbuster novel Riders, refrains from commenting.

But no one is more delighted for him than one of his oldest friends, interior designer Nicky Haslam, who has known him since their schooldays together at Eton.

‘I am absolutely thrilled for him,’ he tells me. ‘Just goes to show that all the sport he has played for years has done wonders for him.

‘We’re glad he’s found someone as sparkling as Candida. Julia is very popular — all the neighbours love her. I haven’t met her yet but hope to next week as Rupert has invited me down for drinks.’

Mr Lycett Green married Candida Betjeman on 25th May 1963 in Wantage, Berkshire. She died in 2014 aged 71 after a 15-year battle with cancer

Candida, a close chum of the Prince of Wales and the Beatles, and Rupert, whom she married in 1963, were at the throbbing heart of Sixties London.

David Hockney painted her portrait and Ossie Clark designed her dresses, while Rupert founded Blades, the most fashionable gentlemen’s outfitters of its day. Candida’s biggest regret, she said, was ‘not going the whole hog with Mick Jagger’.

In homage to her wit, the couple, who went on to have a large and lively family of two daughters and three sons, became known as ‘Tailor and Cutter’.

Candida succumbed to cancer aged 71 after a 15-year battle, but not before sending a valedictory tweet to friends, urging them to sponsor her daughter, Imogen, and grandson, Ivo, on a bike ride to raise money for Pancreatic Cancer Action.

The Marquess of Bristol,aka Freddie, 40, and his American art consultant wife Meredith, 37, (pictured at their wedding in 2018) are expecting their first child next month

Love is in the heir for Lord Bristol

The Marquess of Bristol, scion of one of Britain’s most colourful aristocratic families, has secured his family dynasty and the possible future of his title.

For I can reveal that his wife, American art consultant Meredith Dunn, 37, is expecting their first child next month — two years after their wedding at Brompton Oratory.

‘They’re really looking forward to becoming parents. They’re so happy,’ Lord Bristol’s sister, Lady Victoria, tells me. Due to the law of primogeniture, the baby will inherit the family title only if it’s a boy. But it all hangs in the balance, as the prospective parents don’t know the gender yet.

Lord Bristol, aka Freddie, 40, inherited the title in 1999 from his half-brother, John, who squandered £30 million on drugs and died aged 44.

The 19-year-old Burberry Beauty campaign star, whose godmother is Kate Moss, says of her sartorial choices: ‘I use my clothes to project how I want to feel that day. My parents were eccentric and free. I like to channel that feeling.’

Beside her, 18-year-old Kaia, daughter of supermodel Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber, looked positively demure in a £671 Alexander Wang black minidress.

Chrysalis record company mogul Chris Wright, a Caribbean regular, is ‘staggered’ that Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds were able to stay in a Mustique villa for £15,000 over New Year. ‘Close to £50,000 would be a more accurate price,’ he says. Well done, Boris’s pals, on getting a bargain.

Sir Derek Jacobi says his reputation as ‘a sort of classical, posh, well-spoken, Shakespearean actor’ is misleading. ‘I’m a grown East London boy and I’m as common as muck,’ he says.

Comic Ben Elton takes issue with the idea we are living in an era of peak TV. ‘We’re calling it the Golden Age of Television, but I’m not sure. The one area that I feel is under-respected is the studio sitcom with a live audience,’ he told me at the opening night of his play Upstart Crow at the Gielgud Theatre.

‘I’ve always worked with the style of Dad’s Army, Blackadder and Only Fools And Horses, which were made with a live audience. The laughter was not recorded, it was real laughs and now it feels television isn’t as funny without it.’

Imelda's marriage secret

Imelda Staunton says the secret behind her 37-year marriage to fellow actor Jim Carter is that they haven’t spent too much time apart from one another.

‘I think the most time we’ve spent away is five weeks,’ she tells me, ‘because if you’re lucky enough to work, and work away, you have to make decisions — do you want to be married or give more to the world? We decided we would like to be married.’

Staunton, 64, who will play the Queen in the fifth series of The Crown, is happy that roles for older actresses have improved.

‘I do think things have got better for older actresses because, since we’ve had Judi [Dench] and Maggie [Smith], parts in general have got better for older women and men.’

476,ALAN RUSBRIDGER: The BBC's flawed. But abolishing the licence fee will only make Britain divided,"['Alan Rusbridger', 'Alan Rusbridger For The Daily Mail']","In October 1982 a Conservative politician called John Nott stormed out of a BBC interview with a journalist called Robin Day.

Nott was at the time Defence Secretary, while Day was a then-celebrated BBC interrogator.

The cause of the upset was the combative Day demanding of the unworldly Nott: 'Why should the public... believe you, a transient, here-today and, if I may say so, gone-tomorrow politician...'

He didn't get much further with the question before a furious Nott tore off his microphone and stomped out of the studio.

The BBC itself sailed magnificently on: bigger than both its own stars and the — yes, transient — politicians on whom it reported. Pictured: Broadcasting House

Nearly 40 years later, few people under the age of 60 will remember much about Nott.

He called his 2002 autobiography Here Today, Gone Tomorrow in dry acknowledgement of his 'five minutes of fame before... my descent into obscurity'.

Day, who presented Question Time for ten years, will be more widely remembered. But he, too, will one day fade from our collective memories.

But the BBC itself sailed magnificently on: bigger than both its own stars and the — yes, transient — politicians on whom it reported.

At the time, the walk-out made huge headlines — the latest in a series of bust-ups between the then Conservative government and the Corporation. But grown-up politicians and BBC chiefs knew the score.

A later chair of the BBC, Marmaduke Hussey, shrugged away such squalls: 'The BBC will always have an antagonistic relationship with the government of the day — that is in the nature of its independence.'

But all that has changed. Within weeks of being told that the Johnson Government intends to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee — thereby (in the worst fears of BBC supporters) making it a voluntary payment — we were told that the licence fee itself would be abolished.

There was some rowing back on that incendiary revelation this week when it was suggested that Boris Johnson and his consigliere Dominic Cummings are at odds on the issue

'We will whack it,' was the mob-style threat attributed to a senior Government source. I think we can all guess who.

There was some rowing back on that incendiary revelation this week when it was suggested that Boris Johnson and his consigliere Dominic Cummings are at odds on the issue but, if such a bold step were to be taken, it would spell the end of the BBC as we know it.

Until recently, the BBC's affable director-general, Tony Hall, imagined that he would retire in 2022 after celebrating 100 years of Auntie broadcasting to the nation and the wider world.

But in the space of barely a month all that has changed. Not only will Hall be gone long before 2022, it's not clear that there will be much to celebrate by then — or even if the BBC itself will survive.

How did it come to this? Boris Johnson is — sorry, Boris — just one more transient politician. Cummings will one day be an expanded footnote in British history.

So how come these two here-today-gone-tomorrow figures are in with a good chance of wrecking an institution which, like the Royal Family and the NHS, is loved and admired around the world?

Until recently, the BBC's affable director-general, Tony Hall (pictured), imagined that he would retire in 2022 after celebrating 100 years of Auntie broadcasting to the nation and the wider world

We should concede that lots of people are currently very cross with the BBC. Given three polarised years of Brexit-fulled anger it's hardly surprising that both sides ended up blaming the messenger.

Remainers will go to their graves cursing the Brexit Broadcasting Corporation. Leavers will forever believe the BBC is run by out-of-touch metropolitan elite pinkoes.

This is not the place to arbitrate between these two camps. But the bitterness on both sides will — let's hope — soon pass and we will tune in to a much more urgent problem which society is belatedly waking up to: no one knows what to believe any more.

That's a slight exaggeration. Two-thirds of us, according to a recent poll, can no longer distinguish between a good source of information and a dodgy one.

The crisis over fake news is one of the biggest threats to democratic societies — bigger, on some views, than terrorism. If citizens can no longer distinguish between fact and fiction, they become easy meat for populist politicians who can play on their ignorance.

Donald Trump is a genius at speaking directly to the 72 million who follow him on Twitter. A team at the Washington Post calculates that, since becoming President, he has made more than 16,000 false or misleading statements.

Donald Trump is a genius at speaking directly to the 72 million who follow him on Twitter

But who cares what real journalists find? Trump has made it his business to discredit and delegitimise the work of decent reporters. His brand of politics — like Russia's Vladimir Putin and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan — depends on creating a fog of uncertainty in which his facts are as good as anyone else's.

America has no BBC, or anything like it. Its citizens make do, for their information, with dying newspapers, opinionated talk radio, a swamp of social media and the shrill partisanship of channels such as Fox News. Into that cacophony steps the master manipulator of truth.

Whatever the current failings of BBC journalism, it is at least some kind of universally available tent peg in the ground. It does not always succeed in being impartial or fair to all sides.

Indeed, it makes its fair share of clumsy mistakes.

There was that over-enthusiastic tweet from its political editor Laura Kuenssberg claiming that one of Health Secretary Matt Hancock's advisers had been punched in the face by a Labour activist, something that turned out to be untrue.

And newsreader Huw Edwards liked a tweeted video that said 'Vote Labour for the National Health Service', a lapse he excused on the basis that he hadn't watched the clip right to the end.

Matters were not helped by the fact that both incidents occurred during a highly charged General Election campaign.

But the BBC behaves — by and large — extremely ethically and responsibly. It is to my eyes — as someone who edited a national newspaper for more than 20 years — as good a news organisation as any on the planet.

It is out there reporting on the world, as well as spread out across our nation in a way that no other news organisation could even dream of.

It is accountable and transparent in the way that few newspapers are: see the furore and multi-million pound inquiries that can follow on from mistakes that would pass unnoticed in Fleet Street.

But the BBC behaves — by and large — extremely ethically and responsibly. It is to my eyes — as someone who edited a national newspaper for more than 20 years — as good a news organisation as any on the planet (stock photo)

It funds 150 reporters to sit in courts and councils to be watchdogs on our behalf.

That doesn't make it perfect. We all have our gripes. I wish for it to be braver in its investigative journalism. I, too, shout at the Today programme and cringe at Question Time.

But the appropriate response to under-performance is reform. The NHS has badly performing hospitals, the strain of severe winters and crises over rogue consultants. The answer is constant improvement, not abolition.

Some say the BBC is doomed long term because millennials are not only switching to streaming services, such as Netflix and HBO, but also increasingly failing to pay the licence fee.

There is some truth in this, but there is nothing to stop us following the example of Norway, which is in the process of phasing out its licence fee model in favour of one based on a general public service tax.

To those who argue that we should get rid of the licence fee and turn the BBC into a privatised subscription service for people who want to pay to be informed, I say prepare to watch a decline in trust and an inevitable parallel rise in information inequality.

Such an approach is not technically feasible in any case. As Culture minister John Whittingdale (a former Culture Secretary) has pointed out, Freeview — Britain's largest television platform — is incapable of switching off certain stations for non-subscribers.

Scrapping Freeview and putting all BBC channels online is not an option either, as a large number of viewers do not have access to broadband or are unwilling to pay for it.

The inescapable truth is that without a public-sector broadcaster, we will — like America — see the growth of a gap between an informed elite and the rest. We'll lose the glue that binds us and become more polarised and doubtful about whom to believe.

You don't have to imagine the informational chaos that will follow: it's happening in too many countries around the world right now.

So don't allow two transient figures to dismember the BBC. If Brexit was about anything, it was about taking back control — including our own narrative. It's our BBC, not theirs.

477,You heard it here first... I'm deaf: JENNI MURRAY refused to accept she was losing her hearing,"['Jenni Murray', 'Jenni Murray For The Daily Mail']","Curled up on the sofa one Saturday night, I was watching a TV drama with my family. 'Watching' being the right word, as most of what was being said escaped me.

Being someone who prides herself on her immaculate diction, I complained loudly, and in a slightly snooty manner, about: 'These young actors. They mumble away. No one's ever taught them how to speak properly. They don't articulate correctly. Why don't they speak up?'

Yet no one else in the room — my husband, David, and sons, Ed and Charlie — appeared to be having any difficulty following the plot. They were all gripped by the story and ignored my whingeing. In the end I got up in a huff, left the room to make a coffee, then stomped upstairs to read.

I refused even to think that I might be going deaf. I wasn't old, I was only in my 60s. Everyone always told me how young I looked.

Jenni Murray explains how she refused even to think that she might be going deaf. She wasn't old, she was only in my 60s

The idea of needing a hearing aid was preposterous and I wasn't going there. I would just turn up the sound on the TV and radio and, at work, the headphones I wear in the studio could be as loud as I needed. I convinced myself there was no problem. I would just carry on as usual.

Fast forward another four years and my son, Charlie, popped round for dinner. It was just the two of us and, as he was clearing the table and loading the dishwasher, I went through to the sitting room to switch on the TV.

'Crikey, Mum!' came a shriek from the kitchen. 'Are you trying to entertain the entire street? That's so loud!'

He bounded into the room, snatched the remote control from my hand and checked the sound level.

'Mum, you've got it on level 56. It shouldn't be more than 25 — 30 at the most. It's ridiculous. You can't hear properly. You are now definitely going to get your hearing checked.'

She says the idea of needing a hearing aid was preposterous and she wasn't going there. She would just turn up the sound on the TV and radio

Despite my protests, he stayed on the case, supervising the making of an appointment with the GP and then the audiology clinic, and accompanying me to the test. He was right. I had significant hearing loss.

In a bit of a daze, I discussed which aids would be best and tried out different models. The ones that go right inside the ear didn't feel comfortable, so I tried a type with a tiny earpiece which goes inside the entrance to the ear and is attached to a battery compartment behind.

Basically, it works as a little amplifier, making everything just that little bit louder and clearer. It's an astonishing piece of kit and — as everyone was at pains to reassure me — barely noticeable, especially with my hair styled over my ears.

When I first put the aids in, it was a revelation. Suddenly, everyone seemed to be articulating perfectly. I could hear taps dripping, leaves rustling, and no one on TV mumbled, even with the volume at a 'normal' 25 to 30.

My husband was delighted he could talk to me without being constantly interrupted with a stream of, 'Sorry, what did you say?', 'Pardon?', or 'What?'.

But did I wear them? Did I heck. Apart from a few rare outings, after that first day, the little box went straight into a drawer in my dressing table, and there it stayed for months.

Her husband was delighted he could talk to me without being constantly interrupted with a stream of, 'Sorry, what did you say?', 'Pardon?', or 'What?'

I just couldn't bring myself to put them in.

Why is this? It's curious that other signs of ageing have barely bothered me at all.

When the first grey hairs began to peep through the brown in my early 40s, I was off to the hairdresser like a shot. I've had it dyed every six weeks ever since.

And I was 45 when I began to realise I could no longer read my newspaper without bringing the pages closer and closer to my eyes.

I went to the optician and learned from her that the lens in the eye is the first part of the body to suffer from the ageing process, as it begins to dry and can't function properly.

Yet, I happily purchased a pair of glasses. I was relieved to find I could see perfectly again and made my specs something of a feature, permanently perched on the end of my nose.

I felt no shame at the need for aids to sight and good hair, so why were hearing aids such an embarrassment for me?

She says she felt no shame at the need for aids to sight and good hair, so why were hearing aids such an embarrassment for her?

In this age of openness, deafness seems to be the last taboo. Sex is way out there, as are periods, breast and prostate cancer, mental illness, erectile dysfunction — with the menopause the latest to join the subjects that used to be considered too private and embarrassing to be aired in polite company, but are now perfectly acceptable to discuss with anyone willing to listen.

So why not our failing ears?

There are 11 million people with hearing loss in the UK; that's about one in six of us. And more than 40 per cent of over-50s have hearing loss, rising to 71 per cent of those over the age of 70.

Most people become hard of hearing as they get older because of wear and tear to the tiny hair cells in the inner ear. These are the receptors that pick up sound waves and send them to the brain to be interpreted.

Once they're gone, they're gone. They do not grow back.

Yet many people, like me, live in denial and pretend it's not a problem.

Earlier this month, I read in this newspaper how there is mounting evidence suggesting that gradual, undiagnosed hearing problems play a big role in the onset of dementia.

Gill Livingston, professor of psychiatry of older people at University College London, advised checking things out in your 40s and early 50s in case you need a hearing aid.

I looked for more details of relevant research. In a study carried out by Professor Helene Amieva in France, highlighted in March 2018 by the Alzheimer's Society, nearly 4,000 people over the age of 65 were monitored for 25 years. The researchers found that mild hearing loss doubles the risk of developing dementia, moderate loss leads to three times the risk and severe loss to five times the risk.

According to the charity Action on Hearing Loss, nearly three-quarters of us over the age of 70 suffer some reduction in our ability to hear.

Researchers at Johns Hopkins University, in the U.S., believe the social isolation caused by being unable to hear clearly can have serious effects on mental and physical health.

When you can't hear well you have to work harder to make sense of what's being said, so the brain suffers. Too much mental energy has to be used for day to day conversation, leaving none for memory or other cognitive functions. They also believe the strain on the brain may cause a change in how the brain is structured, which could be related to the effects of Alzheimer's.

I discovered recently that I am not the only one of my acquaintances to be reluctant to confess to difficulties. A couple of weeks ago I was interviewing the amazing Baroness (Joan) Bakewell about her memories of the Profumo affair and the trial of Christine Keeler. Joan and I go back a long way.

We were colleagues on Newsnight in the early Eighties and she's always a joy to interview. She's now 86 and as sharp as ever, but, just before we began the broadcast, she quietly asked me to speak up. She put her hand to her ear and said she had a 'little difficulty'. No hearing aid. I spoke up.

Looking back, I think my aversion to the whole concept of deafness may well go back to my childhood and may be a response to the behaviour of my father and my grandmother.

My father had been very hard of hearing for as long as he could remember. He never wore a hearing aid and did badly at school until his teachers realised he was a bright boy, but maybe needed to sit at the front of the class in order to hear what was being said.

As an adult, he communicated with the family by asking us to shout, the TV was always on full blast and, with strangers, he would simply pretend he could hear.

He would feign interest and pop in the occasional 'yes' or 'no' as he thought might be appropriate. It frequently wasn't, and it was a chance encounter with an ear, nose and throat surgeon, who spotted the signs of his deafness, that led to an operation which enabled him to hear clearly for the first time in his life. He was 50.

My grandmother's problems began in her 50s. Her GP advised a hearing test and she was given an aid. She never wore it, despite constant encouragement from the entire family.

'No,' she would say, 'it's an ugly-looking thing and it's noisy.'

She was right. A silver box, about the size of a mobile phone, was attached to the ear piece by a long wire. It was far from discreet and every so often it would howl and screech.

I couldn't blame her for leaving it on her mantelpiece, but I know it made her later years difficult. She could barely hear the TV or radio and sat back quietly, like my father had, pretending to hear conversations but making no contribution. And, as she reached her 70s, she became increasingly withdrawn, scatty and forgetful.

She was never diagnosed with dementia, but I'm sure she was going that way before her death from a stroke at 76.

However, recently, something made me see it was time to overcome my embarrassment.

David and I went to a restaurant with my son, Ed, and his fiancee, Liz. She's Irish and has the softest, sweetest, lilting voice. David and Ed are both softly spoken. I hardly heard a thing. What a waste, what a shame. By not being able to hear, I'd had to retreat into a muffled, lonely world, and missed out on the sort of precious family interaction on which we thrive.

When we got home, I went straight to the little box on my dressing table, took out 'my ears' as my son, Charlie, calls them, slipped in a couple of new batteries and popped them in.

So that's it. No more shame, no more embarrassment. I'll just put the things in, listen, enjoy conversation again, give my brain the workout it deserves and hope to be able to walk into a room without forgetting what I came for.

Fingers crossed, as my 70th birthday approaches, I haven't left it too late.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8018011/You-heard-Im-deaf-JENNI-MURRAY-refused-accept-losing-hearing.html
478,"If the woke Fashion Week warriors really cared about saving the planet, they'd abolish themselves","['Janet Street-Porter', 'Janet Street-Porter For Mailonline']","The weather forecast has become drearily repetitive; tonight - rain, tomorrow - rain, and for the foreseeable future - wind and rain. Not that celebrities attending London Fashion week were that bothered, judging by their outfits.

In the run-up to the shows, we were told that designers were highly 'concerned' about the environment, determined to use ethical fabrics, cut waste and committed to recycling.

What happened? Welcome to the trendy world of eco-chic fake 'awareness'.

I spotted stick insect Alexa Chung in a dress by JW Anderson that seemed to have lost a big part of it's sides…maybe that's what they meant about cutting waste.

Naomi Campbell arriving at the Burberry Fashion Show during London Fashion Week on February 17

Naomi Campbell arrived at the Burberry show wearing a coat that combined black leather, snakeskin and pony (hopefully all fake) festooned with glittery buttons, an orgy of excess.

The front row at Burberry featured junior celebs like Madonna's daughter Lourdes wearing so many free checked clothes I almost got a migraine.

One designer featured tulle frocks - worn over hand knitted cardigans - I suppose that's 'craft' of a kind. The fabulous Billy Porter turned up wearing a show-stopping new outfit every couple of hour.

From frocks to tropical prints, he had every base covered - hardly an advert for restraint. Even Victoria Beckham's kids weren't wearing recycled gear from a charity shop but brand new sweaters and jackets by Dior.

I searched the catwalks in vain for evidence of those 'eco-friendly' garments we had been promised.Preen by Thornton Bregazzi featured lovely clothes in georgette made from plastic waste with buttons made from nuts.

Alexa Chung is seen wearing brown coat, black dress outside JW Anderson during London Fashion Week February 2020 on February 17, 2020 in London

A well-intentioned gesture, but a few nut buttons are hardly going to reduce the number of bushfires or freak flooding over the coming months.

How about turning last year's unsold clothes into carpets, curtains and home furnishings for the flood victims?

The fashion world doesn't really do 'environment', does it? After all, the whole point of the industry is to brainwash us into buying clothes we don't really need.

One bunch of 'ethical influencers' make a living posting lists of their favourite charity shops. Do they expect a medal for wearing old shoes or pre-loved blouses? It's hardly new.

This week, I wore a camel coat my mother had bought in 1955 to work. Voluminous, it hides a multitude of sins - perfect when you feel crap.

My 'vintage' choice was met with reverent praise, as if I'd single handedly rowed a boat up the Severn and rescued a few flooded families. Let's be honest, this kind of recycling is meaningless, my wardrobe is packed with sweaters, trainers and jeans for every hour of the week.

If you want to stop waste (and the fashion industry produces more than almost any other) - just stop buying!

FKA Twigs and Naomi Campbell attend the Burberry Autumn/Winter 2020 show during London Fashion Week

As fashion editors waffle the same bilge as last year about hemlines and evening frocks (I know - I used to be one of them), flood victims (quite justifiably) complain that no one in power really cares. Why haven't they had a visit from bouncy Boris?

Perhaps he has been too busy sorting out the final cost of his divorce to make the trip to South Wales or Worcestershire. In Herefordshire, the River Wye has reached it's highest level since 1795, and still the waters keep rising.

Building flood defences will never be able to help everyone, but good politicians know the value of a sympathetic trip to voters who have seen their cherished possessions ruined by thick mud. Even Prince Charles is better at this than our current PM.

At least the Prince has been talking about climate change for decades, growing organic food and wearing coats his great grandfather bought in 1925.

The Prince uses jets and is surrounded by luxury and fawning servants, but on the subject of saving the planet he cannot be faulted for sticking to the same script for decades.

He's not popping down to Wholefoods for a bag of hand picked corn or wearing (like Meghan) what has been described as 'luxe' knitted plastic pumps costing the equivalent of a week's wages for most workers. He's wearing the same brogues he wore twenty years ago, albeit polished by a minion to almost-new shininess.

The floods have hit ordinary people with so little to lose. A hairdressing salon, village pubs and cafés, retirement cottages - all devastated.

Many owners will be uninsured, most will have savings, and any government help with be capped at a low level. But the new 'woke' eco warriors aren't exactly rushing to the Welsh valleys to help bail them out.

They prefer a pompous pronouncement and a mindless stunt for maximum publicity.

This week, Extinction Rebellion dug up a pristine lawn at Trinity College in Cambridge to protest at investment in fossil fuels, and plans to turn a farm into a business park. What did this silly stunt achieve? Publicity - the essential oxygen required by modern eco-warriors.

Yes, the same bloke who's made millions by participating in a sport which burns gallons of fuel, fills the air with fumes and produces a disgusting level of noise pollution.

Are his tyres being made from recycled waste? Is he wearing clothes from charity shops? Declaring yourself a vegan and flogging your £25 million private jet is not enough to save one street, let alone a continent.

Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world, has just pledged $10 billion to flight climate change.

A pity he didn't make that his priority before he unleashed literally millions of vehicles on our streets carrying his wares, packaged in massive boxes, with wasteful over-sized containers galore. How many trees does Bezos cull in a day?

Elon Musk is another faux-environmentalist - planning to build a huge new factory to produce his electric cars in Germany.

Sadly he didn't bother to get permission before construction workers started tearing down trees on the site near Berlin, a nature reserve and home to endangered bats and sand lizards.

I bet Mr Musk will be finding a smart way to deal with bat and tree issues so that production of 150,000 vehicles a year can start without delay.

479,No10 faces questions over ousted 'super-forecaster' Andrew Sabisky,"['James Tapsfield', 'Political Editor For Mailonline']","Maverick No10 chief Dominic Cummings voiced defiance today despite a Tory backlash over adviser Andrew Sabisky, who was ousted over vile social media posts.

Mr Cummings insisted people should not listen to 'political pundits who don't know what they are talking about' as he was challenged by reporters on whether he regretted the appointment.

Mr Sabisky - a self-style 'superforecaster' - quit last night amid fury at past comments in which he talked about forced contraception of the 'underclass' and suggested black people had lower IQs.

The 27-year-old is thought to have been working as a contractor on defence and other policy areas, but Downing Street has not confirmed the details or whether he went through background checks.

Meanwhile, other historic posts have surfaced in which Mr Sabisky apparently advised a woman that her boyfriend liking pornography about incest, paedophilia and rape was not 'all that much to worry about'.

According to Reddit posts unearthed by The National, Mr Sabisky also said he had 'a thing for incest erotica myself despite never having had those fantasies relating to my actual family'.

Mr Sabisky had been one of the first 'weirdos and misfits' recruited under a drive by Mr Cummings.

In a thinly-veiled swipe today, business minister Kwasi Kwarteng said there must be 'much more severe' vetting in No10 so the same mistakes could not 'happen again'.

'What I do know is his remarks were offensive and racist and as soon as they came to light he left the government pretty quickly,' Mr Kwarteng told Sky News.

One Cabinet minister who lost their job in the reshuffle told ITV News that Mr Cummings 'can't afford any more Sabiskys'.

But accosted by reporters outside his London home, Mr Cummings insisted the government needed 'superforecasters' rather than 'political pundits who don't know what they're talking about'.

Announcing his resignation last night, Andrew Sabisky (pictured) said he joined the government to do 'real work' and claimed he was the victim of 'a giant character assassination'

Mr Sabisky announced on Twitter last night that he was steeping down from his role as a Downing Street adviser

Accosted by reporters outside his London home today, Dominic Cummings said the government needed 'super-forecasters' rather than 'political pundits who don't know what they're talking about'

Asked whether Boris Johnson (pictured) condemned the comments yesterday, the PM's deputy spokesman merely said: 'The PM's views are well publicised and documented.'

Business minister Kwasi Kwarteng said he did not know what checks had been carried out of what work Mr Sabisky was doing

But after a major backlash he announced last night he was stepping down due to 'media hysteria' and to avoid being a 'distraction' for the government.

He tweeted: 'Hey all, The media hysteria about my old stuff online is mad but I wanted to help HMG not be a distraction.

'Accordingly I've decided to resign as a contractor. I hope no.10 hires more ppl w/ good geopolitical forecasting track records & that media learn to stop selective quoting.'

In another tweet soon after Mr Sabisky added that he joined the government team to do 'real work' and claimed he was the victim of 'a giant character assassination'.

He wrote: 'I know this will disappoint a lot of ppl but I signed up to do real work, not be in the middle of a giant character assassination: if I can't do the work properly there's no point, & I have a lot of other things to do w/ my life.'

Dominic Cummings heaps praise on 'Superforecasting' book by Philip Tetlock The book recommended by Dominic Cummings was written by Professor Philip Tetlock and Dan Gardner. It has been hailed as a breakthrough in decision-making, suggesting that a certain breed of amateur forecasters tend to do better than supposed experts. The book, published in 2015, was based on data from Prof Tetlock's Good Judgement Project, which continually assessed teams on their forecasts for a range of geopolitical issues. The personality of superforecasters, rather than any special insider knowledge, is said to allow them to outperform even some intelligence agencies.

Reddit posts from seven years ago were highlighted by The National today in which Mr Sabisky, apparently acting as an agony uncle, offered advice to a woman who found 'disturbing porn' on her boyfriend's computer, including erotic fiction about incest, paedophilia and rape.

Mr Sabisky reportedly told her he didn't 'see all that much to worry about here'.

'Fantasies are strange things. Unpredictable, of uncertain origin, hard to figure how they'll relate to real life. I have a thing for incest erotica myself despite never having had those fantasies relating to my actual family. So long as he's not actually breaking any laws and is restricting his viewing habits to girls 18 and up I wouldn't be too squicked.'

He also reportedly told a Mormon man that his wife was 'not very Christian' for rebutting his sexual advances. 'Theologically speaking she is your wife and should submit to you as unto the Lord,' he reportedly wrote.

Before the resignation, No10 refused to comment on Mr Sabisky's appointment to the role.

Asked whether Mr Johnson condemned the comments, the PM's deputy spokesman merely said: 'The Prime Minister's views are well publicised and documented.'

A photograph of Mr Sabisky standing in front of 10 Downing Street has emerged on Twitter.

The photo was published by fellow 'super-forecaster' Michael Story on January 17 of this year. It showed Mr Sabisky alongside Mr Story and Thomas Liptay.

Mr Story and Mr Liptay are both co-founders of an app designed to improve the accuracy of forecasts.

Asked today whether he regretted the appointment of Mr Sabisky, Mr Cummings told reporters: 'Read Philip Tetlock's 'Superforecasting' instead of political pundits who don't know what they are talking about.'

But Mr Kwarteng delivered a thinly-veiled rebuke to Mr Cummings over the row.

'I don't know how this man appeared on the horizon, I don't know how he was recruited,' he said.

'What I do know is that his remarks were offensive and racist and as soon as they came to light, he left the Government pretty quickly.'

Tory MP Caroline Nokes, chairwoman of the Commons Women and Equalities Committee, said she was 'relieved' Mr Sabisky had resigned, but criticised the 'silence' from Downing Street.

Former immigration minister Ms Nokes told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I'm relieved that Mr Sabisky has resigned.

Fresh controversy over Reddit posts Reddit posts from seven years ago were highlighted by The National today in which Andrew Sabisky, apparently acting as an agony uncle, offered advice to users. One exchange was with a woman who found 'disturbing porn' on her boyfriend's computer, including erotic fiction about incest, paedophilia and rape. Mr Sabisky reportedly told her he didn't 'see all that much to worry about here'. 'Fantasies are strange things. Unpredictable, of uncertain origin, hard to figure how they'll relate to real life. I have a thing for incest erotica myself despite never having had those fantasies relating to my actual family. So long as he's not actually breaking any laws and is restricting his viewing habits to girls 18 and up I wouldn't be too squicked.' On another occasion a Mormon man asked advice over his wife rebutting his sexual advances. He was told that his wife was 'not very Christian' and should 'rewire' her brain. 'Theologically speaking she is your wife and should submit to you as unto the Lord,' Mr Sabisky reportedly wrote.

'I was disappointed that yesterday there was silence from Downing Street regarding his previous comments and it does seem that when the call went out for misfits and weirdos that was exactly what Downing Street got.'

She added: 'I think he needed to come out earlier and explain himself, he needed to apologise for those comments and unfortunately we had 48 hours of almost complete silence and no comment from Downing Street, who could have distanced themselves from his youthful comments at any point, but they chose not to do so.'

It follows a series of other historic posts prompted a furious reaction.

Writing on Mr Cummings' website in 2014, Mr Sabisky said: 'One way to get around the problems of unplanned pregnancies creating a permanent underclass would be to legally enforce universal uptake of long-term contraception at the onset of puberty.

'Vaccination laws give it a precedent, I would argue.'

In another post being circulated on social media, Mr Sabisky claimed black people had lower IQs than white people.

In the article, entitled 'Disabilities by race' he reportedly said: 'If the mean black American IQ is (best estimate based on a century's worth of data) around 85, as compared to a mean white American IQ of 100, then if IQ is normally distributed, you will see a far greater percentage of blacks than whites in the range of IQs 75 or below, at which point we are close to the typical boundary for mild mental retardation.'

On the issue of FGM, he reportedly wrote: 'It is still unclear to what extent FGM represents a serious risk to young girls, raised in the UK, of certain minority group origins. Much of the hue and cry looks more like a moral panic.'

He also once tweeted that former defence secretaries Penny Mordaunt and Gavin Williamson - both now back in government - were 'proper morons'.

Sarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘We lost a dozen years of wage growth to the financial crisis, but we’re finally emerging from the other side – pay is now higher than it was back in March 2008.’

The fact that it has taken well over a decade to reach this moment highlights the devastating toll of the financial crisis on households.

The ONS employment report delivered a series of records. The number in work surged by 180,000 – or 1,956 a day – between October and December to hit a new high of 32.93million. The employment rate, which nudged up from 76.3 per cent, was the highest since records began half a century ago. Record numbers of women in work – 15.61million – has driven the boom while the number in full-time employment also hit an all-time high of 24.42million. Meanwhile the jobless rate of 3.8 per cent is at a 45-year low with 1.29million people unemployed – 73,000 fewer than a year ago. Experts said the surge was all the more impressive as it came as the economy flat-lined in the final three months of last year. Separate figures released last week by the ONS revealed the economy – as measured by gross domestic product –did not grow at all between October and November.

Millions of workers who managed to hang on to their jobs endured a pay freeze, or meagre pay rises in the years after the financial crisis. In many cases any rises were wiped out by inflation, meaning households across the country were seeing the spending power of their pay packets fall.

Nye Cominetti, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation think-tank, said: ‘The return to record pay at the end of 2019 marks an important – and welcome – milestone.

‘However, the fact that it has taken 12 years to get to this point shows what a living standards disaster our pay packets have been.

‘Workers are, on average, nearly £150 a week worse off than if the pre-crisis pay growth had continued.’

The milestone was reached despite a slowdown in wage growth, with average earnings not adjusted for inflation up 3.2 per cent in the year to December, down from 3.4 per cent in November.

Average total pay packets including bonuses are still 3.7 per cent short of pre-financial crisis levels.

Myrto Miltiadou, deputy head of labour market statistics at the ONS, said: ‘In real terms, regular earnings have finally risen above the level seen in early 2008, but pay including bonuses is still below its pre-downturn peak.’

Yesterday ministers pointed out that wages are growing significantly faster than inflation, which is boosting the spending power of millions of homes.

Employment minister Mims Davies said: ‘With wages still outpacing inflation, UK workers can expect their money to go further as we look ahead to a decade of renewal.

‘The upcoming Budget will steer us on that course, further driving our levelling up agenda - so we can all share in the country’s prosperity.’",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8018227/Pay-creeps-higher-pre-financial-crash-2008.html
481,Autumn Phillips' brother and mother confirm she will NOT be returning to live in Canada as,"['Ruth Styles', 'Ruth Styles In Montreal', 'Quebec', 'For Dailymail.Com']","Autumn Phillips still 'loves England' and will not be returning to live in her native Canada, DailyMail.com can disclose.

Last week, it was revealed that the 41-year-old has separated from Peter, her husband of 12 years who is the Queen's eldest grandchild and cousin to William and Harry.

It had been widely reported that Canadian Autumn is planning a move back to her native Montreal, along with daughters Savannah, nine, and Isla, seven.

But speaking exclusively to DailyMail.com, Autumn's older brother Kevin, 43, said his sister has no plans to return to Canada and is still happy living on Princess Anne's Gatcombe Park estate in Gloucestershire, UK.

It was revealed that Autumn Philips separated from Peter, her husband of 12 years who is the Queen's eldest grandchild and cousin to William and Harry. There had been reports that she would move back to Montreal with daughter's Savannah, nine, and Isla, seven

Autumn's older brother Kevin, 43, and her mother Kathleen tell DailyMail.com that Autumn no plans to return to their native Canada and is still happy living in the UK

The divorced father-of-two said: 'She loves England very much and she's going to stay there. She's always been happy with that part.'

Asked how his sister is coping with the split, Kevin, a former chef who now works for car leasing firm LA Leasing, declined to comment, saying: 'Ooh, that's too much. No, I can't comment on that.'

Autumn's mother, who lives in the 41-year-old's childhood home in the Pointe-Claire neighborhood of Montreal, also said her daughter wouldn't be returning to Canada.

Asked whether Autumn is planning to follow in Meghan Markle's footsteps and leave the UK, hairdresser Kathleen Magas said: 'No, no, no, she's not.'

Like her son, she also declined to comment further.

Autumn has been married to Peter Phillips, who is the son of Princess Anne and her first husband Captain Mark Phillips, for 12 years.

When the pair wed in 2008, Phillips was the first of the Queen's grandchildren to marry – and will now be the first to divorce.

According to a statement released by Buckingham Palace Tuesday, both families were informed prior to the announcement.

The statement continued: 'After informing HM The Queen and members of both families last year, Peter and Autumn jointly agreed to separate.

'They had reached the conclusion that this was the best course of action for their two children and ongoing friendship. The decision to divorce and share custody came about after many months of discussions and although sad, is an amicable one.

'The couple's first priority will remain the continued wellbeing and upbringing of their wonderful daughters Savannah and Isla.

'Both families were naturally sad at the announcement, but fully supportive of Peter and Autumn in the joint decision to co-parent their children.'

Asked whether Autumn is planning to follow in Meghan Markle's footsteps and leave the UK, hairdresser Kathleen Magas said: 'No, no, no, she's not'

Despite the split, Peter Phillips was mentioned in an obituary for one of Autumn's aunts who died at the end of September

The split is understood to have been on the cards for months, with the Queen informed of the former couple's plans as long ago as last summer.

Sources told DailyMail.com that the break-up is more of a 'conscious uncoupling' than a dramatic split and that no one else is believed to be involved.

When the pair wed in 2008, Phillips was the first of the Queen's grandchildren to marry – and will now be the first to divorce

But while the Queen was told promptly of their plans over the summer, DailyMail.com can reveal that Autumn's family were not told as speedily - with Phillips getting a mention in an obituary for one of her aunts who died at the end of September.

Jill Smith, who lived in Moncton, New Brunswick, was the youngest sister of Autumn's father Brian - one of seven children born to Autumn's grandparents Tim and Ivy Kelly.

In an obituary written by her husband Gary – a former strip club boss who now runs the Moncton branch of hotel chain Days Inn – Jill is remembered as a loving aunt.

It goes on: 'She is also survived by her nieces and nephews: Kevin, Chris (Victoria), Autumn (Peter), Alison (Mark), Erin (Spencer), Ian (Holly), Tyler, Wesley, Stephen, Kieran (Emily), Ryan, Nick, Patrick, Regan and Jessica.'

Neither Kathleen nor Kevin would comment on when they heard the news of the split.

Her father Brian, who now lives in Peterborough, Ontario with his second wife Lynne, and twin brother Chris, a bricklayer, have also declined to comment on the break-up.

The impending divorce comes in the wake of a string of Royal crises, among them the departure of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex for Canada and Prince Andrew's well-publicized friendship with pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

Meghan and Harry had initially claimed that they would divide their time between the UK and 'North America' but the Daily Mail revealed on Friday that the pair have now laid off their 15-strong British team of advisors.

The pair are currently believed to be holed up in a $14million mansion in North Saanich, Vancouver Island, close to where Meghan was pictured walking her dogs three weeks ago.

Prince Andrew has maintained a low profile since plunging the Royal Family into crisis in November when he gave a disastrous interview defending his friendship with Epstein to the BBC's Panorama program

Details of how the couple plan to fund their luxury lifestyle have also emerged, with the two making a brief trip to Miami, Florida, last week to address a banking event.

The pair are understood to have taken a private jet, owned by JP Morgan Chase, to the upmarket event and are believed to have earned as much as $1million for a speech in which Prince Harry spoke of spending years in therapy in a bid to recover from his mother Princess Diana's death in 1997.

Meanwhile, Prince Andrew has maintained a low profile since plunging the Royal Family into crisis in November when he gave a disastrous interview defending his friendship with Epstein to the BBC's Panorama program.

In it, he also declined to empathize with Epstein's victims and claimed that he could not have had sex with Virginia Roberts Giuffre because he was at a branch of Pizza Express in Woking, UK, on the night in question.

Like Meghan and Harry, Andrew was made to relinquish his royal duties in the wake of the furor and step back from a number of patronages.

It also was confirmed earlier this month that the Union Jack will now not be flown outside public buildings to mark his 60th birthday on February 19 in a break with tradition.

The Union Jack is usually raised in the UK to mark the birthdays of all the senior royals, including Prince Charles and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8012837/Autumn-Phillips-brother-mother-confirm-NOT-returning-live-Canada-as.html
482,PICTURED: Scantily-clad women dancing at 'nightclub' on fashion exec Peter Nygard's Bahamas compound,"['Megan Sheets', 'Megan Sheets For Dailymail.Com']","Pictures of Canadian fashion mogul Peter Nygard partying with women in the Bahamas have emerged just days after he was accused of luring at least 10 teenage girls to the compound and sexually assaulting them.

Millionaire Nygard, who has links to Prince Andrew, is seen grinning and soaked with sweat as he watches three women dressed in tiny bikinis gyrate against each other inside his private nightclub on the property dubbed Nygard Cay.

Andrew visited Nygard at his lavish estate in 2000, after the fashion designer had agreed out-of-court settlements with three employees who accused him of sexual harassment.

The prince and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson stayed at Nygard Cay, near Nassau, with daughters Beatrice and Eugenie.

The pictures emerged days after Nygard, 78, was accused of plying teenage girls with drugs and alcohol at the property before sexually assaulting them.

The images, obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com, were taken in the summer of 2007. There is no suggestion that any of the women in the pictures were sexually assaulted by Nygard, or that they have made such complaints.

In one frame he is seen holding onto a woman's bare bottom as she leans over, while others show him playing poker with a table of at least six female guests.

The photos, which were taken in the summer of 2007, emerged days after Nygard was accused of luring at least 10 teenage girls to the island compound, where he allegedly plied them with drugs and alcohol before sexually assaulting them

In one frame he is seen holding onto a woman's bare bottom as she leans over

Nygard is seen grinning and soaked with sweat as he watches three women dressed in tiny bikinis gyrate against each other inside his private nightclub on the property

Nygard, the owner of fashion empire Nygard International who has an estimated net worth just shy of $1billion, is said to have previously hosted several A-listers at the compound, including Prince Andrew, Oprah Winfrey and former president George H.W. Bush.

None of the celebrities or other people who visited Nygard at the compound are being accused of knowing anything about what went on there or knowing anything about his parties.

Ten women say they were raped by the mogul at the compound.

The women filed a class-action lawsuit against Nygard in the Southern District of New York last Thursday, which claims that he ran a 'sex-trafficking ring' at the island home.

The suit alleges that Nygard lured 'young, impressionable, and often impoverished children and women' to his Mayan-themed vacation home in the Bahamas with cash payments and promises to launch their modelling careers.

Once the arrived, the girls were entertained at so-called 'pamper parties' where Nygard would have bartenders spike their drinks with the date-rape drug Rohypnol.

Nygard allegedly kept a database with details about each guest, which he would consult before picking a 'victim' to target at the weekly parties.

Prince Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson reportedly visited Nygard's island getaway around June 2000. There is no evidence to suggest Andrew knew anything about Nygård's alleged activities, but the connection could prove embarrassing for the Prince, who has already faced intense scrutiny for his relationship with pedophile Jeffrey Epstein

A new lawsuit claims Nygard held weekly 'pamper parties' at his island mansion, where he allegedly had bartenders spike female guest's drinks with the date-rape drug Rohypnol

In other photos from the 2007 party Nygard is seen at a poker table surrounded by six women

None of the women in the photos have been identified

There is no suggestion that any of the women in the pictures were sexually assaulted by Nygard, or that they have made such complaints

The suit claims he would approach the targets and invite them to join him in the hot tub or his bedroom, where a rape would then occur.

The accusers, who were not named but are now between the ages of 18 and 36, detailed their alleged encounters with Nygard in the chilling suit.

Nine of the women are from the Bahamas while one is from the United States.

Ten women filed a class-action lawsuit against Nygard (pictured in 2016) last Thursday, which claims that he ran a 'sex-trafficking ring' at the island home

Three of the women were 14-years-old at the time of the alleged rapes, which took place between 2008 and 2015, while three others were 15.

One alleged victim claimed that Nygard tried to have anal sex with her before he raped her and then asked her to defecate and urinate in his mouth, a bizarre sexual fetish known as Coprophilia.

The suit says Nygard offered that victim $5,000 before the rape and later offered an additional $10,000 if she defecated in his mouth.

Another plaintiff said her encounter with Nygard began with him showing her pornography.

Nygard then asked her to use a sex toy on him, after which he raped her, 'causing her extraordinary trauma and pain', the suit states.

'This horrific episode is just one of many like it detailed in the complaint against Nygard and his business entities by 10 brave women,' a press release about the lawsuit states.

'The class action lawsuit accuses Nygard of sex trafficking and rape — all financed and facilitated by his family of corporations and their employees.'

Nygard is said to have hosted several A-listers at his 4.5-acre compound, including Prince Andrew, Oprah Winfrey and former president George H.W. Bush

The Mayan-inspired property boasts a 32,000-sq-ft grand hall with a 100,000lb glass ceiling, 12 themed cabanas, an aquarium, helipad and casino

A spokesperson for Nygard told the New York Post that the lawsuit was 'the latest in a 10+ year string of attempts to try to destroy the reputation of a man through false statements.'

'The allegations are completely false, without foundation and are vigorously denied,' Ken Frydman said in a statement.

'Peter Nygard looks forward to fully exposing this scam and once and for all clearing his name.'

Jay Prober, a lawyer in Winnipeg representing Nygard, told the Globe & Mail the accusations in the class action suit were false.

While Nygard has been accused of sexual misconduct and rape in the past, the latest lawsuit goes further in alleging that he was able to escape punishment by 'resorting to violence, intimidation, bribery, and payoffs' to silence his alleged victims'.

When suspicions were raised by local authorities in the Bahamas, it's alleged Nygard would get away with such behavior by offering everyone from cops to government officials bribes for them to turn a blind eye.

It also alleges Nygard 'initiated a scheme to purchase police protection and political cover in the Bahamas by making regular payments of tens of thousands of dollars to law enforcement, government officials, regulators and even to a former cabinet minister who became the prime minister of the Bahamas.'

The suit goes on to state how Nygard 'employed a network of company employees under his direction' who would lure victims to his place, especially 'young, vulnerable and impoverished Bahamian girls,' the suit alleges.

It further claims 'Nygard also paid people, using Nygard Company money, to intimidate his former ""girlfriends"" by slashing their tires, committing arson, paying police to threaten to arrest them and by having them followed'.

'The Nygard Companies fund all of Nygard's ""pamper parties"" by transferring cash from the company's bank account in Canada and routing it through New York,' the lawsuit says.

'Nygard's destruction of innocent lives is immeasurable,' it declares.

'When Nygard became aware of the investigation into his sex trafficking ring, he resorted to tactics of violence, intimidation, bribery and payoffs to attempt to silence the victims and to continue his scheme.'

A spokesperson for Nygard (pictured in 2014) called the New York lawsuit 'the latest in a 10+ year string of attempts to try to destroy the reputation of a man through false statements'

Nygard, who according to the filing is worth approximately $900million, owns homes in New York, California and Florida.

The suit alleges that women were moved around between the properties by private jet and that Nygard broke US laws under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act in the process.

The filing asks for the Manhattan court to prohibit Nygard from engaging in unlawful acts, and for 'damages in an amount to be determined at trial.'

'The facts detailed in the complaint come from years of investigation. After hearing these tragic stories, we were compelled to act,' said Greg Gutzler, a New York lawyer.

'We know many others were afraid to come forward initially and hope that this lawsuit will pave the way for them to also seek justice,' Gutzler said in a press release.

'The facts in this case represent the tip of the iceberg of an international sex trafficking ring that ends today.'

Although there is a 10-year statute of limitations for cases like such as this under New York law. the lawsuit requests the scope be extended because the complainants 'were impeded because of a combination of force, threats of force, shame, embarrassment, fear, political and law enforcement corruption, weak laws that are rarely enforced to protect the victim and bribery.'

Nygard purchased his 150,000-square-foot beachfront mansion on the Lyford Cay peninsula in New Providence, Bahamas, in 1987

The property was once featured on the TV show Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous

Nygard was born in Finland but moved to Winnipeg, Canada, at a young age.

483,Government tells 'coronavirus cruise' passengers they may NOT be allowed on evacuation flight,"['Joe Middleton', 'Sam Blanchard', 'Stephen Matthews', 'Tim Stickings For Mailonline']","Advertisement

Another 79 people have today tested positive for coronavirus on board the Diamond Princess, as some passengers started to leave the ship but Britons were warned to stay put while officials charter a rescue plane.

The dozens of new cases bring the total to 621 despite the official end of the two-week quarantine today.

Some passengers were whisked away in buses and taxis after leaving the ship in Yokohama this morning, after Japanese authorities declared them free of the virus.

But the 74 Britons on board have been warned that if they leave the ship today, they might be barred from the rescue flight which is due to depart from Tokyo 'later this week'.

British virus patients David and Sally Abel will have to stay in Japan after testing positive yesterday. Mr Abel's son said today that his father was suffering from early-onset dementia and called the delay 'very frustrating'.

Whitehall has faced growing anger over its slow response, with 328 US citizens already back home after Washington airlifted them out on Monday, and Canadians and Australians leaving today.

Scientists have warned that the ship is an ideal breeding ground for the coronavirus, with Japan's two-week lockdown widely declared a 'failure' after more than 600 people were infected.

'We are planning an evacuation flight from Tokyo to the UK as soon as possible for Britons who are on the Diamond Princess. We hope the flight will be later this week, subject to permissions from the Japanese authorities,' a Foreign Office statement said.

'At 7am local time on Wednesday, the Diamond Princess cruise operator and Japanese authorities allowed passengers to disembark from the cruise ship.

'However there is a chance that people who disembark will not be able to join the evacuation flight. We have the utmost concern for the affected Britons and strongly encourage them to register for the evacuation flight.'

'Chaotic' lockdown was 'a major failure, completely inadequate and a mistake' says disease expert A disease expert has branded the Diamond Princess quarantine a 'major failure', 'completely inadequate' and a 'mistake'. Kentaro Iwata said he had placed himself in a 14-day quarantine for fear of infecting his family after a brief visit on board the ship yesterday. The Kobe University infectious diseases expert said conditions on the ship were 'completely chaotic' and violated quarantine rules. His video has racked up more than a million views amid a barrage of criticism of Japanese authorities. 'There was no distinction between the green zone, which is free of infection, and the red zone, which is potentially contaminated by the virus,' he said. 'I was in Africa dealing with the Ebola outbreak. I was in other countries dealing with the cholera outbreak. I was in China in 2003 to deal with SARS... I never had fear of getting infection myself. 'But inside Diamond Princess, I was so scared... because there was no way to tell where the virus is.' Mr Iwata said he had boarded the ship because he 'wanted to be useful in helping' to contain the virus. Japan's health Minister Katsunobu Kato defended the government's approach. 'Expert doctors who are members of an infection prevention team are supervising inside the ship,' he said in response to questions from opposition lawmakers. 'If symptoms develop, of course not only that person but also those who had close contact with the person are told to refrain from serving, and workers follow rules such as wearing masks and putting on gloves,' he added. 'According to experts, the infection is under control.'

Passengers who left the ship today were whisked away in yellow Yokohama buses and a fleet of taxis, many of them dragging their luggage with them.

Those with no symptoms and a negative test received an official certificate saying they posed 'no risk of infection'.

They are free to walk out and go home by public transport, Health minister Katsunobu Kato said, saying the country's National Institute of Infectious Diseases has approved the plan.

Passengers are only asked to watch their health conditions carefully for a few days and notify local health authorities if they have any symptoms or worries, he said.

'I'm relieved... I want to take a good rest,' said a 77-year-old Japanese passenger, who declined to give his name. He said he would be boarding Japan's crowded railway system to go home.

However, passengers who were close to the infected virus patients have had their 14-day quarantine clock reset to zero from the date when they last saw them.

The new cases today may add to the number, after another 79 patients were diagnosed in the latest batch of 607 test results.

Of the 79 new patients, 68 are not showing any symptoms of the virus.

In addition, the ship's crew are expected to remain in a longer quarantine after many of them came into contact with guests while delivering food or supervising passengers on deck.

Japan said yesterday that around 500 people were likely to leave the ship today, on the date which has long been scheduled for the end of the quarantine period.

Canada, Australia and Hong Kong are staging their evacuation flights today, cruise operator Princess Cruises said.

Their citizens will require an additional 14-day quarantine when they return home after the 'failed' lockdown on the Diamond Princess.

Some 328 US citizens have already been evacuated from the Diamond Princess, with two planes picking them up from nearby Tokyo over the weekend.

They will spend two weeks in quarantine on military bases in California and Texas after 14 people were confirmed as virus patients before they left the airport.

Of the 3,711 people who were on board the ship when it was quarantined, 542 have tested positive for the virus while many of the other passengers have been confined to windowless cabins on the ship.

As a result, the Diamond Princess is now the biggest cluster of coronavirus cases outside mainland China, where the outbreak began.

Some have raised concerns about allowing people from the cruise ship to board flights home or spread into the notoriously busy Japanese capital, but medics say they are free to travel.

FEBRUARY 19: Hundreds of passengers leave the ship as the quarantine officially ends. Princess Cruises confirms Australia, Hong Kong and Canada will fly their citizens back. Britain says its flight will be 'later this week' but warns that any UK nationals who leave the ship now may not be able to board the plane.

British passengers David and Sally Abel are likely to face a longer stay in Japan after they tested positive for the virus.

After some confusion last night, Mr Abel confirmed that he and his wife had been infected with the virus.

The 74-year-old from Northamptonshire had become the face of the cruise ship lockdown after sharing regular video updates from his ninth-deck cabin.

His son Steve yesterday blasted the Foreign Office for its handling of the case and urged Britain to bring his parents home despite their positive tests.

However, an FCO spokesman has already quashed those plans, saying yesterday that officials were 'ensuring the best possible care' for patients in Japan with the rescue flight arranged for 'other British nationals'.

Business minister Kwasi Kwarteng said the treatment of the Abels was now a 'matter for the Japanese authorities on the ground'.

'I can't see there's going to be any way we're on that flight to the UK,' Mr Abel acknowledged in his latest Facebook video.

Steve Abel told BBC Breakfast today that the delay was 'very frustrating', saying: 'They are just being messed about. These are two old-age pensioners. They have been through so much and I just want someone to take care of them.

'With my dad's early onset dementia ... he could wake up and be a little bit confused, so my mum needs to be there with him.'

The couple's daughter Jackie Rafferty told ITV's Good Morning Britain today that Mr Abel, who is diabetic and lactose intolerant, had been surviving on corn flakes in recent days.

'I think really for us we just want some answers as well because when they are taken off the ship is that day one again of a quarantine period?,' she asked.

'Or if they spend 45 days in a hostel and then they're taken to a hospital does day one start again at that hospital? Are they then going to be quarantined again when they come back to the UK?

'This is all the things that we want answering now, so mum and dad have a goal to look for and they know what's going to be happening.'

Her brother Sean Abel said: 'On Saturday I saw some video footage with dad, the two of them got emotional, they've been absolute rocks for the last two or three weeks.'

'I just want somebody in the UK to take ownership of this, we've got a point of contact and we're just updated as things go on, because once they get moved to the hostel, they might not have wifi, telephone, we've got no idea where they're going.'

Fellow British passenger Alan Steele, who was diagnosed with the virus on February 9, says he has now been given the all-clear by Japanese authorities.

Mr Steele was on his honeymoon with his new wife Wendy but was separated from her and taken to hospital on the mainland after testing positive.

He said that he would have to undergo another two weeks of quarantine when he arrived back in the UK.

Scientists have lined up to condemn Japan's efforts at containing the virus after another 88 people on the giant vessel tested positive yeterday, bringing the total number of infected passengers to 542.

Disease experts said the ship had now become a 'source of infection' rather than a safe haven and that keeping all the passengers on board had made the disease spread more rather than stopping it.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Japan's efforts might have slowed down the virus but were not enough.

'CDC's assessment is that it may not have been sufficient to prevent transmission among individuals on the ship,' it said in a statement.

One Japanese professor, Kentaro Iwata of Kobe University, made waves last night with a video slamming the 'chaotic' conditions on board after he visited the ship yesterday.

The infectious diseases expert said he had placed himself in a 14-day quarantine for fear of infecting his family after his brief stay on the cruise liner.



'The cruise ship was completely inadequate in terms of infection control,' said Iwata in videos which he posted in English and Japanese last night.

'There was no distinction between the green zone, which is free of infection, and the red zone, which is potentially contaminated by the virus.

'I was in Africa dealing with the Ebola outbreak. I was in other countries dealing with the cholera outbreak. I was in China in 2003 to deal with SARS... I never had fear of getting infection myself.

'But inside Diamond Princess, I was so scared... because there was no way to tell where the virus is.'

In other developments to the cruise ship crisis:

Most, if not all, of the people on board the ship are expected to face longer periods of quarantine after they get off the ship to make sure they are not infected

One expert at the New York University School of Medicine said boats were 'notorious places for being incubators for viruses' as he blasted Japan's failure to take the passengers off the ship from the start

There were still more than 3,000 people on the ship yesterday – both crew and holidaymakers – who come from countries around the world

The total number of people infected with the coronavirus has risen to more than 75,186 and 2,008 have died

The Diamond Princess (left) has had considerably more coronavirus infections than any country outside of China – Singapore, the worst hit, trails behind it with 77 cases. Almost all of the 73,000 cases have been in mainland China

BEING COOPED UP WITH OTHER PEOPLE CREATES 'BOILING POT OF TRANSMISSION'

Infections are 'notorious' for spreading easily on cruise ships because the boats have large numbers of people cooped up in a relatively small space and using the same facilities for days or weeks on end.

This raises the risk of getting close to someone who is already infected with a virus, whereas on land someone may only pass them in the street.

Past research has found that holidaymakers on-board cruise ships are less likely to maintain good hand hygiene or isolate themselves in their rooms if they become ill.

A global health lawyer in Geneva, Dr Roojin Habibi, said shutting all the passengers in together had created a 'boiling pot of transmission' for the virus, The Guardian reported.

This is particularly problematic when it comes to viruses like the coronavirus which infect the lungs and spread on someone's breath or by coughing and sneezing.

Dr Jimmy Whitworth, a disease expert at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told MailOnline: 'Obviously keeping all the people in one place increases the risk for them.

'Cruise ships are crowded and people are very close to each other. This is a respiratory virus so it's going to be spreading by droplet spread [breathing/coughing], close contact and contaminated surfaces about the place.

'This virus is highly transmissible and is tough to control in this circumstance. It was worth a go [the ship quarantine] but it's simply not worked.'

More than 3,000 holidaymakers and crew members are still in quarantine on-board the Diamond Princess and all are expected to face further quarantine when they are finally let off

WHAT ARE COUNTRIES DOING ABOUT THEIR CITIZENS ON THE DIAMOND PRINCESS? USA: The US government, on February 16 and 17, flew 340 of its citizens back to the States after evacuating them from the stranded cruise ship. They were put on board two cargo planes, which had separate isolation facilities for 14 passengers who were diagnosed with coronavirus on the way to the airport. All were taken to military bases in California and Texas to serve a further two weeks of quarantine to make sure they are not contagious. South Korea: South Korea sent one of its president's jets to Tokyo on Tuesday, February 18, to evacuate its citizens from the ship. Just five people were on board. Australia: Australia will charter a plane on Wednesday, February 18, to evacuate any of its citizens who want to return home from the ship in Yokohama. It is expected to pick up 208 people and an unknown number of New Zealand citizens. Canada: Canada will charter a flight on the same day, February 18, to take its citizens home from Tokyo if they are believed to be free of the virus. Hong Kong: Hong Kong will charter a plane to retrieve citizens on board the Diamond Princess. A person who got off the ship in Hong Kong was the first passenger to be diagnosed with coronavirus and triggered the lockdown. Italy: Italy will send a plane this week to retrieve 35 of its citizens who are on the Diamond Princess – one of whom is the captain of the ship. 25 of the Italians are crew members. No date for the evacuation has been announced yet. Israel: Israel's health ministry announced on February 17 it was speaking to insurance firms of the dozen nationals on the Diamond Princess to organise flying them home.

Writing in a scientific paper titled 'Infections on Cruise Ships', disease expert Dr Vivek Kak, from Jackson, Michigan, said: 'The isolated environment of a cruise ship, with close interaction between a vast [group] of individuals, increases the risk of a passenger being exposed to various respiratory secretions and, potentially, to infectious respiratory viruses.

'The presentation of these infections... can range from an upper respiratory tract infection to life-threatening pneumonia.'

Sharing the ship with so many others also makes it more likely someone will touch a surface which has been contaminated by someone who is ill.

The COVID-19 coronavirus is known to be able to survive on hard surfaces for hours – some estimates suggest days – before it stops being contagious.

Handrails, sunbeds or gym equipment, for example, may be a haven for the viruses to live on, and people may catch the infection from contimated surfaces in places like swimming pools or hot tubs.

VIRUSES SPREAD FASTER AMONG ELDERLY PEOPLE AND THOSE BRINGING STRAINS FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES

Dr Kak also suggested in his paper, which was published in the journal Microbiology Spectrum by the American Society for Microbiology, that the types of people who take cruises may contribute to the spread of illness.

He added: 'The typical cruise passenger is often an elderly individual and may have chronic illnesses, which can make him or her more susceptible to infection and its complications.'

The immune system naturally gets worse with age, meaning people are less likely to fight off illness so they get sick quicker and stay sick for longer.

There are also people from all over the world who join together on cruises, meaning that seasonal viruses and different strains of illnesses are all mashed together in one place.

Dr Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: 'Cruise ships take passengers and crew from all over the world, often passengers are relatively elderly, they spend most of their time on board indoors mixing with others.'

Dr Kak, from Michigan, added: 'The individuals are often from different cultures, with different immunization backgrounds and health statuses.'

One expert said there were likely to be people on board who had ignored the instructions given to them by crew

The ship will have to have a 'military-style' deep clean before it can be used again after this ordeal, one expert told MailOnline

CONTAMINATED CROCKERY, VENTILATION AND SEWAGE COULD ALL SPREAD THE VIRUS

BRITISH HONEYMOONER RECOVERS FROM CORONAVIRUS Alan Steele, who was on board the Diamond Princess and diagnosed with coronavirus 11 days ago on February 7, today said he has recovered and is expecting to be released from quarantine tomorrow. He is thought to still be in a hospital in Yokohama, after he was forced to leave his new wife, Wendy, behind when he was confirmed to have the illness. In a post on Facebook earlier Mr Steele, 58, from Wolverhampton, joked 'I will need a cruise to get over this'. Alan Steele, pictured with his wife Wendy, was on board the ship and is in hospital after being diagnosed with the coronavirus. He has recovered and expects to be released on Wednesday In a more serious note last night he said: 'Lying here trying to sleep and struggling. So much going through my head. 'One thing was how brilliant and great the crew and staff of the Diamond have been as you have to remember they to are victims of this situation. 'So I know they will be financially rewarded but needed to say on behalf of myself and my wife and I think on behalf of the rest of the passengers bloody well done you are great ambassadors for your company and thank you very much.'

Cruise ship passengers have to drink from the same water supplies and eat food from the same kitchens, meaning that if a virus or bacteria gets into these the consequences could be devastating.

However, the coronavirus is a respiratory infection – meaning it takes hold in the lungs – so this is not considered to be a major contributor to spread on the Diamond Princess.

Dr Whitworth said: '[This is not a worry] for a respiratory virus.

'It's classic for gastrointestinal infections such norovirus but I don't think that would be affecting this situation.'

Diarrhoea and vomiting bugs such as noroviruses and salmonella could spread through food or water but the coronavirus is only known to infect people when it is inhaled.

There remains, however, the possibility that the virus could spread on contaminated crockery or cutlery if it is not cleaned thoroughly with soap and hot water.

Experts have also questioned whether the ventilation or sewage systems could have been implicated in spreading the airborne disease.

One said the virus could be spreading by other means which are not known, and argued the quarantine should have worked but it wasn't well managed.

'Obviously the quarantine hasn't worked, and this ship has now become a source of infection,' said Dr Nathalie MacDermott, an expert at King's College London.

'We need to understand how the quarantine measures on board were implemented, what the air filtration on board is like, how the cabins are connected and how waste products are disposed of.'

'There could also be another mode of transmission we're not familiar with,' she said, noting the possibility of environmental spread and the importance of 'deep-cleaning' the entire ship to prevent people from touching contaminated surfaces.

During the 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS, a related virus, experts discovered that more than 300 people were infected through a defective sewage system in a Hong Kong housing estate.

Dr MacDermott said it was possible there was a similar issue aboard the Diamond Princess, but that a full investigation was needed.

'There's no reason this should not have worked if it had been done properly,' she said.

People on the Diamond Princess have been told they cannot leave the ship until they are tested for the virus by Japanese authorities, removed by their own government or taken to hospital if they're diagnosed

DIAMOND PRINCESS HAS MORE CORONAVIRUS CASES THAN ALL COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF CHINA COMBINED Eighty-eight new cases of coronavirus on the Diamond Princess were announced today, showing the virus continues to spread rapidly. That means more people were confirmed in one day on the ship than during the entire outbreak in any country other than China. The passengers, who come from around the world, are expected to face another two weeks of quarantine once they get off the boat, even if they have a clean bill of health. The virus, named SARS-CoV-2, has infected just over 73,000 people in China and killed 1,868. In the 28 countries and territories affected in the rest of the world, there have been a total of 443 infections and five deaths. On the Diamond Princess there have been 542 infections and no deaths. The global spread of cases looks like this: Singapore - 77

Japan - 66

Hong Kong - 60

Thailand - 35

South Korea - 31

Malaysia, Taiwan - 22 each

Vietnam, Germany - 16 each

Australia, US - 15 each

France - 12

Macau - 10

UK, United Arab Emirates - 9 each

Canada - 8

India, Philippines, Italy - 3 each

Russia, Spain - 2 each

Belgium, Sweden, Finland, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Egypt - 1 each

THE QUARANTINE WAS 'WORTH A TRY' BUT HAS FAILED

Experts now agree that the quarantine on board the Diamond Princess has not worked, but they say it was a good idea and 'worth a try'.

Infectious diseases expert at the US National Institutes of Health, Dr Anthony Fauci, said quarantining the cruise ship had been a good idea at the start but had failed.

He told USA Today : 'The quarantine process failed. I'd like to sugarcoat it and try to be diplomatic about it, but it failed. People were getting infected on that ship.

'Something went awry in the process of the quarantining on that ship. I don't know what it was, but a lot of people got infected on that ship.'

Dr Whitworth told MailOnline: 'I think it was absolutely right to attempt to control [the virus] in this way.

'The primary thing the quarantine was trying to do was stop the infection getting into the general public, which it has done.

'This is an unknown virus and we don't know precisely how to control it. It was worth a go but it's simply not worked.'

Dr Hunter, who said it was disappointing that the quarantine had failed, added: 'It's difficult to enforce a quarantine in a ship environment and I'm absolutely sure there were some passengers who think they're not going to let anyone tell them what they can and cannot do.'

HOW CAN OTHER QUARANTINE ZONES AVOID INTERNAL SPREAD?

Dr Whitworth said people having space to move away from other people is the key to stopping the virus from spreading.

Although it is not always possible – or reasonable – to keep people completely alone in rooms or cells, making sure they are not treading on the toes of others is the most important factor.

And places must be kept clean if they have been visited by people with the coronavirus or those suspected of having it.

In the UK, people are being quarantined in groups of around 100 in apartments or hotel rooms, with access to outdoor space.

Australia is using a former immigration detention centre which has large outdoor grounds around it, and the US is using military bases.

Dr Whitworth said: '[Quarantine should be in] a situation where people can have more space. Distancing is more important. My limited understanding of cruise ships is that they have lots of narrow corridors.'

He added that, once all the crew and passengers were off the Diamond Princess, the company would have to 'do a military-style deep cleaning of the ship... really go to town.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8018667/Government-tells-coronavirus-cruise-passengers-NOT-allowed-evacuation-flight.html
484,"Coronavirus death toll climbs to more than 2,000 with more than 75,000 cases recorded across world","['Sam Blanchard', 'Joe Middleton For Mailonline']","Someone who is infected with the coronavirus can spread it with just a simple cough or a sneeze, scientists say.

Over 2,000 people with the virus are now confirmed to have died and more than 75,000 have been infected. But experts predict the true number of people with the disease could be as high as 350,000 in Wuhan alone, as they warn it may kill as many as two in 100 cases. Here's what we know so far:

What is the coronavirus?

A coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown.

The coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2.

Experts say the bug, which has killed around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named after it.

The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. The virus itself is called SARS-CoV-2.

Dr Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals.

'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses).

'Coronaviruses are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet known.'

The first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31.

By January 8, 59 suspected cases had been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge.

The first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000.

Just a week after that, there had been more than 800 confirmed cases and those same scientists estimated that some 4,000 – possibly 9,700 – were infected in Wuhan alone. By that point, 26 people had died.

By January 27, more than 2,800 people were confirmed to have been infected, 81 had died, and estimates of the total number of cases ranged from 100,000 to 350,000 in Wuhan alone.

By January 29, the number of deaths had risen to 132 and cases were in excess of 6,000.

By February 5, there were more than 24,000 cases and 492 deaths.

By February 11, this had risen to more than 43,000 cases and 1,000 deaths.

A change in the way cases are confirmed on February 13 – doctors decided to start using lung scans as a formal diagnosis, as well as laboratory tests – caused a spike in the number of cases, to more than 60,000 and to 1,369 deaths.

Where does the virus come from?

According to scientists, the virus has almost certainly come from bats. Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals – the similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet cats and camels, respectively.

The first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in the city, which has since been closed down for investigation.

Although the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat.

A study by the Wuhan Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in patients in China is 96 per cent similar to a coronavirus they found in bats.

However, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was.

Dr Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places the origin of nCoV in bats in China.

'We still do not know whether another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host might have been.'

So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it?

Experts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly.

It is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus which infects humans' lungs.

Another reason for concern is that nobody has any immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across often, like the flu or common cold.

Speaking at a briefing in January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them.

'Most seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.'

If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die.

'My feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in.

'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.'

How does the virus spread?

The illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even before someone has symptoms.

It is believed to travel in the saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky.

Originally, people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to person.

There is now evidence that it can spread third hand – to someone from a person who caught it from another person.

What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms?

Once someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms – but they may still be contagious during this time.

If and when they do become ill, typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever (high temperature). The vast majority of patients – at least 97 per cent, based on available data – will recover from these without any issues or medical help.

In a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people.

What have genetic tests revealed about the virus?

Scientists in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of the virus and released them to experts working around the world.

This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause.

Examinations have revealed the coronavirus did not change much – changing is known as mutating – much during the early stages of its spread.

However, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it spread through people.

This means efforts to study the virus and to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus might look different every time scientists analyse it.

More study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed separately.

How dangerous is the virus?

The virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 50million people.

However, experts say the true number of patients is likely considerably higher and therefore the death rate considerably lower. Imperial College London researchers estimate that there were 4,000 (up to 9,700) cases in Wuhan city alone up to January 18 – officially there were only 444 there to that date. If cases are in fact 100 times more common than the official figures, the virus may be far less dangerous than currently believed, but also far more widespread.

Experts say it is likely only the most seriously ill patients are seeking help and are therefore recorded – the vast majority will have only mild, cold-like symptoms. For those whose conditions do become more severe, there is a risk of developing pneumonia which can destroy the lungs and kill you.

Can the virus be cured?

The COVID-19 virus cannot currently be cured and it is proving difficult to contain.

Antibiotics do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge amounts of money.

No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this outbreak, for similar reasons to the above.

The National Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But this may take a year or more to develop, according to Pharmaceutical Technology.

Currently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people.

People who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public.

And airports around the world are putting in place screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature).

However, it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport.

Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic?

The outbreak is an epidemic, which is when a disease takes hold of one community such as a country or region.

Although it has spread to dozens of countries, the outbreak is not yet classed as a pandemic, which is defined by the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new disease'.

The head of WHO's global infectious hazard preparedness, Dr Sylvie Briand, said: 'Currently we are not in a pandemic. We are at the phase where it is an epidemic with multiple foci, and we try to extinguish the transmission in each of these foci,' the Guardian reported.

She said that most cases outside of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't actually spreading actively around the world.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8018797/Coronavirus-death-toll-climbs-2-000-75-000-cases-recorded-world.html
485,Russia to ban entry of Chinese nationals to halt virus,"['Chris Dyer', 'Chris Dyer For Mailonline', 'Associated Press']","Russia today said it will ban all Chinese citizens from entering the country due to the virus outbreak centred in China that has infected more than 73,000 people worldwide.

The temporary entry ban comes into effect from Thursday at midnight Moscow time for an indefinite period, according to a decree signed by Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.

The Kremlin said it took the move due to the 'worsening epidemiological situation' in China.

Russia has taken drastic measures to stop the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak which has claimed nearly 1,900 lives in China and around the world.

It has already closed its 2,650-mile border with China and Mongolia as well as imposing other travel restrictions.

There have been no more coronavirus cases in Russia since two women, who returned from China recently, were treated and released from hospital.

Chinese nationals visit Russia as tourists or live there for work or study and many transit through Russian airports en route to the West.

Deputy Prime Minister in charge of health, Tatiana Golikova, said: 'The entry of all Chinese citizens via Russia's state frontiers will be suspended from February 20 for work travel, private travel, study and tourism.'

She added that the decision was taken 'because of the worsening of the epidemic in China and the fact that Chinese nationals are continuing to arrive on Russian territory'.

The new entry ban will not affect travellers who need to transfer flights at Russian airports, authorities said.

Apart from the two Chinese citizens in Russian who were treated and released, a Russian national was also infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship now quarantined in Japan.

However, Russian authorities have taken significant steps to try to keep the virus from spreading, including hospitalising hundreds of people as a precaution after they returned from China.

Russia halted most air traffic to China, suspended all trains to China and North Korea, and temporarily stopped issuing work visas to Chinese citizens. Chinese students studying in Russia were told not to return until March 1.

Earlier this month, the prime minister said Russia might start deporting the foreigners infected with the virus.

Alla llyina was admitted to the hospital in St Petersburg on February 6 with a sore throat and was tested for the strain, officially named Covid-19 by the World Health Organisation, because she had returned from China five days earlier.

She broke out of the hospital the next day by disabling an electronic lock in her room after finding out she would have to spend 14 days in isolation instead of the 24 hours that doctors promised her.

In an Instagram post, Ilyina said doctors told her that she tested negative for the virus but still had to remain quarantined for two weeks.

In the meantime, Germany is sending a second shipment of medical aid supplies to China to help the Asian giant fight the coronavirus epidemic.

German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the government would send 8.7 tons of aid supplies worth $162,000 (€150,000), including protection gear and disinfectants.

'Germany stands firmly on the side of China in the battle against coronavirus and works closely and trustfully with the Chinese officials,' Maas said. 'We have the utmost respect for the efforts China has already undertaken.'

The virus, which emerged in central China in December, has killed 1,868 patients in mainland China and five others elsewhere. The World Health Organization has named the illness COVID-19.

Ilyina, who escaped from a hospital in St. Petersburg, where she was being kept in isolation for possible inflection by the new coronavirus, was ordered by court on Monday to return back to the quarantine for at least two days

China has instituted a strict lockdown on over 60 million people in central Hubei province and other nations are taking their own measures - including mandatory 14-day quarantines - to stop the virus from getting established on their territory.

Europe has had one virus death among its 47 confirmed cases, an 80-year-old Chinese tourist in Paris who was initially turned away by two French hospitals.

Italy says 14 of 25 Italian crew members aboard the troubled Diamond Princess cruise ship, which has been struck under quarantine in Japan, will take an Italian evacuation military flight home.

The other 11, including the captain of the ship, will stay, the Italian Foreign Ministry said. No date for the Italian air force plane's departure for Japan has been decided yet.

The Russian Embassy in Japan announced Tuesday that one Russian was among the 542 people on the Diamond Princess confirmed with the virus. The statement clarified earlier reports about two Russians getting infected.

On Monday, a Russian court sent a woman who broke out of a locked hospital during a 14-day isolation period back into quarantine. Russian health authorities are suing others who have defied quarantine requirements.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8016463/Germany-sends-medical-aid-China-fight-virus.html
486,350 Americans from quarantine stations in California are released,"['Mary Kekatos Senior', 'Mary Kekatos Senior Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com']","Nearly 350 Americans evacuated from China amid the coronavirus outbreak were released from two separate quarantine stations in California on Tuesday.

The first group had been in isolation at Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield and the second was at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego.

All of the US citizens had been evacuated from Wuhan in the province Hubei, the epicenter from the outbreak, where all but five of the 2,007 coronavirus deaths have occurred.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a statement that evacuees have 'been medically cleared,' of the virus that's struck more than 75,000 people worldwide and said they 'pose no health risk' to their respective communities.

The health agency noted that a new group of evacuees arrived at Travis Air Force Base on Sunday after having been rescued from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan.

But officials stressed the new group has been kept separate from other quarantined groups.

A group of 180 evacuees were released from their quarantine at Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, California on Tuesday. Pictured: Yanjun Wei (second from left) and her two young children were reunited with her husband Ken (second from right) after being under quarantine

On the same day, about 165 evacuees were freed from quarantine at Miramar Marine Air Corps Station in San Diego. Pictured: Evacuees at Miramar throw masks in the air in celebration

'CDC extends its thanks to these individuals for their cooperation and patience during their quarantine and wish them well as they return to home, work, and school,' a statement from the health agency read.

'CDC also thanks the men and women on both bases and their families for their graciousness while holding these guests.'

The 180 evacuees at Travis Air Force Base have been living at the Westwind Inn on base since arriving two weeks ago.

Buses arrived on Tuesday morning taking evacuees to either Sacramento International Airport or San Francisco International Airport.

Among them were Yanjun Wei and her two young children, Mia and Ronan, who were evacuated to the US after visiting family in Wuhan.

They were greeted by Wei's husband and the children's father, Ken Burnett, who flew from their San Diego home to Sacramento Airport.

'I've been waiting for this day,' Wei told KCRA 3 News.

At Miramar Station, coach buses were seen arriving to transport the nearly 165 evacuees, although to where was not immediately clear.

One of the Americans, Yu Lin, posted several photos on Twitter celebrating the end of her quarantine.

In one photo, she showed tags meaning she passed her final health screening. In another, she and her fellow evacuees tossed their face masks in the air in celebration.

'Lots of people asked me how I feel, I can only recognize my feeling now,' Lin wrote on Tuesday morning.

'It is like graduation. Bittersweet, happy, nervous, grateful, leaving friends, leaving people who cared for us, maybe a little tears…just no hugs.'

The release of the two groups comes about one week after the first group of 195 American were able to leave March Air Reserve Base at the end of their quarantine period.

At the time, officials urged the public not to shun them, or the workers who helped them, after both groups faced discrimination.

487,First coronavirus patient had NO connection to Wuhan seafood market,"['Billie Thomson', 'Billie Thomson For Mailonline']","The first patient diagnosed with the novel coronavirus has been reported to be a bed-bound pensioner who had no connection to a food market in Wuhan where Beijing's officials say the outbreak began.

The revelation, made by BBC, echoed with the information disclosed in a previous medical research, which has prompted Chinese people to speculate about the possible alternative sources of the deadly disease.

Over the weekend, a mysterious virus lab became the centre point of Chinese social media after online accounts suggested that the lethal virus had come from there - allegations the state-run institute has denied and branded as rumours.

Beijing's experts claim that the deadly coronavirus outbreak began at Huanan Seafood Wholesales Market in Wuhan. They believe the virus was passed onto humans through wildlife sold as food.

The first coronavirus patient has been revealed to be a bed-bound pensioner who had no connection to a food market in Wuhan where Beijing's officials say the outbreak began. In the file photo above, a medical worker looks after a patient at a hospital in Wuhan on January 24

The 'patient zero' fell ill on December 1 - a week earlier than the date the Chinese officials said the first case emerged - and had not been to the marketplace in question, a study also revealed

The virus, formally known as COVID-19, has killed at least 1,873 people and infected more than 73,330 worldwide since it emerged in Wuhan late last year.

According to public notices released by Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, the first coronavirus patient appeared on December 8 and most of the initial patients were linked to the seafood market.

But BBC reported that the very first sufferer, also known as the 'patient zero', was a pensioner in his 70s who was bed-bound due to a stroke and suffered from dementia.

The unnamed man fell ill on December 1 - a week earlier than officials' claims - and had not been to the seafood market prior to falling ill, a doctor told BBC.

Prof Wu Wenjuan, a director at intensive care units of Wuhan's Jinyintan Hospital, told the news outlet yesterday that the pensioner had had to stay at home due to his health condition and had no connection with Huanan.

A previous study published on peer-reviewed medical journal The Lancet revealed that three out of the first four coronavirus patients had no connection to the seafood market in Wuhan

The deadly Chinese coronavirus outbreak began at the Huanan Seafood Wholesales Market in Wuhan (pictured), Chinese experts confirmed after testing samples collected from the place

Scientists from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said tests proved humans caught it from animals at the market where customers chose from live animals that were slaughtered in front of them (picture purportedly shows skinned chicks at the market)

Last week experts suggested the disease may have originated in snakes, which are known carriers of coronaviruses (multiple reptiles at the market)

Image shows what appears to be a beaver and a small deer caged at Huanan

Prof Wu is among a group of experts who last month published a bombshell study on peer-reviewed medical journal The Lancet, revealing critical information that had never been released by the Chinese government.

'The symptom onset date of the first patient identified was Dec 1, 2019. None of his family members developed fever or any respiratory symptoms,' the report said.

The team surveyed the first 41 coronavirus patients who fell ill between December 1 and January 2 and discovered that 14 out of the 41 patients were not linked to the market.

Notably, among the first four cases treated between December 1 and December 11, only one of them had connection to the market.

Chinese health officials have not publicly commented on the study.

Ninety-nine per cent of cases have been in China, where tens of millions of residents are in lockdown to contain the escalating crisis. The COVID-19 virus has killed at least 1,873 people

More than 73,000 patients have been infected, including nearly 1,000 outside of China

Almost 1,900 people have now died from the killer coronavirus rapidly sweeping the world

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is 'working to organise' a flight back to the UK for British nationals on board the Diamond Princess, which is isolated off the coast of Japan

Daniel Lucey, an infectious disease specialist at Georgetown University, said it was possible that the virus spread silently between residents of Wuhan as early as November - if not earlier - before the cluster of cases from the Huanan market was discovered in late December.

'The virus came into that marketplace before it came out of that marketplace,' Lucey told Science last month.

'Now It seems clear that [the] seafood market is not the only origin of the virus,' he wrote. 'But to be honest, we still do not know where the virus came from now.'

A number of conspiracy theories have connected the novel coronavirus to Wuhan Institute of Virology.

One school of theories claim that the virus had been leaked from the lab either by accident or on purpose.

Wuhan Institute of Virology (pictured) has been the centre of conspiracy theories after the coronavirus epidemic started. One theory claims that the virus was a biological weapon engineered by China and was leaked from the lab by accident - to which China denied

On Saturday, the institute became a trending topic on China's Twitter-like Weibo after accounts claimed that one of its graduates was the 'patient zero'.

Sources alleged that a woman named Huang Yanling, who received her master's degree from the academy in 2015, was the first to be infected with the virus.

Wuhan Institute of Virology denied the claims. In a statement, it said Huang had been working in another province and never been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus.

A day later, a Weibo user, who claimed to be a researcher at the institute named Chen Quanjiao, accused the institute's director Wang Yanyi of leaking the virus.

The institute said the allegation was fabricated and that the web user had posed as Chen. Police stressed that the blogger was based outside of China.

Shi Zhengli, a director at Wuhan Institute of Virology, said earlier this month: 'The 2019 novel coronavirus is nature's punishment for humans' uncivilised life habits. I, Shi Zhengli, use my life to guarantee, [the virus] has no relation with the lab.'

Shi urged the Chinese authorities to launch an official investigation into the matter.

She told Chinese news outlet Caixin: 'Conspiracy theorists don't believe in science. I hope our country's professional departments can come to investigate and prove our innocence.'

Last week, a team of Chinese scientists claimed that the deadly coronavirus might have started life in a research facility just 900 feet from the Wuhan fish market.

Experts from South China University of Technology said in a paper that the Wuhan Center for Disease Control (WHCDC) could have spawned the contagion.

'The possible origins of 2019-nCoV coronavirus,' penned by scholars Xiao Botao and Xiao Lei claims the WHCDC kept disease-ridden animals in laboratories, including 605 bats.

The paper also mentioned that bats - which are linked to coronavirus - once attacked a researcher and 'blood of bat was on his skin.'

It said: 'Genome sequences from patients were 96% or 89% identical to the Bat CoV ZC45 coronavirus originally found in Rhinolophus affinis (intermediate horseshoe bat).'

It described how the only native bats are found around 600 miles away from the Wuhan seafood market and that the probability of bats flying from Yunnan and Zhejiang provinces was minimal.

488,India is hastily building a brick WALL to block Donald Trump's view of the slums,"['Andrew Court', 'Emily Goodin', 'Senior U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com']","Advertisement

Donald Trump is heading to India next week, and the country is hastily building a wall that critics claim is designed to shield the President from seeing the nation's infamous slums.

The Commander-in-chief and First Lady Melania Trump will be greeted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi when they land in Ahmedabad on Monday.

The pair will then journey from the airport to the under-construction Motera Stadium - which is set to become the world's largest cricket arena upon completion.

A 1,640-foot brick wall has been quickly erected close to the stadium ahead of Trump's visit, with some saying it is being built to block the view of a slum area inhabited by more than 2,000 people.

It will shield the President as he arrives at the stadium to attend an event called 'Namaste Trump,' which translates to 'Greetings, Trump.'

Indian senior government official Bijal Patel told the Associated Press the wall was built 'for security reasons' and not to conceal the slum.

'Apart from security reasons, the wall is also part of a beautification and cleanliness drive,' she said

Donald Trump is set to touch down in India next Tuesday, and claims 7 million people will be on hand to greet him

In a press conference on Tuesday, President Trump said he was excited about the visit.

'We are not treated very well by India, but I happen to like the prime minister a lot,' the president said.

'He told me we will have 7 million people between the airport and the event. The stadium, I understand, is going semi-under construction, but it is going to be the largest stadium in the world. It's going to be very exciting, but he says between the stadium and the airport, we will have about 7 million people. It's going to be very exciting,' Trump said.

American-Indian relations have been strained by trade disputes, which the president said he hopes to have worked out by November's election.

1,640-foot brick wall has been quickly erected close to the stadium. Workers are seen constructing the wall last Thursday

Trump, along with Melania Trump, will make his first visit to India next week where he will inaugurate the stadium, which has been undergoing construction.

The event will take place in Modi's home base, which Trump is visiting at the prime minister's invitation.

Tensions between the U.S. and India have increased since Trump levied tariffs on steel and aluminium from India.

India responded with higher tariffs on agricultural goods and restrictions on U.S. medical devices.

The Trump administration retaliated by removing India from a decades-old preferential trade program.

'We could have a trade deal with India, but I'm really saving the big deal for later on. We're doing a very big trade deal with India. We will have it,' Trump said Tuesday. 'I don't know it will be done before the election, but we will have a very big deal with India.'

489,Ben Affleck's 'biggest regret' is divorce from Jennifer Garner,"['Adam S. Levy', 'Adam S. Levy For Dailymail.Com']","Ben Affleck called his divorce from Jennifer Garner his 'biggest regret' in a candid new interview which explored his struggle with alcoholism, and the devastating impact his addiction had on his marriage and career.

In an interview with the New York Times, which was published on Tuesday, the 47-year-old actor opened up about the pain he felt amid the breakdown of his marriage to Garner, 47, with the pair announcing their separation in June 2015.

'The biggest regret of my life is this divorce,' he told the publication. 'Shame is really toxic. There is no positive byproduct of shame. It's just stewing in a toxic, hideous feeling of low self-worth and self-loathing.'

Biggest regret: Ben Affleck admitted that divorcing Jennifer Garner was the biggest regret of his life in a new interview with the New York Times. Pictured together in March 2014

Affleck spoke about his battles while plugging his new film The Way Back, in which he plays Jack Cunningham, a high school basketball coach fighting alcoholism.

The father-of-three – to daughters Violet, 14, and Seraphina, 11, and son Samuel, seven – said he 'drank relatively normally for a long time' in the wake of their split.

'What happened was that I started drinking more and more when my marriage was falling apart,' he told the newspaper. 'This was 2015, 2016. My drinking, of course, created more marital problems.'

Opening up: The candid interview explored his struggle with alcoholism, and the devastating impact his addiction had on his marriage and career

The Argo star would go on to enter a rehabilitation facility for alcohol addiction in August of 2018, saying, 'I am fighting for myself and my family,' in a social media post two months later about his efforts to remain sober.

He suffered a slip this past fall when he was snapped outside of Unicef's Masquerade ball at the La Peer Hotel in West Hollywood, California, appearing inebriated, using nearby vehicles to stay upright in a clip posted on TMZ.

In visiting Garner's home the following day last October, Affleck told the outlet he'd do his best to move forward from the mistake, saying: 'It happens, you slip, and I'm not gonna let it derail me.'

He has been persistent in his efforts to battle alcohol addiction with multiple stints in rehab over the past 20 years. He spent 30 days in rehab at Promises in Malibu in July of 2001, with Charlie Sheen personally taking him there, People reported.

Poignant: In his new film The Way Back, Affleck plays Jack Cunningham, a high school basketball coach fighting alcoholism

Speaking with The Hollywood Reporter in 2012 about the stint, he said, 'I went to rehab for being 29 and partying too much and not having a lot of boundaries and to clear my head and try to get some idea of who I wanted to be ... it was more a ""let me get myself straight"" before it became a rite of passage.'

Following his 2004 wedding to Garner, there were no reported stints of rehab for Affleck until March of 2017, when he said that he underwent 40 days in rehab in an effort to be 'the best father' he can be.

'I want my kids to know there is no shame in getting help when you need it, and to be a source of strength for anyone out there who needs help but is afraid to take the first step,' he said in a Facebook post about it at the time.

'I'm lucky to have the love of my family and friends, including my co-parent, Jen, who has supported me and cared for our kids as I've done the work I set out to do. This was the first of many steps being taken towards a positive recovery.'

Cordial: Affleck and Jennifer Garner were seen with their children in Los Angeles in December. The pair have remained on good terms since their breakup in 2015

Doting dad: Ben held hands with Samuel and walked with his mother in the December outing

He would re-enter rehab the following year, in August of 2018, with Garner taking him there personally.

In an interview with Vanity Fair back in 2016, Garner said of her union to Affleck: 'It was a real marriage. It wasn’t for the cameras. And it was a huge priority for me to stay in it. And that did not work.'

Speaking to CBS in 2018, she said that the hardest part of the breakup wasn't the attention it received, but rather the tough experience itself.

'Everybody says, ""Oh, you've had to go through this in public"" – the public isn't what's hard,' she said. 'What's hard is going through it.'

Elsewhere in his New York Times interview, Affleck said that the drinking issues played a part in his announcement he would stop playing Batman early last year.

Devoted: Jen was seen with daughters Violet, 14, and Seraphina, 11, on the December outing

The star revealed that he 'showed somebody The Batman script' and was told in response: 'I think the script is good. I also think you'll drink yourself to death if you go through what you just went through again.'

He told the paper that he keeps a positive mindset in moving forward amid life's ups and downs.

'It's not particularly healthy for me to obsess over the failures – the relapses – and beat myself up,' he said.

'I have certainly made mistakes. I have certainly done things that I regret. But you've got to pick yourself up, learn from it, learn some more, try to move forward.'

In recent years, the star of films such as Argo, Justice League and Armageddon has been in romances with Lindsay Shookus, a 39-year-old producer for Saturday Night Live; and Shauna Sexton, a 24-year-old model who's been seen in Playboy.

Moving forward: Ben said that he decided to bow out of The Batman after a friend advised he would drink himself to death if things got complicated with the film

Affleck also opened up to the paper about why he lied to Extra's Mario Lopez in 2016 about getting a large tattoo on his back of a Phoenix, claiming it was 'fake for a movie'.

He added to Lopez at the time: 'I actually do have a number of tattoos… but I try to have them in places where you don’t have to do a lot of cover up.'

Speaking with the paper about the fib in his newly unveiled interview, Affleck said: 'I guess I got a kick out of messing with Extra... I resented that somebody got a picture of it by spying on me. It felt invasive.

'But you’re right. I could have said, ""That’s none of your business."" Is your tattoo real or not real? Of course it’s real! No, I put a fake tattoo on my back and then hid it.'

The Way Back is scheduled to be released in the US March 6, with an April 24 unveiling set for April 24.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8018139/Ben-Afflecks-biggest-regret-divorce-Jennifer-Garner.html
490,Hayden Panettiere's boyfriend Brian Hickerson is arrested again for domestic violence,"['Sarah Sotoodeh', 'Tracy Wright For Dailymail.Com']","Hayden Panettiere's boyfriend Brian Hickerson was arrested on Friday around 2:30am after allegedly punching her face with a closed fist during a fight on Valentine's Day.

Brian was booked for domestic battery and a second charge of interfering with a police officer, after he allegedly would not identify himself to authorities, according to TMZ.

The incident comes just nine months after he was arrested for domestic violence following a drunken argument with Hayden, 30, at 2am in May.

Mug shot: Hayden Panettiere's boyfriend Brian Hickerson was arrested in Wyoming on Valentine's Day after allegedly striking her in the face during a fight

The Nashville star's boyfriend was found by cops from the Teton County Sheriff's office on the driveway in Jackson Hole, Wyoming after someone called the police to report it.

The caller was reported to have said that there was an 'intoxicated male' that was 'locked out of the home' because 'he punched his girlfriend in the face,' according to the outlet.

Brian allegedly 'struck' the Hayden 'with a closed fist on the right side of her face' during their fight in their bedroom, where he also 'threw' her around.

Police noted that she had a 'red and swollen face' and 'a scrape and swelling on her left hand' which she believed came from his watch during their fight.

Throwback: Brian was booked for domestic battery and a second charge of interfering with a police office, after he allegedly would not identify himself to cops, according to TMZ; seen January 31, 2019 with Brian in LA

When authorities arrived on the scene, Brian was in the driveway and he allegedly told them that Hayden was inside the home 'saying he beat the f**k out of me.'

He said that he hired a private chef to stay around that night so he 'wouldn't be accused of bulls**t' while avoiding their question on whether or not he punched the star.

The police called the chef, who left their residence a little after 1 am (1.5 hours before he was arrested) and said he saw the couple arguing earlier in the evening.

The couple first began dating in August 2018 after she was spotted walking barefoot out of a restaurant with Brian by her side.

Prior to their outing, it was believed that Hayden was still with her then-fiance Wladimir Klitschko, who she shares five-year-old daughter Kaya.

The little one has been living with Wladimir, 43, in his home country of Ukraine and Hayden reportedly travels often to see her.

Mom: Hayden and ex fiance Wladimir Klitschko have a five-year-old daughter named Kaya; she lives with Wladimir in his home country of Ukraine and Hayden reportedly travels often to see her. Pictured holding her daughter in a snap she shared June 3, 2017 to Twitter

It had been reported in 2019 that Hayden hadn't 'had much time with her daughter'.

'She really hasn't had much time with her daughter,' a source told Us Weekly. 'She knows the child being with her is not best for [Kaya right now]. It's a sad situation.'

Hayden's mom Lesley Vogel said in 2018 that her daughter does visit Kaya in Europe while Wlad 'travels a great deal' to keep some normalcy for their little girl.

'It's heartbreaking and challenging,' an insider said. 'They didn't spend the holidays together. It's disturbing, and she'll have to figure out how to manage this. It's not an easy scenario.'

Hayden's lawyer revealed the actress still 'regularly' sees her daughter, People reported in July 2019.

Their debut: The incident comes just nine months after he was arrested for domestic violence following a drunken argument with Hayden at 2 am in May; pictured August 2, 2018, which is the first time they were seen together

Hayden and Wladimir were in a relationship from 2009 until they split in May 2011; they reunited in April 2013 and got engaged in October of that same year.

In December 2014, the duo welcomed daughter Kaya; she revealed on Live With Kelly and Michael in September 2015 that she experienced postpartum depression.

One month later, Hayden voluntarily checked herself into a facility for postpartum depression and for a second time in May 2016.

Soon after Hayden was seen leaving Craig's with Brian while barefoot, her mom confirmed she split from Wladimir, who is a Ukrainian former professional boxer.

Though their relationship was over, they remained friends.

'We're still respectful of each other, and we still have that friendship with each other,' Hayden told Us in February 2019. 'It's not a situation that you find yourself in all that often, so it's a new one. But I think we've done a really good job.'

In October 2018 - just two months after they were first seen together - Brian allegedly assaulted his father David with Hayden present, according to TMZ.

The incident occurred in South Carolina at a home; cops responded to a call for assault and battery.

The way they were: Prior to their outing, it was believed that Hayden was still with her then-fiance Wladimir Klitschko, who she shares five-year-old daughter Kaya; pictured December 7, 2013 at A Heart for Children Charity Gala in Berlin, Germany

Another domestic violence call was placed on May 2, 2019; He was arrested for domestic violence after a drunken argument with the actress turned physical at 2 am in LA, TMZ reported.

Police reportedly discovered 'redness and marks' on Hayden's body; after he was book for felony domestic violence, he was released after posting a $50,000 bond.

The felony complaint said that he 'willfully inflicted corporal injury resulting in a traumatic condition upon Hayden P.'

He was later charged with one count of felony domestic violence on May 23, 2019 and pleaded not guilty to the charge, which could have seen up to four years in prison; the case was dismissed in September 2019.

'Our office was unable to proceed because we could not secure a material witness. The protective order also was dismissed,' a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said.

In a weird twist of events, Hayden was spotted holding hands with Brian's brother Zach in September while out and about in New York.

A source told People at the time that the display had nothing to do with affection: 'Hayden and Zach are friends and have been for a while.'

Hayden's family still doesn't 'approve of the relationship' due to many past aggressions.

'They are not fans of Brian,' a source told People magazine. 'It's clear that he has issues of his own, not to mention the anger issues, which is obviously a big one.'

At the time, Hayden's attorney Andrew Brettler told the publication: 'Hayden is a strong, intelligent woman who is capable of making her own decisions.'

They were last seen together in November 2019 while walking through LAX airport together.

Career: Hayden's last role was in the hit series Nashville, which ended its six year run in 2018

The TV star had told TMZ at the time that 'Everything's always been OK,' despite his arrest under suspension of domestic violence in May.

Defending herself against critics accusing her of being in a toxic relationship, the actress said: 'My family knows I'm smart enough to make my own decisions and thank you for being concerned, but I am A-Okay.' She also assured people that everything was fine between her and her family.

In December, Hayden returned to social media following a 10 month from debuting her new pixie cut; she said: 'Channeling my inner #Kirby #Scream4 Thanks to my boys @anthonyleonard.'

The message referenced her character Kirby Reed from the 2011 slasher film Scream 4, who rocked a similar haircut.

'Hayden was looking for a radical change, so last night we just went for it! It's a modern version of a classic pixie style with a little more of an edge,' hair dresser Leonard Zagami, who did the cut, told E! News in December.

'The color is silver, but not grey. She had previously been going with a super sexy blonde,' she added.

Earlier this month, Hayden posted another image to her Twitter showing off another hair change - this time blonde locks and an edgy hair cut.

Hayden rose to fame playing cheerleader Claire Bennet in the hit sci-fi series, Heroes.

More recently, she played country singer Juliette Barnes in Nashville.

491,Donald Trump commutes Rod Blagojevich's sentence and pardons Bernie Kerik,"['Emily Goodin', 'Senior U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com']","Donald Trump used his presidential power Tuesday to commute the sentence of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich and issue a trio of pardons: to former New York City Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik, 1980s junk bond king Michael Milken and former San Francisco 49ers owner Edward DeBartolo Jr.

The moves led to speculation more pardons may be in the works, particularly for those Trump associates - such as Roger Stone or Michael Flynn - who got caught and convicted in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.

Trump didn't confirm or deny more pardons were in the works but did defend his actions Tuesday, slamming the sentences of the white-collar criminals as harsh and unfair.

Donald Trump issued a series of pardons and commutations on Tuesday

Trump commuted the sentence of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich (upper left) and issue a trio of pardons: to former New York City Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik (upper right), 1980s junk bond king Michael Milken (lower left) and former San Francisco 49ers owner Edward DeBartolo Jr (lower right)

‘Yes, we have commuted the sentence, he served eight years in jail, a long time,’ Trump told reporters about Blagojevich during a Q&A session at Joint Base Andrews before he left for a four-day trip to the West Coast.

‘I don't know him very well, I've might've met him a couple of times,’ Trump added. ‘He was on for a short while on “The Apprentice” years ago. Seem like a nice person, don't know him, but he served eight years in jail, it was a long time he had to go, many people disagree with the sentences. He's a Democrat, he's not a Republican.’

He added: ‘He will be able to go back home with his family after serving eight years in jail. That was a tremendously powerful ridiculous sentence in my opinion. And in the opinions of many others.’

The commutation means Blagojevich is freed from prison but doesn't have his conviction wiped from his record. Republicans had asked the president not to pardon the former governor, pointing to his corruption record.

Blagojevich, 63, was sent to prison for 14 years for soliciting bribes, including those for the Senate seat once held by Barack Obama, and for trying to shake down a children's hospital.

In 2009, Blagojevich appeared on NBC's 'The Apprentice,' the reality TV show then hosted by Trump.

The president also voiced his support for Kerik, a close friend of his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, and Milken, who became the face of insider trading during the 1980s.

President Trump called Kerik ‘a man who has had many recommendations from a lot of good people.’

Kerik, 64, served just over three years in prison for tax fraud and lying to the White House while being interviewed to be Homeland Security secretary for then-President George W. Bush.

He was appointed police commissioner by Giuliani and served in the position during the September 11th terrorist attacks.

Trump, for his part, praised Milken’s work on cancer research, saying he 'has gone around and done an incredible job for the world with all of his research on cancer.'

The president added: ‘He suffered greatly, he paid a big price, he's done an incredible job.’

Milken survived prostate cancer and co-founded the Milken Family Foundation and is chairman of the Milken Institute - the charities fund research into melanoma, cancer and other life-threatening diseases.

Milken, 73, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for his crimes while heading the bond department at the investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert, and fined $600 million. His sentence was later reduced to two years after he cooperated with federal authorities.

Michael Douglas' unscrupulous character Gordon Gekko in the film Wall Street was at least partially based on Milken.

Supporters of Milken’s pardon included Giuliani, as well as New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.

Ironically, it was Giuliani who charged Milken with 98 counts of racketeering and fraud under the RICO act in 1989.

President Trump also pardoned Ariel Friedler, a technology businessman who pleaded guilty to accessing a computer without authorization; Paul Pogue, a construction company owner who underpaid taxes; David Safavian, who was convicted of obstructing an investigation into a trip he took while he was a senior government official; and Angela Stanton, an author who served a six-month home sentence for her role in a stolen vehicle ring.

President Trump said he relies on recommendations when making his decisions on who to pardon.

‘These are all people that you have to see the recommendations. I am reliant recommendations,’ Trump said.

The rash of pardoning has led to rampant speculation the president may pardon his longtime friend and former campaign aide Roger Stone.

Stone was convicted on seven counts, including witness tampering and lying to investigators, as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.

Trump called the case against Stone 'tainted' in a tweet on Tuesday morning but the judge in his case denied a motion by Stone's lawyers for a retrial.

‘I haven't given it any thought,’ the president said Tuesday when asked if he would pardon Stone. ‘I think he's been treated very unfairly.’

He also said he thought is former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was being treated unfairly. Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI in relation to Mueller's investigation.

‘I think Roger Stone has been treated unfairly. I think General Flynn has been treated very unfairly. I think a lot of people have been treated very unfairly,’ Trump said.

‘You will see what happens,’ he added.

The news follows Trump's decision to pardon former San Francisco 49ers owner Edward DeBartolo Jr., which he had his deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley announce in the presence of several former NFL players - including Jim Brown, Jerry Rice, Charles Haley, and Ronnie Lott.

Gidley and the players left the West Wing Tuesday morning to announce the president's decision in front of the White House.

The players praised the decision to pardon him.

'I take my hat off to Donald Trump for what he did,' Rice said.

Pastor Darrell Scott, former NFL player Jim Brown, and White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley step out of the West Wing after speaking to President Trump about DeBartolo

The pardons amid speculation Trump will pardon Roger Stone

Brown called DeBartolo a 'great man.'

DeBartolo paid $400,000 to former La. Gov. Edwin Edwards to help win a riverboat casino license in 1998.

He pled guilty to the charge of failing to report a felony, and received a $1 million fine and two years of probation. And he was suspended for a year by the NFL.

The son of a prominent real estate development family, DeBartolo owned the 49ers for 23 years and won five Super Bowls as their owner. He stepped down as owner in 1997 after two Louisiana newspapers reported he would be indicted for gambling fraud.

In 1992, DeBartolo was accused of sexual assault by a cocktail waitress he met at a local bar in California. He denied any wrongdoing and was never charged but reportedly paid $200,000 to settle the case out of court.

Rice, who as a wide receiver won three Super Bowls with the 49ers, praised DeBartolo's ownership of the team.

'It was all about family. That's really what they stood for. And that's the reason why I think we won so many championships,' Rice said.

'Eddie was like that 12th man that was on that football field. You know that this guy, you know, he wanted us to win. And I think he's the main reason why we won so many Super Bowls. So today is a great day for him. I'm glad to be here and be a part of that. And, you know, it's just something I'll never forget. You know, this man, he has done so much in the community, he has done so much in NFL football,' he noted.

Former NFL football player Jerry Rice praised Trump's decision

Former NFL football player Jim Brown is a long time Trump supporter

Jim Brown, who praised Trump's decision, is a long time supporter of the president who co-hosted an inauguration party after Trump won the 2016 election.

DeBartolo co-hosted that event with Brown, which honored those close to the president, including Michael Cohen, Trump's then personal attorney who later went to prison for campaign finance violations and tax fraud, and and Omarosa Manigault Newman, the 'Apprentice' contestant turned White House aide who was later fired from that position.

The former fullback for the Cleveland, Brown was also at the White House in October 2018 when Trump met with rapper Kayne West in the Oval Office.

Trump, meanwhile, used his pardon power for DeBartolo as speculation has mounted he may do the same for his longtime friend and former campaign aide Roger Stone.

Stone was convicted on seven counts, including witness tampering and lying to investigators, as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.

492,Nazi Josef Mengele's choice 'specimen' was a 12-year-old boy's head he planned to dissect at his lab,"['Caroline Howe', 'Caroline Howe For Dailymail.Com']","Josef Mengele was the embodiment of evil, prowling the concentration camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau in the 1940s for his helpless victims, with the Nazi being obsessed with anomalies and carried out the most sadistic experiments on those prisoners, a new book reveals.

Known as the Angel of Death and the most notorious war criminal of all time, Mengele was a medical monster and intent on destroying the perceived enemies of the Aryan race – the Jews – and creating the ideal German community.

Captivated by oddities, victims of Mengele's medical experiments were chosen based on different eye colors, growth anomalies such as a clubfoot or a hunchback, giantism or dwarfism, twins and gypsies.

A choice 'specimen' he sent to his lab for study was the head of a 12-year-old boy he was going to dissect.

This detail was discovered in a document by author David Marwell, former chief of investigative research at the Department of Justice's Office of Special Investigations, hired to do a global search to find Mengele in the 1980s.

'This only reinforced my notion of him as a wildly sadistic, grotesque monster,' writes Marwell in his new book Mengele, Unmasking The 'Angel of Death'.

Josef Mengele (pictured in 1942) was the embodiment of evil, prowling the concentration camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau in the 1940s for his helpless victims with the Nazi being obsessed with anomalies and carrying out the most sadistic experiments on them, a new book reveals

Obsessed with anomalies, victims of Mengele's medical experiments were chosen based on eye color, growth oddities such as a clubfoot or a hunchback, giantism or dwarfism, twins and gypsies. The Ovitz family (pictured) were subjected to gruesome experiments at his hands due to their dwarfism. Pictured l-r: Rosika, Franzisca, Avraham, Markus, Frida, Elizabeth and Pualina

Mengele took his turn on the ramp where the starved and exhausted prisoners arrived at the camp in trains or cattle cars. Mengele decided who was going to be a victim of his medical experiments. Pictured: Prisoners arriving to Auschwitz

'Mengele stalked the nightmares and haunted the daydreams of legions and emerged as the embodiment not only of the Holocaust itself but also of the failure of justice in the wake of the war that allowed so many Nazi murderers and accomplices to escape justice,' Marwell adds.

Mengele focused on identical twins, physical twins and gypsies.

With 732 pairs of twins to experiment on, Mengele once impregnated one twin with the sperm from a different twin to see if she would produce twins.

When there was only one baby, one survivor claimed he tore the baby out of the mother's uterus and threw the child into an oven and walked away.

David Marwell, former chief of investigative research at the Department of Justice's Office of Special Investigations, was hired to do a global search to find Mengele. He wrote his findings in the new book Mengele, Unmasking The 'Angel of Death'

Mengele put pairs of twins in small wooden cages and painfully injected them daily in the back with bacteria that caused an infection of the mouth or genitals, leading to gangrenous boils.

He applied painful clamps to children's limbs to induce gangrene, injected dye into their eyes, gave them injections in the spine and spinal taps with no anesthesia.

He did blood tests and transfusions from one twin to the other.

Typhus and tuberculosis were given to one twin but not the other. If one died, the other would be killed with an injection of chloroform to the heart to study and compare the effects of the disease.

Mengele operated without anesthetics for procedures removing organs, performing castration or amputation. He injected prisoners in the heart with chloroform or phenol that instantly caused blood coagulation.

Victims were purposely killed for just after-death measurements and examination Organs, eyes, blood samples and tissues were sent to a lab for further study and to be dissected.

All victims suffered unbearable pain and an agonizing death.

Mengele also injected eyes of people who had different color pupils to see if he could change the eye color.

He pinned hundreds of human eyes to the wall like a butterfly collection.

Mengele took his turn on the ramp where the starved and exhausted prisoners arrived at the camp in trains or cattle cars, packed so tightly that the dead ones were still standing.

Known as t he Angel of Death and the most notorious war criminal of all time, Mengele (pictured) was a medical monster and intent on destroying the perceived enemies of the Aryan race – the Jews – and creating the ideal German community. He had earned a PhD in anthropology from the University of Munich before joining the Institute for Hereditary Biology and Racial Hygiene and working with a German geneticist

'Mengele stalked the nightmares and haunted the daydreams of legions and emerged as the embodiment not only of the Holocaust itself but also of the failure of justice in the wake of the war that allowed so many Nazi murderers and accomplices to escape justice,' Marwell writes. Pictured: An undated file photo of the main gate of the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz, in Poland. Writing over the gate reads: 'Arbeit macht frei (Work liberates)'

Each SS officer on duty on the ramp decided with the flick of a wrist to the left or the right who among the 430,000 Hungarian Jews deported to the Auschwitz II concentration camp in 1943 were going to live and work, and who were going to be sent to the gas chambers.

Mengele decided who was going to be a victim of his medical experiments.

Mengele was always there sober, unlike the other officers, culling inmates, determining fates and searching through new arrivals to find twins or anyone with unusual traits.

Reportedly some 3,000 twins were pulled from the masses, mostly children, but only 200 survived.

'The vast majority of people who encountered Mengele on the ramp shortly after arriving in Auschwitz did not survive', the author notes.

The camp became the perfect lab for Mengele to pursue his own perverted scientific interests that he viewed as a cutting edge endeavor.

Prisoners from Auschwitz – including children selected by Mengele – were sent to other concentration camps to serve as subjects for tuberculosis experimentation and were infected with the disease.

'The children were hanged from the heating pipes in a school in Hamburg to hide evidence of these experiments', Marwell reports.

Prisoners suffering from schizophrenia and depression were subjected to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).

The goal was to treat incapacitated prisoners so that they could return to the work force.

Most of the experiments were unsuccessful and led to the death of the prisoners.

Mengele had earned a PhD in anthropology from the University of Munich before joining the Institute for Hereditary Biology and Racial Hygiene and working with a German geneticist.

The science Mengele (center) was pursuing at Auschwitz was consistent with what was being carried out in the scientific establishment. But his 'research was criminal – and monstrous – and pushed scientific research across ethical boundaries', writes the author

With thousands upon thousands of helpless victims, Auschwitz was the ideal lab for Mengele - and his deeds proved to be the darkest nightmare of modern history. Pictured: Mengele's hand written notes in mostly German, Spanish, and Portuguese

Most of Mengele's twisted experiments were almost exclusively done in pursuit of his own pseudo-scientific specialization, instead of being conducted for practical scientific reasons.

Arriving at Auschwitz allowed Mengele to pursue his work unchecked 'to protect and 'improve' the German race', all part of the Nazis rhetoric to create a new racial order and safeguard German blood.

With thousands upon thousands of helpless victims, Auschwitz was the ideal lab for Mengele - and his deeds proved to be the darkest nightmare of modern history.

The author finds it difficult to accept testimony about some of the experiments attributed to Mengele – creating a Siamese twin by 'sewing together' two twins, or making boys into girls or girls into boys or even connecting the urinary tract of a 7-year old girl to her own colon – as reported by other authors.

'Given Mengele's ambition, it is clear that he pursued his science not as some renegade propelled solely by evil and bizarre impulses but rather in a manner that his mentors and his peers could judge as meeting the highest standards', writes Marwell.

The science he was pursuing at Auschwitz was consistent with what was being carried out in the scientific establishment.

But his 'research was criminal – and monstrous – and pushed scientific research across ethical boundaries', writes the author.

By the beginning of 1945, the Soviets were advancing on Auschwitz and the SS evacuated inmates by embarking on death marches in the bitter winter to other camps and then blowing up the crematorium complexes.

Mengele believed to the end that Hitler's weapons would rescue the Germans from defeat. He was wrong and the Third Reich collapsed.

Mengele was soon on the run.

He was able to join up with a German military field hospital and dressed himself as a German Army officer, ditching the SS uniform.

He developed a cogent cover story, eliminated his service in the SS and tried on different names.

Mengele had cleverly avoided getting a tattoo when he was in the SS, the very blood-type tattoo he had implemented.

An old school friend he visited gave him a discharge certificate he had in the name of another physician and now the Angel of Death was Fritz Holmann.

He disappeared working on a farm 12-14 hours a day earning some money.

The young woman he had married and bore him a son publicly declared her husband dead.

But living in the forest, Mengele stayed in touch with his family. He needed their financial help to leave Germany.

The preferred route was through an Italian port, so Mengele crossed into Italy by way of Austria and secured false documents.

With a new ID issued in the name of Helmut Gregor by a Nazi-oriented group in South Tyrol, and money that arrived from his father which would pay for a guide, Mengele was set to travel to Argentina.

The trip was confirmed with the issuance of a Red Cross passport.

'A Red Cross passport was an essential element in the escape of so many Nazis for departing Italy and gaining entry to South America'.

Mengele almost didn't make it when the official who was expected to issue a visa for him wasn't there.

An 1949 immigration document, reads the name of Helmut Greger, the name which Mengele used when he entered in Argentina, shortly after the World War II ended

In 1985, Germany, Israel and the United States formed a cooperative effort to find Mengele although they had all searched for him on their own. The Angel of Death was finally located in June 1985 – dead. He had died in a swimming accident in 1979 and his body buried in São Paulo. Pictured: Mengele's house where he reportedly lived from 1973-1979

He was interrogated, accused of committing horrific crimes against Italian prisoners of war – but continued to say he was from South Tyrol.

His contact finally showed up and Mengele was on his way on the North Queen to Argentina – traveling as Helmut Gregor to a new continent in 1949.

He went to the theater, concerts and attended lectures with sophisticated people for nearly a decade before he was forced to change his name and disappear.

By the time the German justice officials produced an extradition request to the lethargic bureaucracy of Argentina, Mengele had been gone for months and settled in Paraguay in 1960.

With his contacts, he was one step ahead.

In 1985, Germany, Israel and the United States formed a cooperative effort to find Mengele although they had all searched for him on their own.

There were leads that he was living in Ethiopia, Argentina, Egypt, Peru, Chile, Brazil and Ecuador.

Family members were surveilled to learn anything.

The Angel of Death was finally located in June 1985 – dead. He had died in a swimming accident in 1979 and his body buried in São Paulo.

The author was there when they exhumed the body and held his bones in his hands.

'Among the last written words of his life, Mengele was unrepentant to the end and expressed no remorse'.

493,"Expecting 'flak,' Aussies return to scene of cricket...",['Associated Press'],"It's maybe the final acid test of the rehabilitation of David Warner and Steve Smith as they return to the country where they played central roles in one of the most scandalous episodes in cricket.

Warner, Smith and Australia are back in South Africa for the first time since the ball-tampering drama of two years ago that led to 12-month bans for Warner and Smith, lost Smith the captaincy, and threw their team into turmoil.

The two batsmen, two of Australia's best, returned to international cricket nearly a year ago following the bans by their national board. But this week gives South Africa fans their first chance to personally ""welcome"" them back.

""There´s no doubt we´re going to cop a bit of flak from the South African crowds,"" Australia allrounder Mitchell Marsh said. ""I think it´s really important we cop it with a smile on our face. We know what´s happening.""

Indeed, Australia, and Warner and Smith in particular, are going to have to grin and bear it.

A three-match Twenty20 series gets underway on Friday at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg, notoriously home to a vocal and hostile crowd, and where Australia's ill-fated 2018 tour ended.

Australia and South Africa will also play three one-day internationals.

That test series two years ago was littered by unsavory incidents even before Warner convinced teammate Cameron Bancroft to illegally tamper with the ball to try and get an advantage in the third test in Cape Town. Smith, as captain, knew about the plan and allowed it to go ahead.

Bancroft is not on this tour but Warner and Smith will almost certainly be targeted by boos and taunting. South African officials hope nothing worse.

""Our guys are expecting that,"" Australia captain Aaron Finch said. ""Regardless of what I think, the crowd are going to act however they please so I don´t think it´s going to make much difference to us.""

Warner, a combustible character with previous disciplinary issues, will especially be under scrutiny. He was at the center of the ill-feeling in 2018 even before the ball tampering. He and South Africa wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock - South Africa's captain for this series - had a heated confrontation on the dressing room stairs in the first test and had to be pulled apart by teammates. It stemmed from Warner's on-field sledging, or taunting, of de Kock, who responded.

Warner, because of that, was targeted by the South African crowds in the second test. And he had a verbal altercation with a supporter on the edge of the field in the third game. The series exploded into controversy with the Warner-led plan to tamper with the ball using a piece of sandpaper later in that third test, but there was all-out animosity between the teams well before.

Cricket-wise, this series is the chance for both to begin fine-tuning ahead of the Twenty20 World Cup in Australia in October and November. That's not where the focus has been.

Justin Langer, who took over as Australia coach in the aftermath of the ball-tampering scandal, said he has established a more respectful ethos in the team. What the 2018 scandal also revealed was that teams appeared to be sick of Australia, for years the dominant force in cricket, dishing out the sledging but complaining when it came back at them.

The Australia team has done much soul-searching since.

""We´ve talked a lot about this in the team, changing culture,"" Langer said. ""It´s a great game and you want to see good battles between skills, between the batters and the bowlers. And we want to see it played in great spirit.

""From an Australian cricket point of view, I think we´ve shown that we´re ready to embrace that. We´ve done it for 18 months now and there´s absolutely no reason why that won´t continue.""

Will the South African fans embrace it, too?

""I would plead with South African fans to respect our opponents and don't go overboard with these things,"" interim Cricket South Africa CEO Jacques Faul told Australian media.

But Mike Haysman, an Australian and former player who lives in South Africa and commentates on cricket, expects hostility.

""Warner will cop it. South African supporters are like that. The bottom line is David made his bed and he's got to lie in it,"" Haysman told Australia's Wide World of Sports.

Haysman said some fans will ""treat the whole thing in good humor"" but there will ""definitely be people who'll go low.""

Warner lost the war of words in 2018. But he arrives in South Africa with his bat doing all the talking after a highly successful comeback amid plenty of derision from other crowds. He was chosen as Australia's best player of 2019.

""David loves that banter that comes from the crowd and it sort of gets him into the game,"" Finch said.

494,Iran's FM says his meeting with US senator spooked Trump,['Associated Press'],"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - Iran´s foreign minister said Wednesday that he believes his recent meeting with a U.S. senator had spooked the Trump administration because it was an opportunity to talk directly to ""the American nation.""

Mohammad Javad Zarif met last week with Sen. Chris Murphy on the sidelines of an international security conference in Germany. The Connecticut Democrat defended the meeting on Tuesday after his actions were questioned in conservative media, and as President Donald Trump suggested they may have violated U.S. law. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he hoped anyone who meets with Zarif would be reflecting the U.S. position with Iran.

""Trump and Pompeo are afraid of a senator hearing facts from the Iranian foreign minister,"" Zarif said, speaking to reporters after a weekly cabinet meeting. He said this wasn't his first face-to-face chat with an American lawmaker in the last 20 years. It was not immediately clear which senators he'd met with.

Murphy said meeting Zarif was important because it is ""dangerous not to talk to one´s enemies,"" adding: ""I have no delusions about Iran - they are our adversary.""

Tehran and Washington came close to an open conflict in January, when a U.S. drone strike in Iraq killed Iran´s top general. Iran retaliated with missile strikes on a base housing U.S. troops in Iraq.

Tensions have been escalating steadily since 2018, when Trump pulled the U.S. out of Tehran´s nuclear deal with world powers. The Trump administration reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran as part of its ""maximum pressure campaign"" on the Islamic republic.

495,Erdogan criticizes EU move to enforce arms embargo on...,['Associated Press'],"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) - Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday criticized the European Union´s decision to launch a new maritime effort focused on enforcing the U.N arms embargo around Libya, accusing European nations that agreed to launch the new operation of ""interfering in the region.""

Erdogan also hailed a decision by Libya´s U.N.-supported government to withdraw from talks with rivals following an attack on the sea port of the Libyan capital, Tripoli.

EU foreign ministers had agreed earlier this week to end Operation Sophia, the bloc´s naval mission in the Mediterranean Sea, and launch a new maritime effort focused more on the implementation of the U.N. arms embargo around Libya.

Operation Sophia was set up in 2015 as tens of thousands of migrants headed across the sea from North Africa to Europe. Its aim was to crack down on migrant smugglers, but also to enforce the arms embargo, which is routinely being flouted.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said several European countries had offered to take part in the new operation.

""I want to specifically mention that the EU does not have the right to make any decision concerning Libya,"" Erdogan said. ""The EU is trying to take charge of the situation and interfere.""

Two Libyan militia commanders and a Syrian war monitor group say Turkey is deploying Syrian extremists to fight in Libya's civil war. These extremists are affiliated with groups like al-Qaida and the Islamic State. They're fighting as mercenaries on behalf of the United Nations-supported government in Libya. The Libyan sources told The Associated Press that Turkey has airlifted more than 2,500 foreign fighters into Tripoli, and that ""dozens"" are extremist-affiliated. (AP Photo/Hazem Ahmed, File)

""You have no such authority,"" Erdogan said, addressing the EU. He made the comments during a speech to legislators from his ruling party in Parliament.

Libya has been in turmoil since 2011, when a civil war toppled long-time dictator Moammar Gadhafi, who was later killed. Relentless turmoil subsequently engulfed the oil-rich country, which is now split between rival governments based in its east and west, each backed by an array of foreign countries apparently jockeying for influence in order to control Libya´s resources.

The U.N.-supported government in Tripoli backed by Turkey and Qatar. On the other side are eastern-based forces of commander Khalifa Hifter, which rely on military assistance from the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, as well as France and Russia.

Fighting between the country´s factions has intensified over the past year. Recently, Ankara sent hundreds of Syrian fighters, including militants affiliated with groups such as al-Qaida and the Islamic State group, to fight on behalf of the Tripoli-based government to defend the city from Hifter's offensive.

The Turkish leader also voiced support to Tuesday's decision by the Tripoli-based government to suspend its participation in U.N.-brokered talks in Geneva, following an attack by Hifter forces on the city's port.

""At the moment, the legitimate government based in Tripoli has withdrawn from the (negotiating) table and this is a positive decision, it is a rightful decision, it is the right decision,"" Erdogan said.

He added that Turkey would continue the Tripoli-based government to ""establish dominance"" over the whole of the country.

Hifter´s forces claimed they hit a weapons and ammunition depot at the port on Tuesday ""in order to weaken the combat capabilities of the mercenaries who arrived from Syria"" to fight alongside Tripoli-based militias.

The Geneva talks between Libya's warring sides had resumed earlier on Tuesday in a bid to salvage a fragile cease-fire in the North African nation. The current cease-fire was brokered by Russia and Turkey on Jan. 12 to deescalate the fight for control of Tripoli, but both sides have repeatedly violated the truce.

496,Mother of three kids murdered by their father in Brisbane car blast tragedy dies in hospital,"['Brittany Chain', 'Brittany Chain For Daily Mail Australia']","Hannah Baxter pictured with her 'main man', son Trey in a beach snap

A mother of three children who were killed by their father when he set the family car alight has died in hospital.

Hannah Baxter, 31, survived the initial inferno, which killed Aaliyah, six, Laianah, four, and Trey, three on Wednesday morning.

She was taken to the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital after the blast with burns so severe witnesses said her skin was peeling off her body as she screamed in agony.

By Wednesday afternoon her condition had deteriorated. She was pronounced dead early this evening.

Her estranged husband, Rowan Charles Baxter, also survived the initial blast but stabbed himself in the chest beside the burning car as neighbours desperately tried to free his children.

The 42-year-old former NRL player jumped in the car as Ms Baxter strapped the children in to do the school drop off.

She was parked down the road from her parents home in Camp Hill, in Brisbane's south-east. She and the children had reportedly been staying there since separating with Baxter about two months ago.

The couple were reportedly working through a nasty custody battle after their separation.

Witness Andrew Sinclair said he will never forget seeing Ms Baxter writhing in agony as her body burned.

'The look of hurt looking straight at me, and seeing her clothing being burnt with her skin coming off her body, it was an awful thing to see,' he said.

Baxter's New Years' Day post: The killer former NRL player brought in the new year with this post of his children in the shallows. 'Goodnight ratbags always in my heart,' it was captioned

Bodies were seen being loaded into the back of a funeral van on Wednesday afternoon, the family's burnt-out Kia Sportage can be seen in the background being examined by police

Flowers and a dolly were placed on a grassy patch near where the tragedy unfolded after three young children were killed

Another neighbour said she was entirely conscious and aware of what had happened.

'Skin was peeling off her, and she held her hands up... bits were hanging off. It was really quite horrific,' the man said.

Aaron Snell, another neighbour who witnessed the tragedy, said he initially thought he was watching a road rage attack before he realised the gravity of the situation.

By the time he reacted, Ms Baxter had escaped from the car and was rolling on the footpath in an attempt to smother the flames.

A Good Samaritan was also trying to hose her down to stop the fire.

Witnesses said they heard her shouting 'he's poured petrol on me' at the time.

Baxter was also still alive.

He was across the road, but returned to the car to salvage a knife. He then stabbed himself in the chest, Mr Snell said.

Mr Snell, who is trained in CPR, said he was trying to assess whether he could perform it on Baxter because he was 'just in all matter of states,' he told The Courier Mail.

Queensland Police officers were called to a family violence incident allegedly involving the couple just last month

Neighbours said all they could see was thick, black smoke - followed by flames reaching into the air

Wreckage: This is the white Kia Sportage SUV that went up in flames in Camp Hill, in Brisbane's south east, at about 8.20am on Wednesday

'As I came to the front after calling Triple-0, I saw her (Hannah). She was smoking, her body was smoking and on fire,' Mr Snell said.

By this point, others were on the scene and trying to put out the fire in an attempt to save the children, who were still trapped inside.

Mr Snell believes Baxter attempted to stop them helping his children in his final moments.

'He was so angry and just going absolutely crazy. It appeared like he wanted [the car] to burn,' he said.

Baxter, an ex-New Zealand Warriors player, stabbed himself with a knife during the horrific attack on his family.

The couple had recently separated and shut down the business they ran together, Integr8 Fitness, based at Capalaba.

In recent months, Baxter flooded his Facebook site with photos and videos of his children, describing them as his 'world'.

'T-R-E-Y, love you to the moon and back,' he posted six days ago.

A month earlier, he captioned a post: 'Goodnight my babies, Daddy loves you.'

But in disturbing footage also shared to his social media, Baxter 'roughed up' his kids to toughen them up.

He slammed his youngest, Trey's, head into the corner of a bed multiple times and pretended to strangle him while holding him in a headlock in video shared online.

The comments section of the video, as well as a photo where he throws Trey high into the air, have been flooded by strangers who claim the posts show a 'blatant disregard' for the children's safety.

500,Mother of disabled boy who died in hospital reveals what doctors wrote on his death certificate,"['Australian Associated', 'Australian Associated Press And Jackson Barron For Daily Mail Australia']","The mother of a disabled boy has revealed the shocking words that doctors wrote on her son's death certificate.

Rachel Browne told the the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability in Sydney that Down syndrome was listed as a cause of death on her son Finlay's death certificate.

The 16-year-old from Bathurst in New South Wales died following an agonizing 71-day fight in hospital in 2016 which included 12 abdominal surgeries and 65 days spent in the paediatric intensive care unit.

Finlay lived with autism and Down syndrome and fell rapidly ill in September 2016, suffering terrible pain, vomiting and had blood in his faeces and was rushed to Bathurst Hospital.

As Finlay left the house for what would be the last time, his mother and father were on either side of him.

'He put an arm around each of us and he looked up and said, I love you mum, I love you dad,' Ms Browne told the hearing.

Rachel Browne (pictured) told the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability in Sydney that doctors wrote 'trisomy 21,' or Down syndrome as the cause of her son Finlay's death

Finlay collapsed on arrival at the hospital, with a CT scan revealing he had significant abdominal obstruction which would require surgical intervention.

Later that night, Finlay was taken into theatre and the next morning was flown to the Children's Hospital at Westmead where he underwent further surgery.

Following his 12 operations, the majority of Finlay's small bowel was removed, and the family was told he would never eat or drink again.

As a result of his injuries, Finlay's liver and kidneys were shutting down.

'He kept saying, Mum, I want to go home ... I wanted to get him home but it became evident that if he did recover he would have no quality of life,' Ms Browne said.

After a final surgery, the decision was made to withdraw treatment, and he died in December 2016 with his family around him.

On Finlay's death certificate, which was shown to the commission, 'trisomy 21,' or Down syndrome, is listed among the causes of death.

'(This) indicates that one of the causes of Finlay's death is in fact his Down syndrome,' Ms Browne said.

Ms Browne would like to see policy changed to ensure it is not ordinary course to identify a person with intellectual disability, and their disability, on a death certificate if it was not part of the cause of the person's death.

She had received questionable comments from medical professionals throughout Finlay's life, including from a doctor in hospital the day he was born.

'The doctor said that he felt there was something wrong with Finlay and I had commented that I knew, I'd felt that he had Down syndrome, he said to me that it was okay because I was young and I could have more children,' Ms Browne said.

Six months after Finlay's death, Ms Browne addressed Bathurst Hospital staff.

Ms Browne approached Bathurst Hospital (pictured) staff after Finlay's death and lodged complaints with them and the NSW Healthcare Complaints Commission

'I wanted clinicians to know what the ramifications of their inaction were to not only Fin, but to his family, to his friends,' she said.

'That this young man had a life, a life well lived - he was just not a person with a disability, he was a human being.'

Ms Browne has also lodged complaints with Bathurst Hospital and the NSW Healthcare Complaints Commission.

The commission indicated the matter should not go to formal investigation but have suggested engaging in a conciliation process.

Ms Browne has written to the NSW Health Minister and is currently awaiting a decision on whether a coronial inquest will be held into Finlay's death.

It's over! Married At First Sight's Mikey Pembroke and Natasha Spencer appeared to end their marriage on Wednesday's episode following an explosive dinner party fight

'I'm glad we consummated our marriage,' Natasha gushed the next morning.

'It was good, but I wouldn't say it was the longest session that we've ever had,' Mikey sheepishly admitted.

'You don't regret the 10 seconds?' Mikey asked Natasha, sending her into a fit of giggles.

'Best 10 seconds of my life!' she shot back with a laugh. 'I can't wait to make it 20!'

'Best ten seconds of my life!' The couple joked together about how Mikey had only lasted ten seconds in the bedroom

Once they arrived at the dinner party, Natasha repeated the same joke to Michael, 28 - who immediately ran to producers and vowed to bring the issue up over dinner to create drama.

'Mikey's gonna blow up when someone does the right thing and tells him what she said - I'll do it!' Michael told a producer.

As soon as he got the chance, Michael pulled Mikey aside to tell him an exaggerated version of his conversation with Natasha.

'I'll do it!' Michael decided to tell Mikey that Natasha had joked about his skills in the bedroom in a bid to stir up drama at the dinner party

'She was trying to make you look like a mug in front of me,' he told a horrified Mikey.

'I feel so sorry for you,' Michael continued. 'Your bird has just come in here and said you last 10 seconds in the bedroom!'

508,Are YOU fit enough for your age? Trainers share the exercises should be able to do in every decade,"['Alice Murphy', 'Alice Murphy For Daily Mail Australia']","Running five kilometres in less than 30 minutes should be no trouble to people of average fitness in their 20s, 30s and 40s - and you should still be able to lift half your bodyweight by the age of 50, according to health experts.

Australian NRL player turned personal trainer Ben Lucas joined forces with Adala Bolto, the founder of women-only gym chain Zadi Training, to outline the fitness milestones you should be hitting in every decade.

Performing 20 push ups and the same amount of burpees back-to-back should be easily accomplished throughout your 20s and 30s, while you shouldn't be breaking much of a sweat climbing multiple sets of stairs in your 40s.

Fitness levels diverge dramatically for men and women once they reach their 50s, as the menopause prompts a dramatic drop in female oestrogen levels, causing muscles to shrink and skin to sag.

But there's a simple way to slow the effects of ageing - if you follow the right exercise routine.



Australian NRL player turned personal trainer Ben Lucas (right) joined forces with women-only gym founder Adala Bolto (left) to outline the fitness milestones you should be hitting in every decade

IN YOUR 20s

Blended workouts of cardio, weights, balancing and stretching exercises are the best way to keep fit and supple throughout your 20s, which is the most important time to build a solid foundation of fitness for the rest of your life.

'Make sure you maintain good form as you want to create a solid foundation, rather than having niggles and injuries that cause you stress in later life,' Mr Lucas said.

Ms Bolto believes mastering perfect squatting technique is the first fitness lesson which should be learned in your 20s.

'It works the largest muscle group, such as quads, glutes and hamstrings, which not only strengthens and tones your body, but also provides a massive calorie burn during workouts,' she said.

In your 20s, you should be able to run five kilometres in less than 30 minutes, deadlift half your bodyweight, perform squats with ease and do 20 push ups without stopping, either on your toes or on your knees.

IN YOUR 30s

Maintaining a steady routine of cardio and strength training is vital in your 30s, as career commitments and family life take priority over fitness.

'This is the time to opt for 30-45 minute classes that are easier to fit into your day,' said Mr Lucas.

'In your 30s, high intensity interval training may be a good option for those who want to make the most of their time. If you work a highly stressful job, yoga is another good option to keep on top of your fitness.'

Women lose muscle mass as they progress through their 30s, but the effects can be countered with targeted bodyweight exercises like squats, deadlifts, unassisted pull ups and push ups on your toes.

In your 30s, you should still be able to run five kilometres in roughly 30 minutes, perform 20 burpees and push ups back to back, deadlift half your bodyweight and hold a plank for one minute.



Ms Bolto says women should incorporate targeted bodyweight exercises like squats, deadlifts, unassisted pull ups and push ups on toes to maintain a svelte physique throughout the 30s

IN YOUR 40s

The 40s are the danger zone when most people start to gain considerable weight, making it the perfect decade to incorporate high intensity resistance training into your schedule, which has been proven to burn fat for up to 38 hours post workout.

But running, jogging and brisk walking are equally important for maintaining cardiovascular fitness, according to Mr Lucas.

'You need to be sure you're getting some good cardio as well. Pilates is also great as it builds your core strength and fights back pain, especially if you have a sedentary job,' he said.

Ms Bolto agrees, recommending regular power walks and short sprints to improve endurance and stamina.

In your 40s, you should still be running between three and five kilometres in 30 minutes, deadlifting half your bodyweight and climbing multiple flights of stairs without much difficulty.

Mr Lucas says strength training and regular cardio are essential to stave off stiffness and joint problems like arthritis

IN YOUR 50s

Fitness begins to diverge according to gender over the course of the 50s, with men more likely to retain greater strength and stamina than women as oestrogen sharply declines during the menopause.

Strength training and regular cardio are essential to stave off stiffness and joint problems like arthritis, according to Mr Lucas.

'This is the decade where aches and pains start to crop up. You should be doing strength training twice a week to maintain your muscle mass,' he said.

Compound exercises, which use multiple muscle groups at the same time to perform a movement, are women's best antidote to age-related weight gain and muscle wastage.

Ms Bolto recommends sets of squats with overhead shoulder presses, walking lunges with bicep curls and push ups with dumbbell rows for females over 50.

In your 50s, men should be able to do 15-19 push ups and 20-24 sit ups, while women should be able to do between seven and 10 push ups and 15-19 sit ups.

IN YOUR 60s and 70s

Keeping active from the age of 60 on is essential to decrease the likelihood of chronic disease.

'You still should be working on your strength and flexibility at least twice a week so I would suggest signing up to a gym that specialises in training older adults or get a personal trainer who can assist you,' Mr Lucas said.

He also recommends spicing up your workout routine with classes of ballroom dancing or aqua aerobics to keep things interesting.

509,St Kevin's headmaster resigns after writing reference for convicted child groomer,"['Zoe Zaczek', 'Kelsey Wilkie', 'Tita Smith For Daily Mail Australia']","St Kevin's College headmaster Stephen Russell (pictured) wrote a glowing reference letter for convicted child sex offender and former coach Peter Kehoe ahead of his sentencing in 2015. Mr Russell resigned on Wednesday

The headmaster of an elite Melbourne school embroiled in a child grooming scandal has resigned and the head of sport has been stood down.

In a letter issued to parents on Wednesday, St Kevin's College headmaster Stephen Russell said students' wellbeing was his biggest priority and 'the current situation means that the best way to achieve this is to resign'.

The resignation comes after Mr Russell and head of sport Luke Travers wrote glowing character references for Peter Kehoe in court, as revealed in an explosive report by ABC's Four Corners.

Kehoe, a former running coach at the $19,000-a-year school, was convicted of grooming a student under the age of 16 in 2015.

Headmaster and Dean of Sport at Elite Melbourne private boys school St Kevin's College (pictured) have been accused of siding with an athletics coach after allegations of child grooming were made by a student

The child groomer said he had no comment to make about the controversy and claimed he was the victim of harassment, when approached by The Australian.

He threatened to 'lodge a complaint with the police regards (sic) harassment' if the publication contacted him again.

A spokesperson for St Kevin's said Mr Russell's resignation was effective immediately.

St Kevin's dean of sport Mr Travers has also been stood down, pending an investigation.

Mr Russell said he was grateful to the St Kevin's school community for the '24 years of nurturing' he and his family had received.

'I extend my best wishes and encouragement to the current student body to be good people, the way so many who went before them have been across the decades,' Mr Russell wrote.

The headmaster praised his colleagues for their hard work, saying, 'Their loyalty, diligence and astuteness have allowed us to create the fine school that St Kevin's is today.'

Mr Russell thanked his family for their support during his time as headmaster.

'My family's wellbeing and safety and long term happiness have also been factors in my decision,' he said in the letter.

Mr Russell was under significant pressure to resign this week after the ABC lifted the lid on his character reference for Kehoe.

Peter Kehoe received a two-year community corrections order and 100 hours of community work.

Mr Russell and Mr Travers wrote court character references for Mr Kehoe.

Former running coach of St Kevin's Peter Kehoe was convicted and sentenced to a community corrections order in April 2015

Edmund Rice Education Australia (EREA), the governing body of St Kevin's, confirmed that John Crowley would take over as headmaster.

Mr Crowley, who is currently the principal of St Patrick's College in Ballarat, will be headmaster until the end of the 2020 school year.

The EREA statement released on Wednesday added that Mr Travers had been formally stood down 'pending further investigations of issues raised during the Four Corners program'. No replacement has been named for Mr Travers.

The student was in Year 9 when his athletics coach Peter Kehoe began sending him disturbing messages on Facebook.

They included telling the boy he loved him, saying his thighs were 'gorgeous' and that he was the 'best thing since sliced bread'.

When the victim, who is now 20, mentioned how he had a Japanese oral presentation due, Kehoe replied: 'That's not the only oral you'll have to do'.

The schoolboy also said Kehoe made comments about chocolate milk dripping down his face that left him feeling 'tense'.

The most traumatising incident happened after training one day, when Kehoe invited the boy over to his home to look at old yearbooks.

Luke Travers, the dean of sport, also gave evidence in support of Kehoe during the trial. He has been stood down, pending an investigation

'It was probably one of the scariest times of my life,' the boy told ABC's Four Corners.

The student only escaped the unnerving situation when his mother called and Kehoe had to drive him home.

The boy and his mother went to the police after the incident and Kehoe was charged with one count of grooming a child under the age of 16.

The schoolboy left the school while the case was heard in court.

Bravely discussing how he fell victim to child grooming, he said 'everything in my life changed' from the moment he gave an interview to police.

He claimed no one from the school had been in touch with him or his family during that time to offer support.

The school released a statement saying 'the care and development of students, staff and the broader St Kevin's community is, and always has been, our first priority'.

'The actions of Peter Kehoe were completely unacceptable and St Kevin's College strongly condemns them. After his conviction, he was immediately banned from entering the school or having any contact with the college or its students,' it read.

Messages included telling the boy he loved him, saying his thighs were 'gorgeous' and that he was the 'best thing since sliced bread'

'For legal reasons, St Kevin's College is not able to provide any further comment at this time.'

Ahead of the release of Four Corners' exposé, Mr Russell penned a letter to parents warning the college would feature on the program but did not go into detail.

'Dear parents and guardians,' the letter provided to 3AW begins.

'We are aware that St Kevin's College will be featured in a program by the ABC Four Corners. It is likely to air on 17 February.

'We felt it was important to inform our parents of this program.

'We are currently seeking professional advice and will be in a better position to respond and communicate with you again, once we see the actual program.'

The leader of the prestigious Catholic school then promised children would be provided with 'support' in the aftermath of the television report.

'Our students will be supported and spoken to on the day after the program in age-appropriate addresses and assemblies,' he continued.

Kehoe (pictured) was convicted and sentenced to a community corrections order in April 2015

'It would be inappropriate to make further comment until then. In the meantime, please be assured that, as always, the care of our students is our first priority.'

Last October, St Kevin's College was plunged into controversy after a video surfaced of students singing a sexist chant on a tram.

The school responded by immediately suspending the students involved, but a second video came to light days later of students performing another x-rated rap.

After the leaked videos generated negative publicity, a former student spoke out against the 'misogynistic culture' he believed was entrenched within the all-boys school.

Founded in 1918, St Kevin's College is a leading Catholic boys school based in Melbourne's most expensive suburb, Toorak.

The student settled a civil claim against the school last year.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8018845/St-Kevins-headmaster-resigns-writing-reference-convicted-child-groomer.html
510,"Inside the 'run down' Queensland childcare centre where a boy, 3, who was found dead in its minibus","['Alisha Rouse', 'Alisha Rouse For Daily Mail Australia']","A toddler who died in a childcare minibus had been waved off by his devastated family that morning, as insiders reveal the catalogue of failings at the centre of the tragedy.

The three-year-old boy was found dead after being abandoned in a Goodstart Early Learning daycare bus parked outside a primary school in northern Queensland on Tuesday.

Mystery surrounds why the tragedy took place, after the daycare company insisted they had strict safety procedures.

But sources close to the centre told Daily Mail Australia staff were 'ever-changing' and that the 'run down' centre had 'no consistency'.

It is also understood that protocol, which dictates a child must be signed in and out of the bus, may not have been followed - leaving the toddler to swelter for up to six hours.

Among a catalogue of potentially fatal errors, insiders said:

Children are supposed to be strictly checked in and out of the minibus

checked in and out of the minibus The minibus is understaffed with just one carer, who is also the driver

carer, who is also the driver If the child does not arrive at daycare, family should be immediately contacted

contacted Head checks are supposed to be done every 30 minutes, as well as eating records

Yard checks must also be undertaken to ensure every youngster is accounted for

The toddler was found in the daycare minibus (pictured) outside a primary school in Edmonton, Queensland, on Tuesday

The boy was found in a bus outside Hambledon State School, just 1.7km from his daycare, Goodstart Early Learning, in Edmonton (pictured)

Head checks are supposed to be done every 30 minutes, with records taken of what youngsters eat and drink, which would have alerted staff that the toddler was missing.

It is not known if these procedures were not followed, but the young boy was eventually found by the 'distraught' driver at 3.15pm - having been picked up from his home at 9.15am.

This means the defenceless toddler could have been trapped in the bus for up to six hours, as temperatures in the area reached 34C.

Such blistering heat can quickly turn a stationary vehicle into a death trap.

His family are believed to be Aboriginal, and are being supported by Indigenous family liaison officers.

The driver was said to be in such a 'distraught' state that he was taken to hospital suffering from shock, and has not yet been able to speak to police.

It it understood tragedy struck when the little boy was left alone in the bus outside Hambledon State School in Edmonton after older children were dropped off.

But police insisted on Tuesday afternoon that the investigation was in its early stages, and that they didn't know if the boy had been in the bus all day.

Previous incidents at Goodstart Early Learning A similar incident took place on the Gold Coast in 2018, when a little girl was left in the back of a bus. The toddler, Violet, was abandoned by staff for more than an hour as temperatures soared to 30C. Luckily, she was found in time and rushed to hospital with dehydration. She had been left on a bus outside Goodstart Early Learning in Parkwood.

A source explained the toddler was often picked up by the bus in the mornings, alongside other daycare children and young school students, and should have been monitored.

'The little boy was supposed to be at care all day,' the source said.

'He uses the bus service. The childcare also does before and after school care, hence it was at the school.

'It appears after morning pick up and school run he was forgotten until the afternoon run.'

The centre was closed on Wednesday following the tragedy, with an ominous sign in its car park reading 'do not leave babies and children in parked cars'.

The Goodstart Early Learning centre in Edmonton (pictured) was closed on Wednesday following the tragedy

A sign outside Goodstart Early Learning (pictured) in Edmonton advises staff and visitors to not leave children in parked cars

An insider explained that, as per procedure, the toddler should have been signed into the bus and then signed off again when he was safely at daycare.

If he was then not seen at daycare, it would be correct protocol for carers to contact his family and check his whereabouts.

'A lot of procedure seems to not be followed,' they explained.

'It's there for a reason. And if just one of those policies and procedures above had been followed, would it be different?

'The centre is closed today, and that one already has a bad name. How would anyone want to leave their baby there now little own let them get on a bus?'

The five-room centre, which usually has around 12 members of staff, can cater for 70 children.

But it is understood that the centre wasn't full at the time of the tragedy.

It comes as Julia Davison, the CEO of Goodstart Early Learning, admitted on Sunrise her team 'don't know what happened'.

Detectives are investigating the circumstances surrounding the child's death (pictured) outside a primary school in Queensland

'All of our 15,000 educators are devastated and shocked,' she said.

'It is every family’s worst nightmare that something might happen to their child and it is every educator’s worst nightmare something might happen to a child in their care.'

The source added that ongoing staffing changes at the centre made it less safe.

'When the new Childs World Centres opened, it was a lot of competition and they lost a lot of families and staff, as you do,' they said.

'The staff that stayed were ever changing, new educators in the room all the time and no consistency.

Julia Davison, CEO of Goodstart Early Learning, called the incident 'every parent's worst nightmare' (pictured) on Sunrise

'And as you know, that's never good for little kids being left.

'It's also a bit run down. When there's a new educator all the time, it's not nice to leave your babies there.'

The centre's CEO, Ms Davison, said that it would now stop both its morning pickup and afternoon drop-off services,

'We don't know what happened, all we know is that something went badly wrong yesterday,' she said.

'We have decided that with effect from today, we will cease our pickup and drop-off service. That has been a very difficult decision for us to make.

Emergency services were called to the scene on Tuesday afternoon (pictured) after the boy's body was found

What happens to children left in hot cars? Children's bodies heat up three-to-five times faster than adults do The younger the child, the more vulnerable they are On a 29C day, temperatures inside a car can reach 44C in just ten minutes This can cause 'serious injury' and brain damage After 20 minutes, the temperature reaches a fatal 60.2C, which could kill Winding down the windows or parking in the shade will do little as it doesn't affect the car's core temperature

'We are going to see cease temporarily and we know that without our pickup and drop-off service, many children are not able to access high-quality early learning.

'But we feel that we need to just pause for a few days whilst we think about whether there are other things we can do to improve the safety of our transfers.

'We usually had lots of procedures and processes in and training in place anyway, but we want to look at what we can do to strengthen that. And we will no doubt have learnings from the investigation, but at this stage we don't know what happened yesterday.'

She insisted the centre 'always have an adequate number of staff on the bus', and that there was a procedure for checking children off the list.

The incident is being investigated by police.

Children are seen arriving at Hambledon State School (pictured) on Wednesday, hours after the toddler was found dead nearby

'It's early days and a number of factors could be at play here and we'll investigate all possibilities,' Detective Inspector Jason Smith told Nine.

'The death of any child is an awful thing which is why it's so important for us to get to the bottom of this.'

In a statement released on Wednesday afternoon, Ms Davison said: 'Goodstart Early Learning sends its deepest condolences to the family of a small boy who died in our care in Cairns yesterday.

Hambledon State School wrote on social media that it was postponing a scheduled parents' meeting following the tragedy (pictured) outside its gates

'It is a great responsibility to care for a child and each day tens of thousands of families entrust their precious children to us. It is not a responsibility we take lightly.

'While we don’t yet understand the circumstances of yesterday’s tragedy, we will of course do everything in our power to assist the authorities with their investigation.

'On behalf of every Goodstart centre across Australia and our 15,000 team members I want to extend our deepest condolences to the family who have suffered such a tragic loss.

'We will of course offer them all possible assistance.'

The iconic Bonds Baby Search provides a snapshot of the nation's most-used baby and pet names by sifting through the more than 74,000 entries for its annual competition.

Royalty served as inspiration for thousands of parents over the past 12 months, with Charlotte - Prince William and Kate Middleton's four-year-old daughter - taking the top spot as the most popular name for baby girls.

Trailing in second was Mia, the name of Zara Tindall's six-year-old daughter who is Princess Charlotte's cousin. Isla, another of Charlotte's royal cousins, came fifth.

Royal babies even had influence over pet owners, with Archie - the first name of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's infant son - ranking as the eighth most popular name for cats in Australia.

Hollywood offspring also inspired many of the nation's most popular girls names, with Harper - the name of David and Victoria Beckham's only daughter - in seventh, and Willow, Will and Jada Pinkett Smith's daughter, in eighth.

Ivy, which is the second name of superstar couple Beyoncé and Jay-Z's first child Blue Ivy, came ninth.

The celebrity trend continued for baby boys, with Mason - reality stars Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick's eldest son - in sixth.

Hudson, the name of Australian celebrity chef Curtis Stone's young son, was just behind in seventh.

Biblical names proved equally popular for boys, with monikers like Noah in second and Elijah in tenth.

The unearthed court document showed how the private was charged with disobeying orders after giving attitude to his his superior officer.

A 1918 military document revealed how an Australian soldier, Private Humby, was tried and punished after he was charged with disobeying direct orders from his commanding officer

'I am not going to get up, you can go f*** yourself,' Private Humby shot back.

Private Humby pleaded guilty to the charge and was found guilty of disobedience.

He was sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment with hard labor.

513,Tracey Cox reveals how great sex STARTS at 50,"['Tracey Cox', 'Tracey Cox For Mail Online']","My new book Great Sex Starts at 50 is my 17th book about sex and relationships and I was honestly thinking, 'Seriously, what else can I say?'.

And then I turned 50 and realised that sex after 50 is a completely different ballgame – literally – than sex before it.

Things happen when you get older, especially for women. Some good, some bad.

Great sex can start at 50 but you do need to adjust your thinking and deal with the inevitable emotional and physical changes.

My book covers a myriad of topics – everything from wobbly erections, the menopause, lack of desire, not feeling sexy and being single in the second part of your life.

But a theme throughout is the practical things you can do to age-proof your libido.

If you're over 30 and reading this, start cultivating these good sexual habits now so you'll be in great shape later.

Sex expert Tracey Cox has revealed how great sex can start at 50 - but you need to adjust your thinking and deal with the inevitable emotional and physical changes (stock image)

Stop trying to be young

Stop pining over the sex you used to have. Young sex isn't better sex, it's simply a different style of sex.

Our bodies change as we age. Our lives change. What we want from life changes.

I don't want to do the same things I wanted to in my 20s and I certainly don't want the sort of sex I had back then either (all that hard, deep thrusting – are you kidding?)

Sex in your fifties and over isn't about mad thrusting, it's gentler, unhurried, less penetration focused sex.

One reason why older couples report higher satisfaction with sex is that they slow down and spend longer on foreplay.

My book, Great Sex Starts at 50, isn't about trying to stay young. It's not about desperately trying to turn back the clock, it's about being the best version of yourself.

Flip the switch

I interviewed hundreds of women for the book.

All reported the same sort of middle-age issues: weight gain, bodies not the same after children, a few aches and creaks, menopause issues, wrinkles.

Tracey (pictured) added couples should stop trying to be young and reinvent 'sexy'

Yet some were having sex regularly and thoroughly enjoying it and others had stopped having sex or found the whole 'getting old' thing so depressing, they avoided it much as they possibly could.

There was self-acceptance and (a depressing amount of) self-loathing.

Guess which group were having the best sex?

Those who thought, 'Sure, my body's not what it was but so what? I think I'm sexy so what's the problem?' had far more sex and much better sex than those who focused on the negatives.

Lots of women love getting older. They feel more confident, not less. They worry less about what people think and more about what they really want.

They have the time to re-explore sex, get a bit more adventurous, try something new. There are upsides to getting older, focus on those not the downsides.

Flip the switch from glass half empty to glass half full.

Fix body image issues by having more sex

Having sex improves body image. How?

Enjoyable sexual experiences make us feel better about our bodies. If our partner clearly enjoys making love to it, it can't be that bad!

It's a win-win-win scenario: the better you feel about your body, the better sex is. Which makes us want sex more, which in turn helps feed a better body image.

Initiate sex to feel more sexually powerful

This is something I've used a lot with couples – and by God it works.

You simply get the person who doesn't usually initiate sex, to do just that and you turn the existing dynamic on its head.

The person who initiates sex more often is seen as the 'sexy person'. Being the 'sexy person' makes you feel sexy.

Shifting power – changing from being the person who waits to be asked for sex to the person who is demanding sex from someone else – is a highly effective way to shake a sleeping libido awake. Try it.

I've seen it turn people around from disliking sex to really enjoying it in a month or two.

Use it or lose it

'Use it or lose it' applies to pretty much everything once you get past a half century but it's crucial when it comes to sex.

The more regularly you have sex, the better shape your genitals are in.

Sex boosts our immune systems, reduces stress and improves memory. And that's just the physical benefits.

Regular sex brings pleasure into our lives and increases production of oxytocin, the cuddle hormone, promoting trust, intimacy and bonding. It makes us feel less depressed and more positive generally, enhancing self-esteem and confidence.

How much sex do you need to harness all these benefits? Once a week would do it.

'Sex' by the way, doesn't mean intercourse. But it does hopefully mean an orgasm – and that can happen during sex with yourself.

Once a week sounds quite a lot? In that case…

Find your normal

Some people feel sex-starved if they have sex once a week. Others will have an enjoyable sex session twice a year and still rate their sex life as highly satisfying.

I know plenty of long-term couples over 50 who have sex every two months and would bristle with indignation if I branded their relationship 'sexless' or 'low sex'.

The right amount of sex for both of you has nothing to do with how often you're having it and everything to do with what makes you both happy.

Yes, weekly sex is great for you physically and emotionally. But if that's just not your 'thing', don't worry about it.

There is no 'normal', only what works for the two of you.

Tracey said older couples should 'stop pining over the sex you used to have' and instead aim for 'gentler, unhurried, less penetration focused sex' (stock image)

Exercise

I appreciate health issues can interfere with our ability to exercise but if you can exercise, do it!

Exercise won't just keep you healthy and looking great, it increases blood flow – which is crucial to keep our genitals healthy and responsive.

It's also important for our brains.

Exercise increases the production of dopamine which is important for cognitive function. It also strengthens muscles, improves circulation and improves your mood.

Staying active out of bed keeps you active in it.

You'll be trimmer, your heart will be healthier (cardiovascular disease can impact on his erections), more flexible and fitter for sex.

A fit, healthy body makes us feel happier with our bodies generally.

See your doctor for solutions

If the menopause has hit you hard, see your GP.

If your doctor is the sort you know will be embarrassed, ask to see another one. Believe me, they've seen and heard it all before.

Don't be fobbed off with the advice that using a good lube is all you need. Lube helps but it's not going to make a scrap of difference in a lot of cases.

If you don't think your doctor is knowledgeable enough or dismissive, ask for a referral to see a gynaecologist or genital urinary specialist.

Alternatively, do some online research (or buy my book which has a big chapter on dealing with the menopause) or visit a menopause clinic.

If sex is uncomfortable, change your favourite position

Choose positions that don't allow deep penetration.

Any position where you're in control, rather than him, works (you on top, for instance).

Otherwise, choose positions where you're both lying fairly flat with your own legs quite close together.

Spooning sex works well, as does doggy style but with both of you lying flat with his legs on either side of yours.

Masturbate

If you're not having regular sex with a partner, have it with yourself.

Masturbating is the best and easiest way to get or stay sexually ship-shape.

Do it. A lot. Recharge your vibrator or buy one and start clocking up as many orgasms as you can.

When you're not having regular orgasms, the blood vessels get out of shape, preventing future orgasms.

If you value them, make sure you have one at least once a week for the rest of your life. (Not too much of a hardship, really.)

Reinvent 'sexy'

Some women have a strong reaction to 'sexy' and hate the idea of having to conform to a cliched idea of it as they get older.

You don't have to. Put your own spin on what's sexy.

'I'm more attracted to the idea of natural sexiness rather than painted-on, put-on sexiness,' said one 56-year-old friend.

'I think sexiness post 50 comes from looking after your body through exercise and yoga and eating well so your skin glows rather than loading on the makeup and squeezing yourself into skinny jeans.'

The gamechanger: change way your partner thrusts

For older women, this is often the key to having no sex or having quite nice sex.

Ditch the deep, hard thrusting you used to enjoy – where he pulls out quite a way before plunging back in (see, even the word 'plunge' makes you wince!).

Instead, get him to penetrate slowly, stopping every inch, to let you relax around him.

Once he's fully penetrated, keep your pelvises close and grind together in a circular motion.

He can put his hands under your buttocks to lift your bottom towards him; keep the grinding slow and consistent.

514,Woman reveals landlord offered her discounted rent in return for breast photos,"['Faith Ridler', 'Faith Ridler For Mailonline']","A house-hunting mother has been left in shock after a potential landlord offered her discounted rent in return for breast pictures for his 'modelling business'.

Georgia Linehan, from Canterbury, who spoke to the homeowner while searching for a new house on Gumtree, posted a screenshot of the strange exchange to Twitter.

In the WhatsApp conversation, she began by discussing the details of a potential rental agreement in Whitstable, Kent, for both herself and her family.

But when she asked the price of monthly rent at the property, the landlord instead offered a 'disgusting' arrangement to help her save some cash.

Georgia Linehan (pictured), from Canterbury, was left horrified after a potential landlord offered to reduce her rent if she sent him pictures of her breasts for his 'modelling business'

Shocked Georgia posted a screenshot of the strange exchange to Twitter (pictured) on Monday following her conversation with the homeowner

'There is an option to reduce rent if you wanted to', the man commented. 'I own a modelling company, a couple of my tenants work for me doing boob work basically - breast pictures.

'For two pictures the rent gets reduced by £200'.

Taking to social media to share the forward conversation, a horrified Georgia asserted it was the 'last time' she would ever turn to classified advertisement and community website Gumtree when looking for a house.

She later added she 'cannot stress enough' how much she 'hates men' after the interaction.

After confirming it would be £695, Georgia told the man she would have to think and get back to him in a couple of days.

It was then that he told the mother he could offer her an 'option to reduce rent,' before suggesting the bizarre arrangement.

Dozens of social media users were quick to take to the comments sections - with one branded the proposal 'disgusting.'

'What the actual f*** is wrong with people?' raged one, while a second penned: 'How disgusting'.

517,Hillary Clinton says she is 'waiting and watching' amid Bloomberg vice president rumors,"['Ross Ibbetson', 'Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline']","Hillary Clinton yesterday said she was 'watching and waiting' as she brushed off a question about whether she would be Mike Bloomberg's running mate.

'Should Bloomberg win the nomination would you consider being his running mate?' The moderator asked at a Clinton Global Initiative event in Puerto Rico.

'Oh no! [laughter] No. I'm just waiting and watching as this plays out.' Clinton, 72, replied as she laughed off the question. 'I will support whoever the nominee is, as for the all the reasons you can imagine ... we need to have a new president for our country.'

Last week, the 2016 Trump challenger refused to rule out the possibility when speaking to Ellen Degeneres. Although Hillary conceded 'that's probably not going to happen,' she told the host, 'never say never.'

But in the last few days there has been rampant speculation that Bloomberg, 78, was considering Clinton after Matt Drudge of Drudge Report took the unusual step of putting his name on the story. Neither party, until yesterday's markedly soft rejection in Puerto Rico, had made any attempt at denying the headlines.

'We are focused on the primary and the debate, not VP speculation,' Bloomberg Comms chief Jason Schechter said in a statement on Saturday.

Bloomberg is rapidly becoming the DNC's favorite, appearing strongly in polling and in the betting markets as the only candidate offering a real challenge to the firebrand socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Democratic presidential candidate former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg delivers remarks during a campaign rally in Nashville, Tennessee on February 12

Clinton and Bloomberg are both members of the New York elite and he gave her backing to her in 2016, saying the country must unite to 'defeat a dangerous demagogue (Trump.)'

Indeed, a Big Apple bout between Bloomberg and Trump looks set to be even more vicious and brutal than Clinton's lost battle in 2016 and both the former New York Mayor and former Secretary of State have personal vendettas against the president.

Adding fuel to the Bloomberg-Clinton fire, on Sunday it was reported that the former New York Mayor had recruited top Hillary ally, Capricia Marshall, for his 2020 campaign.

A source told PageSix that Marshall, who has worked under Bill and Hillary Clinton as well as former president Barack Obama, could help Bloomberg become more credible in numerous ways.

'Capricia is very connected to the Democratic political orbit and will give Bloomberg a stronger link to the Dem establishment, and therefore more credibility,' the source told the news site.

'She will help convince them Mike is not a quasi-Republican after he heavily backed GOP candidates in the past.'

According to the source, Marshall will also be able to help Bloomberg reach women and the African American community, 'which remains unsatisfied with his apology over his stop-and-frisk policy as New York City mayor'.

It is unclear what position Marshall would be taking under the Bloomberg campaign.

'Hiring Capricia is a very smart move. She’s a big deal,' the source said. Marshall has previously served both Clintons and the Obama administration.

From 1997 to 2001, she worked as Bill Clinton's White House social secretary. In 2006, she served on then-Senator Hillary Clinton's re-election campaign. From 2009 to 2013, Marshall worked as the chief of protocol of the United States under Obama.

News of Marshall possibly joining the Bloomberg campaign comes just a day after it was reported that the former mayor may be considering making Hillary Clinton his running mate.

Polling found the Bloomberg-Clinton combination would be a formidable force to take on Trump in the race for the White House.

Former New York City Mayor Bloomberg is said to be considering even changing his official residence from New York to Colorado or Florida because the electoral college makes it difficult for a US president and vice-president to reside in the same state

Bloomberg is said to be considering even changing his official residence from New York to Colorado or Florida - where he also has homes - because the electoral college makes it difficult for the president and vice-president to reside in the same state.

Under the Twelfth Amendment to the US Constitution, which provides the procedure for electing the president and vice-president, it states that the two people could not both inhabit the same state as the elector.

Former first lady Clinton previously said she faced calls to run for president in 2020 after she lost out to Trump in the 2016 election, but she has repeatedly said she won't join the race.

However, she stopped short of denying she was considering running for vice-president alongside one of the Democratic candidates earlier this month.

'I never say never because I do believe in serving my country, but it's not going to happen,' she told Ellen DeGeneres.

In January, President Donald Trump made the strange claim that Clinton had promised Bloomberg the job of secretary of state should she be elected president in 2016, to keep him from running four years ago.

'He had a deal with Hillary Clinton that he was going to become secretary of State. It was very simple. People knew that,' Trump said during an interview on CNBC filmed on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

The president then suggested Bloomberg would have been double-crossed.

'Wasn't going to happen. It was going to go to Terry McAuliffe,' Trump said, name-dropping the former governor of Virginia who's been a close Clinton friend.

'I mean, so they were playing with Michael,' Trump alleged. 'And - it's too bad, but he's spending a fortune.'

Bloomberg had endorsed Clinton over Trump in 2016, saying at the Democratic National Convention in July 2016 that though 'there are times when I disagree with Hillary,' the country must unite to 'defeat a dangerous demagogue'.

'Let's elect a sane, competent person with international experience,' Bloomberg said at the time.

Last week was a busy one for Bloomberg after he was forced to apologize for a recording that was leaked online of him talking bluntly about his stop-and-frisk policies.

'Ninety-five percent of your murders - murderers and murder victims - fit one M.O. You can just take the description, Xerox it and pass it out to all the cops,' Bloomberg is heard saying in the recording.

'They are male minorities, 16 to 25. That's true in New York. That's true in virtually every city.'

'And that's where the real crime is. You've got to get the guns out of the hands of the people that are getting killed.'

Trump tweeted: 'WOW, BLOOMBERG IS A TOTAL RACIST!'

On Thursday, Bloomberg apologized for endorsing the stop-and-frisk policy.

'There is one aspect of approach that I deeply regret, the abuse of police practice called stop and frisk,' Bloomberg said.

'I defended it, looking back, for too long because I didn't understand then the unintended pain it was causing to young black and brown families and their kids.'

'I should have acted sooner and faster to stop it,' he continued. 'I didn't, and for that, I apologize.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8019625/Hillary-Clinton-says-waiting-watching-amid-Bloomberg-vice-president-rumors.html

Omar Elomar, 18, was gunned down outside a park on Cabramatta Avenue at Miller, in Sydney's south-west, about 11.10pm on Saturday.

But Daily Mail Australia can now reveal Omar wasn't the initial target of the shooting - rather, the assassins were after his 15-year-old cousin.

Relatives said a fight broke out between Omar's cousin, his friends and children from another school near Miller Park earlier on Saturday.

As tensions escalated, calls went out for backup and a number of older relatives soon arrived at the scene, with saw the confrontation explode.

Witnesses claim one of the older relatives pointed a gun at Omar's cousin and pulled the trigger, but the weapon misfired.

Omar told him: 'Quick, run'.

Witnesses said the gunman then turned to Omar and shot him in the chest, before he and other members of his group fled in a stolen car.

NSW Police remain on the hunt for his killer, with the homicide squad having taken over the investigation.

'Anyone who knew this beautiful soul knew how happy and amazing he was, his smile could light up any dark room.'

The teenager's death gained additional attention because of his relation to a number of criminals including former ISIS fighter Mohamed Elomar.

Ibrahim Elomar and his brother Mamdouh, the father of Mohamed and Ahmed, were sentenced to 20 months in prison for trying to bribe officials to receive construction contracts. They were released from jail in mid-2019.

The shooting happened directly outside the home of Raed Kalal, who told The Daily Telegraph he tried in vain to perform CPR on the teenager.

'I've heard a gunshot, ran out, called the ambulance, started doing CPR and the bloke died straight away and that was it,' Mr Kalal said.

Support for coal-fired power among Coalition voters has dropped from 72 to 57 per cent, according to a poll by the Australian National University.

Responding to the poll, Mr Latham said it 'wasn't worth a cracker' and criticised alternative sources of electricity during an appearance on Sky News on Tuesday.

'Anyone who wants to take that 80 per cent of coal-fired power and think within the space of 20 or 30 years you can turn it into zero and rely on unproven technologies like battery storage or very expensive alternatives like pumped hydro to keep the lights on, well, they're dreaming,' Mr Latham said.

NSW One Nation leader Mark Latham said Australians who want to reduce coal-fired power by 80 per cent by 2050 are 'dreaming' during a Sky News appearance on Tuesday

Mr Latham incorrectly claimed New Zealand found it would take a 16 per cent GDP hit by going to net zero emissions by 2050.

He suggested Australia would lose 25 per cent off its GDP because it had more manufacturing industries.

'People want and need the money in their pocket instead of going down the path of experimental energy policy,' Mr Latham said.

What NZ actually found was that it would cost 16 per cent of its GDP to implement the changes.

Meanwhile, Sky News host Rita Panah claimed Australia would 'descend into a third world nation' if it cut out coal.

'We know renewables and batteries aren't going to be a replacement for that 80 per cent,' she said.

'Unless you've got something that can replace it like nuclear [power] then you're in a world of trouble.'

ANU lead researcher Professor Nicholas Biddle said non-capital city residents and those in capital cities 'shared the same view' in regard to environmental issues.

521,Arsenic contamination leaves small town left without clean drinking water for THREE MONTHS,"['Tita Smith', 'Tita Smith For Daily Mail Australia']","A country town has been forced to drink bottled water for the past three months after the supply was contaminated with arsenic.

Residents in Uralla, in the New South Wales Northern Tablelands, were left without clean drinking water on December 18 last year after unsafe levels of arsenic were detected in Kentucky Dam.

The pollutant, which is present in the ground, is believed to have seeped into the water as drought conditions dwindled the supply down to the floor of the damn.

The levels were four times the Australian Drinking Water Guideline limit of arsenic consumption when they were first discovered.

On Monday, one section of the creek was measured at 12 times the recommended concentration levels of arsenic.

Uralla, in New South Wales Northern Tablelands, has been forced to drink bottled water since December after unsafe levels of arsenic were detected in the town's water supply

The state government has been spending $5000 a day on bottled water for the town of around 2800 people since the crisis began.

Residents who have been advised to use bottled water for drinking, food preparation, making ice, cleaning teeth and gargling, are growing increasingly frustrated with no-end date to the saga in sight.

Arsenic can cause diabetes, acute gastrointestinal and neurological disorders, skin discoloration and the development of several types of cancer.

'It's just frustrating, there's a strong feeling in the community that they are frustrated it hasn't been fixed,' Northern Tablelands MP Adam Marshall told the Northern Daily Leader.

'They feel there are mixed reports about the extent of the problem, what's being done and what can be done to resolve the problem.

'We'll have plenty of time to go through the entrails and read the tea leaves, but I want to get things fixed. I'm as frustrated as anyone.'

The Uralla Shire Council released a statement on Wednesday warning residents not to drink from the tap

Uralla Shire Council general manager David Aber told Daily Mail Australia it was an unprecedented issue for the treatment facility plant as three species of arsenic had been discovered.

Mr Aber said the council has drafted a funding proposal to the state government to make filtration modifications to the plant but he could not confirm how long the process would take.

Once it is approved, the modifications will take three to four weeks to be installed.

Much-needed rain over the past two weeks filled the water catchment to 100 per cent on Tuesday.

'We need to work carefully to ensure that we have a robust practical solution to the problem that will provide future protection as well as meet our immediate needs'

'Any solution will be subject to detailed testing before implementation.

522,"Personal trainer, 31, shares the five signs you're 'skinny fat'","['Matilda Rudd', 'Matilda Rudd For Daily Mail Australia']","A personal trainer has outlined the major health problems associated with being 'skinny fat' and the weekly exercise routine you need to follow to lower your body fat percentage.

The term 'skinny fat' describes a person who maintains a low body mass index (BMI) but who has high levels of body fat and low muscle mass - even though they appear slim in clothing.

Rachael Attard, who is based in Sydney, used her website to explain how the average person becomes 'skinny fat' and how you can reverse the damage with a specific diet and resistance training.

Rachael Attard (pictured), who is based in Sydney, has used her website to explain how the average person becomes 'skinny fat'

Rachael shared her own 'skinny fat' transformation on her website (pictured)

'Skinny fat is a result of losing muscle mass (which lowers your metabolic rate) and adding fat by eating the same calories usually from unhealthy food sources (with a lower metabolic rate),' the 31-year-old fitness instructor said.

'You may maintain the same weight, go slightly above, or even lower in weight but it's mainly fat, not muscle.'

What are the five signs you're skinny fat? 1. Excessive amounts of cardio and no weight training. 2. Poor diet high in carbs and refined sugars. 3. You have a genetic disposition to be skinny fat. 4. You have hormonal issues. 5. You've done extreme diets before.

WHAT CAUSES YOU TO BECOME SKINNY FAT?

People who are obsessed with doing large quantities of cardio - and very little resistance work - may become skinny fat because they aren't building enough muscle to keep their body fat percentage down.

This, combined with a poor diet that is high in carbohydrates and refined sugars, will cause you to store excess bodyweight in the midsection - a common 'look' associated with being skinny fat.

Some people are genetically predisposed to the condition and will actively need to work on changing their body fat to muscle ratio.

'I should also mention that in some cases skinny fat people struggle because of a range of health conditions, which include hypothyroidism (unusually low hormone production), hormone imbalances, certain medications (such as the contraceptive pill) and gut health issues,' Rachael said.

Finally there is the case of extreme dieting whereby someone has lost a lot of weight by dramatically cutting their calorie intake, but weren't exercising at the same time.

WHAT ARE THE DANGERS?

Having a high body fat percentage can come with just as many risks for a 'skinny' person as it can for someone who is classed as obese.

These include diabetes, high bloody pressure, blood sugar levels and high cholesterol levels.

But the associated health problems don't have to become your reality, as Rachael said there are ways to transform your body from 'skinny fat' to toned in weeks.

Having a high body fat percentage can come with just as many risks for a 'skinny' person as it can for someone who is classed as obese

Rachael said one or two days of full body resistance training, one or two days of HIIT, one or two days of high-intensity cardio and one or two days of rest should be enough to reverse the damage

WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT?

'For skinny fat people who want to tone up and lose a bit of excess body fat, you will need to do a combination of resistance training and cardio,' Rachael said.

How can you reduce your carb intake? 1. Switch any white carbs (i.e. bread, rice) to brown and wholemeal varieties. 2. Eat more carbs on your workout days and fewer carbs on your rest days. 3. Try to eat most of your carbs at breakfast or post workout. 4. Aim to get most of your carbs from fruit, vegetables and whole grains.

She recommends High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) for sufferers of the skinny fat look because it burns a high number of calories and builds muscle through bodyweight exercises.

Rachael said one or two days of full body resistance training, one or two days of HIIT, one or two days of high-intensity cardio and one or two days of rest should be enough to reverse the damage.

Alongside this you'll need to remove all processed foods from your diet - or keep it to a minimum - follow a low-carb diet and aim for five vegetables a day.

The majority of your carb intake should come from fruit, vegetables and wholegrains.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8017913/Personal-trainer-31-shares-five-signs-youre-skinny-fat.html
523,Mother shares the unusual ingredient she used to cook the perfect chicken schnitzel,"['Cindy Tran', 'Cindy Tran For Daily Mail Australia']","Mother said she used pancake mix to cook the perfect chicken schnitzel for her family

A mother has revealed the unusual ingredient she used to cook the perfect chicken schnitzel for her family.

Australian woman Barbara said she was planning to cook dinner when she realised she was missing breadcrumbs and flour from her pantry.

But instead of rushing back to the supermarket, she decided to be improvise what she already had in her cupboard - pancake mix.

After soaking the chicken breast fillets in a bowl of salt and milk for an hour in the fridge, she coated the meat with eggs and dried pancake mix.

'It was a perfect blend of savoury and subtle sweet. My kids have asked me to make it again for Friday night dinner and hubby agreed,' she said in an Aldi Facebook group.

She started the cooking method by slicing the chicken horizontally so they are roughly around one centimetre thick.

'First I sliced the chicken breast fillets as thin as I could - close to 1cm. I put the cut fillets into a bowl with salt and milk, covered with cling wrap and put in fridge for a few hours,' she said.

After soaking the chicken breast fillets in a bowl of salt and milk for an hour in the fridge, she coated the meat with eggs and dried pancake mix (stock image)

'Once I took chicken out of the fridge and realised I didn't have any breadcrumbs, I made an egg wash of two eggs and the milk from the bowl.

'Emptied the contents of the pancake shake onto a plate. I dipped the chicken into the egg wash and then straight into the dry pancake mix.'

Many parents were impressed with her creation, while others suggested the flavour combination surprisingly works for the savoury dish.

'Wow I never would have even thought of that! Legend Mama,' one said.

Another said: 'Looks amazing. I had a similar dilemma. We were going to have crumbed chicken drumsticks, but I didn't have any ingredients. So I just dipped the chicken in egg and crushed some nacho chips up and voila! Kids gave it a 10 out of 10.'

Others said the combination with chicken was no different to other meals such as pancakes with bacon, fried chicken with waffles and mushroom chicken with crepes.

'At first I thought yuk but if it's like fried chicken and waffles, I'm up for it lol,' one mother said.

Another said: 'Has no one had mushroom chicken crepes before? I wanna try this now.'

And one woman revealed: 'I use pancake mix to make vegetable fritters - just add veggies and eggs.'

While some were not on board with the chicken schnitzel and pancake coating.

'What made you even think of pancake mix to have with chicken? The thought makes me heave but I guess I can't knock it as I haven't tried it,' one woman said.

Last week, an Australian mother has shared the secret to cooking the perfect roast potatoes

The recipe requires a dried packet of French onion soup mix, which costs just 95 cents

The unusual ingredient comes just days after a mother revealed the secret to cooking the perfect roast potatoes involved an unlikely ingredient.

She said all you need is potatoes and a dried packet of French onion soup mix, which costs just 95 cents.

'When doing roast spuds, peel, cut and place in a baking dish then get French Onion dry soup mix and sprinkle over top of spuds,' she said in a Facebook group.

Next, she drizzles oil over the top and then places the tray into the oven to bake.

'It's the only way I do roast spuds now,' she said.

'It's the bomb my mum taught me.'

Many were amazed by the simple recipe, while others said they have been using this method for years.

Some suggested using Vegeta stock powder instead of the French onion mix because it 'tastes better'.

'Never seen a storm like this before,' one Twitter user from the city's west said. 'Non-stop lightning and thunder for over an hour. Power has gone off.'

Commuters were affected as a huge clean-up operation began. The North Shore Line was delayed by a fallen tree near Pymble and the Northern Line was held up by a fallen tree in Thornleigh.

Endeavour Energy said electricity cuts were affecting 24,000 of its customers after power lines were brought down in northwest Sydney and the Hawkesbury region on Tuesday night, with 270 electrical hazards needing repairs.

Emergency workers had ideal conditions as Sydney was sunny with a forecast top of 29C for Wednesday after the storm passed but in other parts of NSW cooler weather conditions are expected as a cold front moved up from from the southeast.

A dry air mass means southern parts of NSW could have temperatures drop below 20C, particularly in the Southern Ranges and South Coast region.

Western NSW regions were not expected to have any significant rainfall over the next few days.

Several flights coming into Sydney were also turned around, unable to land due to the chaotic weather.

'I figured there was no point trying to be fake about the situation,' Amanda, 34, said.

The final supper: After weeks of bickering, Married At First Sight's lesbian brides Amanda Micallef and Tash Herz reached breaking point at Wednesday's dinner party

'I don't feel the need to walk in as friends... Let's take off the mask and let's cut the bulls**t,' she continued.

Tash, 31, was less than impressed with the arrangement, fuming over her runaway bride as she drove to the dinner party alone.

'I would never have made her walk into this by herself,' Tash said. 'Passive aggressive s**t... she will regret her behaviour.'

'I would never have made her walk into this by herself!' Tash was stunned after a producer informed her that Amanda had requested they arrive to the dinner party separately

Amanda didn't hold back once she arrived to the party, quickly getting into an argument with Hayley Vernon, who was on Tash's side.

After Hayley, 32, continued to lecture Amanda about her relationship, the strength coach eventually ended the conversation and vented to producers behind the scenes.

'Hayley hasn't given me the time of day since I've been here, so to feel that this Amazon was coming at me on the couch, I was ready to knock her out,' she seethed.

Amanda remained outspoken during dinner, telling anybody who would listen about her disastrous marriage to Tash.

'I just can't be bothered being fake,' Amanda said. 'There's no friendship there with her and I.'

'She will regret her behaviour': Tash was frustrated by how Amanda was acting

Luke reportedly acknowledged the incident took place at the time, and Poppy is now speaking with lawyers to determine what she can say publicly.

Extraordinary claims: Poppy Jennings is reportedly seeking legal advice following her departure from Married At First Sight. Pictured with Luke Eglin on their wedding day

Susie claimed: '[Poppy] needs to have an understanding of what she can and can't say. She has been told by producers that she can't come forward because of what has gone on, and how controversial it is to the show.

'It's all about the show, no one is really caring about how she is feeling. Something happened to her that made her feel uncomfortable, and everybody has just brushed it off like it's not important.'

According to Susie, Poppy had informed producers of an alleged incident with Luke, but they told her she could not speak about it.

Legal: Luke reportedly acknowledged the incident took place at the time, and Poppy is now speaking with lawyers to determine what she can say publicly

Susie continued: 'She definitely told producers, and they just said, ""Poppy, you can't come forward with this as it's way too controversial for the show.""

'They've made her out like she's left him for no reason, and she just doesn't like him and misses her kids. This is not correct at all.'

When asked how Poppy is doing now, Susie said: 'She's not well, I'll tell you that. She has not been well since she left the show.

'She tells me she can't sleep and is having night tremors [sic]. I tell her not to stress about it and that everything will be okay. She's so upset about how everything went down and that she can't be herself. It has affected her.

'If anybody actually knew her, she's the most realest person you'll ever meet.'

'Too controversial for the show': According to Susie, Poppy had informed producers of an alleged incident with Luke, but they told her she could not speak about it

Earlier in the show, Kyle and Jackie O had spoken to Poppy and Luke's MAFS co-star Connie Crayden, who refused to say much about the matter.

'Alright, yeah... it's a touchy one, this one. I don't, I just don't feel comfortable, really, giving too much of my opinion on this because... I guess, you know, it is big and it's something that Poppy and Luke need to deal with themselves,' she said.

'Yeah, inappropriate is one word to use [to describe what happened], definitely. It's just, yeah... just, it's heavy.'

Her lips are sealed: Earlier in the show, Kyle and Jackie had spoken to Poppy and Luke's MAFS co-star Connie Crayden (pictured), who refused to say much about the matter

It comes after Poppy shared a viral Facebook post on Tuesday in which she claimed that she 'wasn't allowed to speak' about the incident.

'I was uncomfortable with all the things about this person I was matched with that didn't add up!' she wrote.

Poppy also claimed that Luke's bosses had spoken to him before his appearance on the show, warning him to be 'on his best behaviour'.

'You have seen minutes of footage here and there of a guy on his best behaviour because he was drilled by his bosses beforehand about how he had to behave!' she added.

According to Poppy, there were incidents that happened during filming that were 'too controversial' to be shown on television.

Speaking out: It comes after Poppy shared a viral Facebook post on Tuesday in which she claimed that she 'wasn't allowed to speak' about the incident

'I couldn't say what was happening behind the scenes, as it was too controversial, so let's just play her ugly crying and whinging over her kids,' she wrote.

'F**k, I'd probably hate me too! From what I heard that's all they play of me!'

During her time on MAFS, Poppy had often complained about missing her two-year-old twin sons, who were staying in Wollongong with her mother.

She also claimed that Luke wasn't genuinely upset when she left the experiment, and was more concerned about what she would say about him.

In his defence: Before Susie's interview with The Kyle and Jackie O Show, Luke had downplayed the incident in a statement to The Daily Telegraph

'Why is Luke crying when I left? What really happened that he was crying over! You don't know because I wasn't allowed to say! It's too controversial!' she continued.

'He's scared s**tless I will tell the truth. I was afraid to speak up! But f**k this s**t, I'm going to tell everything!

'It's not what you see, it's what you don't see! Go and ask Luke why I was so uncomfortable? Why the f**k did I really leave?

'He's petrified I'm going to talk. He knows he's f**ked up. Those tears from him are for his reputation and job!'

She concluded her post by saying that Luke needed to be held 'accountable'.

Moving on: Luke, a 39-year-old FIFO worker and father-of-two, told The Daily Telegraph, 'I am not going to make any comments because, honestly, the best way to react is not to react'

'Honestly, she just needs to move on like I have and that is it. We are finished on the show and that is as far as it goes.'

The last word? Poppy's Facebook post, which had attracted more than 10,000 comments before it was deleted on Tuesday afternoon, included wild accusations about her ex-'husband'

Luke, who works offshore as a maintenance supervisor, also told the Geelong Advertiser: 'The best response is not to respond. There's nothing I want to comment on because there's no point [in] making extra accusations.'

Locals are hoping the water will continue to flow down the Barwon-Darling River to Menindee Lakes.

But there are fears a pumping embargo that was recently put in place by the New South Wales Government may be lifted after the heavy rainfall.

The embargo stopped irrigators from extracting water from the rivers to farm storages but was lifted for three days.

The embargo is expected to end by February 27 but Brewarrina locals are desperate to have it extended.

'By February 27 the river will be at its peak in Bourke,' Brewarrina Shire Council mayor Phil O'Connor told the ABC.

'If irrigators there are allowed to access the water at that time, we'll see the guts of this river go right down.

'The people downstream deserve a lot better than that.'

Families across Australia were burdoned by the drought that left many farmers without money and livestock.

A farmer from Tamworth previously spoke to Daily Mail Australia about the catastrophic weather event, which forced him to sell his 200 head of cattle.

'This is the worst drought I have seen in 40 years. Droughts come and go but this one is severe,' the farmer said.

His property was littered with the carcasses of dead cows, with some perishing in the mud as they tried to get water from dried up damns.

In 2018, the Australian government pledged a $190million drought package to provide relief for the affected farming communities.

The New South Wales government also pledged up to $1billion of drought relief measures and subsidies for farmers.

Not even public servants are immune, with their salaries last year increasing by just 2.2 per cent.

The was the weakest pay increase on record since the Australian Bureau of Statistics began its wage price index series in late 1997.

Private sector workers also had little to cheer about, with their salaries also rising by just 2.2 per cent in the year to late December, new figures showed.

Australian pay levels have failed to rise about the three per cent level since mid-2013 and are well below the four per cent pace during the mining construction boom of more than a decade ago.

CommSec senior economist Ryan Felsman linked high immigration levels with curtailed wage increases.

'So why is wage inflation contained, despite strong job creation? The simple answer is that Australia has an excess supply of workers,' he said.

'Population growth remains elevated and workforce participation has lifted to record highs, driven by a surge in females and older Aussies.'

Australia's net immigration pace for 2019, with departures factored in, stood at 294,310, ABS data released on Tuesday showed.

While that annual tally was below the all-time high of 353,480 set in April 2009, it was still more than triple the 20th century average of 70,000, which had lasted until the late 1990s.

Journalists suffered an more lacklustre pay increases than shop assistants, factory and construction workers, whose salaries all rose by 1.8 per cent.

A handful of industries offered slightly above-average rises, with health care workers enjoying an annual pay increase of 3.1 per cent.

Carissa Santiano, based in Sydney, Australia, weighed 127 kilos before she decided to overhaul her life and cut out soft drink for good, halving her weight in the process.

The 37-year-old says the significant drop in kilos has helped 'cure' her depression and given her confidence back, even finding love with a new partner in the process.

Carissa Santiano, based in Sydney, Australia, weighed 127 kilos before she decided to overhaul her life and cut out soft drink for good, halving her weight in the process

'People never gave me the time of day when I was big, I was called ugly and fat every day,' she said.

'It makes you feel absolutely worthless and you start to believe what everyone is saying, I had almost given up on myself.'

Carissa would frequently start her day with soft drink and sip on four litres over the course of the day. On top of that she was eating calorie-laden chocolates, chips and takeaway.

'I would have takeaway for lunch every day but when I stopped doing that, I still wasn't losing any weight,' she said.

Carissa would frequently start her day with soft drink and sip on four litres over the course of the day before she cut out some of her salty snacks

'My doctor advised me to cut out fizzy drinks because although I was eating bad, it was the amount of sugar in the drinks I was having that was doing the most damage.

'Once I stopped drinking fizzy drinks everything changed, I could still eat sandwiches and junk food, as long as I didn't drink fizzy drinks I still lost weight.'

But she did tidy up her plate as a result of her new, healthier body, cutting out a few salty snacks along with the soft drink she had relied on.

'I think it's something we overlook as people trying to lose weight. You just think it's always food that's the problem but I'm living proof that you can enjoy the food you love and still remain healthy,' she said.

'Once I stopped drinking fizzy drinks everything changed, I could still eat sandwiches and junk food, as long as I didn't drink fizzy drinks I still lost weight,' she said

Carissa had suffered for years from low confidence - which pulled her into a depression - as a result of her size.

Although the process was often difficult she stressed that it's possible to have 'cheat days' or 'take time off' and still make progress.

'I was unknowingly drinking double the amount of sugar I should've had per day,' she said.

Carissa is sharing her story in the hope it inspires others to just make the first step and kick their bad habits, without taking things to the extreme.

PR expert Mark Borkowski told the Mirror: 'This does not surprise me at all.'

Meanwhile a banking insider told the publication: 'Harry and Meghan have set a clear path to work with big banks and corporate giants as well as doing altruistic work with charities.

'The mix works well with the target audience and the celebrity set. However, it is sure to raise eyebrows in royal circles.

'It has echoes of other royals criticised for touting themselves to the highest bidder and all becomes rather tawdry.'

It comes after Harry, 35, and Meghan's first post-Megxit appearance earlier this month was at an event held by US banking giant JP Morgan in Miami - an organisation which has been embroiled in a succession of controversies.

Experts claim the Sussexes could make up to £1billion if they network correctly with delegates and sign a combination of corporate deals and roles as brand ambassadors

JP Morgan was among the group of big American investment banks blamed for triggering the financial crisis just over a decade ago – and was eventually ordered to pay a then-record $13 billion fine – about £10 billion – in 2013 for misleading investors in the years leading up to the meltdown.

Coincidentally, 2013 was also the year the bank finally parted company with one of its most notorious clients, paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.

Last week it emerged Prince Harry's team held talks with Goldman Sachs - an investment bank accused by the US government and senate of misleading investors about the value of subprime mortgages and contributing to the financial crisis.

Other controversies have ranged from being linked to the 1MDB fraud and a lawsuit brought by former female employees to the bank's role in the financial crisis.

539,Prince Andrew's 60th birthday is marked with Royal Family Instagram post,"['Stephanie Linning', 'Stephanie Linning For Mailonline']","The Queen and the Duchess of York have paid tribute to Prince Andrew as he celebrates his 60th birthday under the cloud of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.

The official Royal Family Instagram account offered a public show of support for Andrew, widely considered to be the Queen's 'favourite' son, by sharing two photos: a childhood snap of the prince and a new formal portrait.

The caption reads: 'On this day in 1960, Prince Andrew was born at Buckingham Palace, the first child born to a reigning monarch for 103 years. Happy Birthday to The Duke of York.'

Meanwhile Sarah Ferguson, 60, shared a photo of her ex-husband relaxing at home with two dogs, alongside an unusually subdued message.

The posts are a glimmer of normality on what will otherwise be a day of muted celebrations for Andrew, one far removed from the fanfare typically enjoyed by senior royals on their milestone birthdays.

The Royal Family also shared this new formal portrait of the Duke of York to mark the birthday

The post, pictured, is a glimmer of normality on what will otherwise be a day of muted celebrations far removed from the fanfare typically enjoyed by royals on milestone birthdays

Government buildings will not be required to fly the Union flag to mark his birthday and he will not promoted to admiral, as was planned.

There will also be no dazzling party at Buckingham Palace, although there will be a small family dinner at Royal Lodge, his home in Windsor Great Park, for about a dozen, including Fergie and their daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.

The bells of Westminster Abbey will still ring out in celebration as it is a Royal Peculiar, a place of worship that falls under the jurisdiction of the monarch rather than a bishop.

The pared back celebrations are a far cry from Andrew's 50th.

Andrew's ex-wife Sarah Ferguson shared this photo of the prince on Instagram today

The Duchess of York posted an uncharacteristically restrained caption to accompany the snap

By then, his association with Jeffrey Epstein — the disgraced U.S. financier who was found dead in a New York prison cell last August — was well known, but it failed to deter a string of glamorous women from attending the Duke's birthday bash, which was held over a weekend at St James's Palace.

Why the flags won't fly for Andrew's birthday Government buildings will not be required to fly the Union flag to mark Andrew's 60th birthday, following his decision to step back from public duties, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has said. Ahead of the milestone the Union flag tribute was branded 'crass and offensive' by Graham Smith of Republic, which campaigns for an elected head of state. Downing Street said earlier this month the issue of flying the national flag in tribute was being looked at. A Culture department spokesman said: 'Following the decision by the Duke of York to step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, there is no longer a requirement for UK Government buildings to fly the Union flag on Wednesday February 19.' The announcement is unlikely to have a significant effect as many Government buildings, such as UK embassies or Government department offices, already fly the Union flag every day of the year and are expected to continue to do so. Local authorities have the discretion whether to fly the Union flag on any given day.

Partygoers included Catrina Skepper, the one-time Pretty Polly and Cadbury's Flake model, as well as socialite Caroline Stanbury, who subsequently appeared on reality TV show Ladies Of London, and Kazakh-born socialite Goga Ashkenazi.

The Duke of York also gave a TV interview, in which he discussed criticisms levelled against his extravagant lifestyle.

Andrew's birthday comes on what has been a difficult week for his mother the Queen, with her nephew David Linley announcing his divorce from wife Serena, and her grandson Peter Phillips revealing he has separated from his wife Autumn.

The monarch, 93, has also had to manage the Duke and Duchess of Sussexes' recent departure, and the Duke of York's decision to step back from royal duties in the wake of his disastrous Newsnight interview.

The duke faced a backlash after the interview with critics accusing him of failing to show regret over his friendship with the disgraced financier, and empathy with his victims.

Virginia Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked by Epstein, also alleges the duke had sex with her on three separate occasions, including when she was 17, still a minor under US law.

Andrew, who strenuously denies the allegations, has faced calls to talk to the FBI and US prosecutors still investigating Epstein, who committed suicide in jail while facing sex trafficking charges.

But they said her habits are now 'rubbing off' on Prince Harry, as the couple adapt to life on the West Coast.

The Duke and Duchess have been residing in the opulent £10million [$14million] Vancouver Island mansion they have used since American Thanksgiving last year.

The source said while Meghan was cooking for the family, Prince Harry had also picking up his wife's favourite hobby and enjoying a healthier diet as a result.

The Duke of Sussex has adopted some of his wife's 'healthy habits' following their move to the West Coast (pictured together in October 2018 during their tour of Australia)

The source added: 'Being able to hike with friends, Archie, and their dogs in Canada is a simple pleasure that they love.'

Earlier this week, it emerged the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have axed all 15 of their staff and closed their Buckingham Palace office.

It is the surest sign yet that the couple and their son Archie, who turns one in May, are unlikely ever to return to the UK to live.

The couple are believed to be enjoying life in Canada as they take long walks and practise yoga together (pictured, Meghan in 2017)

The couple also paid a visit to the prestigious Stanford University in Palo Alto, California.

Their decision to work with academics at a university in California increased speculation about whether the couple plans to relocate to the West Coast permanently.

A source previously told People magazine how the Duke and Duchess felt 'a weight had been lifted off their shoulders' after deciding to step back from the royal family.

Another source revealed how quickly the couple had adapted to life outside Britain, saying: 'They are enjoying living a quiet life...They are real homebodies who love to chill out with Archie and the dogs.'

541,"Sarah Ristevski's body language revealed why she stood by her father, expert says","['Karen Ruiz', 'Brittany Chain For Daily Mail Australia']","Sarah Ristevski displayed a 'contempt for police' during her recent bombshell interview that may have indicated why she chose to stand by her father, despite him killing her mum.

Sarah spoke about Karen Ristevski's death for the first time on Channel Nine's 60 Minutes on Sunday, nearly four years after dad Borce killed her at their Melbourne home and dumped her body in bushland.

Borce feigned innocence, lied to the police, the public and his daughter, until suddenly admitting to manslaughter on the eve of his murder trial in 2019.

The 24-year-old admitted she found it difficult to accept that her father was guilty and that despite his plea, she has always and will continue to love him.

But leading body language expert Sophie Zadeh revealed the pivotal moment in the interview where Sarah's expressions gave away why she's supporting her killer dad.

Scroll down for video

The crucial moment: While talking about the early stages of the investigation, Sarah's expressions indicated a contempt for authorities, which may be why she chose to stick by her dad, body language expert Sophie Zadeh revealed

Borce Ristevski and his daughter Sarah in 2016 before he was convicted of killing his wife

At one point in the interview, she spoke about the early stages of the investigation, when her father had gone to police to report her mother missing.

She explained the attending officer was 'rude' and suggested Karen was 'probably at the pokies'.

'My mum doesn't play the pokies,' Sarah said she responded.

'At this point, Sarah's eyes narrow. This facial movement stems from the emotion of anger. She gasps for breath and cries. Her emotion flits between sadness and distress,' Ms Zadeh explained to Yahoo News.

'What we can take from this part of the interview is something we shouldn't ignore. This is Sarah expressing genuine and extreme emotion as she recalls her initial interaction with the police. This is where she formed her opinion that they were the enemy.'

Sarah might have reacted differently to her father's guilty plea, had police officers established a level trust among them from the beginning, Ms Zadeh claimed.

The My Alcomy founder also pointed to another significant moment in the interview in which Sarah shows she's not ready to fully accept reality.

Sarah broke down as she explained the attending officer was 'rude' and suggested Karen was 'probably at the pokies' when she went missing

Dress shop owner Karen disappeared from the family home in Avondale Heights, north-west Melbourne, on June 29, 2016. Pictured with Borce and Sarah

She tells reporter Liz Hayes she wants people to know she is more than just the woman who lost her mum.

'The emotion of sadness stems from loss and while Sarah is still grieving for her mother, she is now also grieving for her father and fears for the future,' Ms Zadeh said.

During the interview, Sarah admitted she didn't like to talk about what happened to her mother.

'We don't talk about it. We don't think about it,' she said during the interview, at times fighting back tears.

'Even though he's pleaded guilty I find it hard to comprehend that he is guilty. I think if he were in my position he would support me.'

Miss Ristevski said Borce would have her continued support when he was freed from prison.

'He's my father. I have one parent left... I loved him before, I love him now and I'll love him in 11 years when he's home,' she said.

'When you're in my position, I think when your mind is all over the place – different things (like) how my mum died. It's not on my… I just can't go there.

Borce Ristevski, 55, killed his wife Karen (left) at their home Avondale Heights, Melbourne, in June 2016, before dumping her body in a regional park. Pictured with their daughter Sarah, who was 21 at the time

Borce Ristevski (pictured) was a pallbearer at the funeral of his wife Karen in March 2017

'My heart is saying, I can't comprehend. I can't think about why my mum died.'

While she stood by the wife-killer, who last year shocked Australia with an 11th hour guilty plea to manslaughter, a renowned psychologist believes Miss Ristevski is under her father's spell.

Criminal behavioural analyst Laura Richards told the program Miss Ristevski's unwavering support suggests she has been manipulated.

'I believe that Sarah has been in a bubble, in a vacuum, in a highly unusual situation, he's the one in her ear constantly,' she said.

Karen was killed by her husband at their home Avondale Heights, Melbourne, in June 2016.

He feigned innocence, lied to the police, the public and his daughter, and even carried his wife's coffin at her funeral, until admitting to manslaughter on the eve of his murder trial in 2019.

In the 60 Minutes interview, which reportedly earned her a six figure pay packet, Miss Ristevski said she 'wouldn't go there' when further pressed on her father's guilt.

But Ms Richards believes Miss Ristevski will one day come to terms with what her father did to her mother - and all that he deprived her of in the process.

'As contact lessens between [Borce] and [Sarah], as her relationships strengthen with other people, [she] will think of things in a very different way. ''How could he have done this? How could he deprive me of my mother?'' And suddenly these emotions come to the fore. And I believe that that will happen,' she said.

The graphic designer still speaks with and visits her father in prison. She said they discussed her 60 Minutes interview - the first she's offered since her mother's death.

She denied she was 'under his spell' and said the interview was an opportunity to speak her truth.

Karen Ristevski's 24-year-old daughter Sarah has spoken publicly for the first time about her mother's brutal death

Pictured: Sarah with her father, Borce, as a young girl. She said she has always loved her father and always will

'He tells me I'm my own person and that's how he raised me. For the interview, he told me to just be truthful and be myself. That's all he asked,' she said.

Miss Ristevski famously stood by her father even when he pleaded guilty to killing her mother after three gruelling years of denying any involvement.

He has never offered any further details about her death.

She opted against providing the court a victim impact statement for the loss of her mother and instead offered a glowing character reference for her father to 'highlight the man she knows'.

The 24-year-old said she had no desire to help the officers who had been horrible to her by providing a victim impact statement, and said when she and her father initially tried to report her mother missing, they were dismissed by officers.

At the time, both she and her father were worried, but they were told Karen was likely 'playing the pokies' and to get in contact again if they hadn't heard from her by midnight.

Miss Ristevski also used the interview as an opportunity to rubbish rumours her step-brother had a romantic relationship with her mother.

'It could never be true... It is unforgivable,' she said of the claims before confirming she no longer has a relationship with her brother.

She has since insisted she can 'see the sadness [Borce feels] at the loss of my mum'.

'We both have the same amount of sadness. He loved my mum... He misses her every day,' she said while holding back tears.

Ristevski was jailed last April for at least six years after admitting to the manslaughter of his wife of 27 years.

Police revealed they had tapped phone conversations during the investigation which formed part of a 22,000-page evidence brief.

When Sarah asked her father where her mum was on the day of her disappearance, he told her she had gone for a walk after an argument. She said she could tell he was worried.

'I felt like we were just zombies, just not sleeping, not eating, we just paused in that day. It just felt like we were trapped in a nightmare,' Sarah told the program on Sunday night.

In December, Karen's family's appeal over the sentence was successful and Ristevski's jail term was extended to 13 years, ten without the chance for parole.

Miss Ristevski said despite her father serving a sentence, she feels like her life, too, has been put on hold.

'My dad is serving the time but I am as well... The realisation that I'm kind of alone.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8017689/Sarah-Ristevskis-body-language-revealed-stood-father-expert-says.html

Robbie Katter has called on the Queensland government to ship thousands of bats to NSW after the animals' numbers were decimated during the bushfire crisis.

Katter is among a handful of Queensland crossbench MPs who are adamant their idea to ship thousands of flying foxes to New South Wales is foolproof.

Towns and cities in the state's north are being overtaken by huge swarms of bats, while populations across the southern border have been ravaged by bushfires.

Robbie Katter, Bob Katter's son and now leader of the Katter Australian Party (KAP) says the solution is simple: send the Queensland bats south to ease the burden on fed-up residents, while topping up NSW numbers into the bargain.

Mr Katter has urged the state government to fund and approve a dispersal plan.

‘Dispersals like this are complex but I have personally spoken to professional contractors who could get on the ground now with a reasonable expectation of success,’ he said in a statement.

‘It is shameful that the Minister is presiding over this ecological crisis – if this was in the Botanical Gardens in Brisbane or along Southbank, the matter would have been addressed yesterday.’

Mr Katter urged the state government to tackle the issue as residents are being 'driven mad' by the influx of bats (stock)

The proposal comes after an influx of 150,000 red flying foxes was spotted in the Brisbane CBD – the second time it has happened in just three years.

This led to two local parks being closed, hours being limited at a local swimming pool, and the animals creating homes in trees around schools, aged care homes and private residences.

Mr Katter argued that waiting until April to disperse the bats until April was ‘unacceptable’ because residents are living in ‘terrible conditions’.

He blames the state government for slowing down the process because ‘councils do not have the resources to properly handle issues of this magnitude’.

Following a horror bushfire season from December to January, the city of Brisbane saw an influx of 250,000 bats descend upon Deception Bay, north of Brisbane, and a further 150,000 were seen at nearby Bongaree.

In Ingham, a small town in North Queensland, the bat population has soared with more than 300,000 creatures taking up residence.

Lahela, 9, and Noah, 7, travelled to Beirut with their father Ali Elamine for a holiday in May 2015 - and never returned.

Her case became famous 11 months later when she and a 60 Minutes crew tried to recover the children but were instead arrested by Lebanese police.

Ms Faulkner has since been pursuing a long and expensive custody battle, and said she recently had 'several wins' but was running out of money.

Sally Faulkner has renewed her fight to bring her two children Lahela, 9, and Noah, 7, back to Australia

The children travelled to Beirut with their father Ali Elamine for a holiday in May 2015 and never returned

The mother-of-four on Tuesday renewed her plea to see Lahela and Noah again and let them meet her two youngest children.

'We have already missed out on so much. Their rooms sit empty at the end of our hallway, ready for them to come home at any moment. To a life where they won't be deprived of either parent's love,' she wrote.

Ms Faulkner and Mr Elamine fell in love in 2008 when she was a flight attendant for Emirates and they had their first child in 2010.

They lived together as a family in Beirut until a car bomb exploded near their home in August 2013 and she returned to Brisbane with the children.

The distance between them ruined their marriage but Ms Faulkner said they remained amicable and Mr Elamine visited regularly, so she agreed they would visit Lebanon with him.

'Ali was a good father and the kids loved him, I trusted him and never thought he would take them away forever,' she wrote.

'Not long after arriving in Lebanon, Ali phoned me at home and told me that the kids would be staying with him and would never be returning to Australia.'

Ms Faulkner believed her ex-husband's change of heart arose from her new relationship with her now-fiance Brendan Pierce.

Four days later she discovered she was pregnant with her third child, Eli. She and Mr Pierce have since had another son together named Izac.

In another post this month, Ms Faulkner wrote to her eldest children about their two half-brothers she hopes they will one day meet.

'Your little brother Eli just turned four years old. We had a party at the park with all of our friends, and your cousins too,' she wrote.

'We talked about how good it would be if you were both here. We talk about you all the time and Eli often tells me stories with you both in it, he doesn't understand yet why he can't see you... but he loves you both so very much.

'Your little brother Izac is growing up too and although he can't say much yet, we will be making sure that your names are some of the first words he learns.

'Lahela, I can just imagine you picking him up all the time and making him laugh, like you always made Mummy laugh.'

Ms Faulkner said she agreed to the 60 Minutes child recovery plan because she was desperate, the Australian Government was no help, and the legal case was bleak.

'All I could hear were their little cries asking to come home. Ask yourself, what would you have done?' she wrote.

'I was driven by love and desperation and I was very unlucky that it didn't work out, however I would do it all over again if it meant that I had my children home with me today.'

'There have been so many tears and moments where we have spent hours talking about you and wishing you were both here.'

Mr Elamine has indicated he never plans to let his ex-wife see her children again and they are happier without her.

'I will do what I like regardless of what she says,' he said in 2018.

Ms Faulkner also apologised to her children for letting them end up in Lebanon, unable to leave and with the prospect of never seeing their mother again.

'If I knew back then what I know now, I would have never let you step foot on that plane. The one that left Brisbane carrying my entire life on board… and away from me,' she wrote.

553,Family-run chocolate company hits out after being forced to rename dozens of its products by Nestle,"['Tita Smith', 'Tita Smith For Daily Mail Australia']","Leanne and Ian Neeland (pictured) have been ordered to change the name of more than 20 of their confectionery

A family-run chocolate company has been forced to rename dozens of its products by confectionery giant Nestle over the trademarked term 'freckle'.

Leanne and Ian Neeland, from Yarra Glen in Victoria, were told by the multinational company to stop using the word to sell their sweets at their Yarra Valley Chocolaterie and Ice Creamery stores.

In July last year, Nestle issued a legal notice giving the couple three months to 'cease all use' of the term in their packaging because it was trademarked and might confuse customers.

The business owners must rebrand more than 20 products in their three stores across the Yarra Valley, Mornington Peninsula and Great Ocean Road.

'How can you own freckles? We’ve got freckles on our faces and we’ve been eating freckles for many, many years,' Ms Neeland told A Current Affair.

'We did think about taking Nestle on, but what chance do we have?'

'We felt really sad that a big multinational company like that could actually own something that we all love so much.'

In the wake of the bushfires and the coronavirus, Ms Neeland said small businesses have suffered as tourism has dwindled.

Fearing the initial time frame would put them at risk of losing more than $50,000 worth of labelling, the Neelands wrote to Nestle requesting a 12 month extension to make the transition but they never received a reply.

Even with an additional nine months, the couple expect to lose $5000 in labels.

Nestle have held the trademark for the term 'Freckle' since the 1950's, which are sold through their confectionery brand Allens

The seven-year-old business, which now employs 220 staff, has decided to rename its products 'polka dots'.

Swiss corporation Nestle is the world's largest food company with a presence in 187 countries world wide.

Last year alone, the company, which has more than 2000 brands, made a profit of 10.4 billion.

A Nestle spokeswoman said in a statement that the company was willing to work with Yarra Valley Chocolaterie and Ice Creamery to help minimise their cost and inconvenience.

'Freckles were originally created in 1955, with a registered trademark in place on the name Freckles to describe these hundreds-and-thousands-coated chocolates ever since,' the statement said.

'It’s important for companies to protect their trademarks by preventing unauthorised use, as if they don’t, they can lose the right to their brand names forever.'

'This is why when we became aware that Yarra Valley Chocolaterie was using our trademark, we asked them to stop using it.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8017879/Family-run-chocolate-company-hits-forced-rename-dozens-products-Nestle.html

558,Beijing punishes three Wall Street Journal reporters over 'the real sick man of Asia' headline,"['Tracy You', 'Tracy You For Mailonline']","China has ordered three reporters for The Wall Street Journal to leave the country after the U.S. newspaper declined to apologise for a headline that called China 'the real sick man of Asia' amid the coronavirus outbreak.

The opinion column, penned by an American professor and published earlier this month, has been deemed racist and slanderous by Beijing.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry said last Monday that it had lodged solemn representations with the publication over the article.

The expulsion came as Beijing also slammed Washington's decision to tighten rules on Chinese state media organisations in the US, calling the move 'unreasonable and unacceptable.'

China has revoked the press credentials of three Wall Street Journal reporters over a headline it deemed racist, spokesman of the country's Foreign Ministry Geng Shuang said today

In a statement today, the Ministry's spokesman Geng Shuang said the op-ed 'smears the efforts of the Chinese government and people on fighting (the virus) epidemic'.

'The Chinese people do not welcome media that publish racist statements and maliciously attacks China,' Geng told reporters.

'In light of this, China has decided to revoke the press cards of the three Wall Street Journal correspondents in Beijing starting today.'

He added: 'The editors used such a racially discriminatory and sensational title, triggering indignation and condemnation among the Chinese people and the international community.'

The ministry spokesman did not identify the journalists whose credentials were being revoked.

The Wall Street Journal said in its own report published on Wednesday that Deputy Bureau Chief Josh Chin and reporters Chao Deng and Philip Wen have been ordered to leave the country in five days. Chin and Deng are U.S. citizens and Wen is Australian.

The article in question is titled 'China is the Real Sick Man of Asia' and written by Professor Walter Russel Mead from Bard College, a private institution in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York.

The opinion column was penned by an American professor and published earlier this month

In a statement today, the Ministry's spokesman Geng Shuang said the op-ed 'smears the efforts of the Chinese government and people on fighting (the virus) epidemic'

The article criticised the Chinese government's initial response to the new coronavirus outbreak - calling the Wuhan city government at the virus epicentre 'secretive and self-serving', while dismissing national efforts as ineffective.

The novel coronavirus epidemic has killed over 2,000 people in China and infected more than 75,000, and has spread to at least two dozen countries around the world.

'The editors of the Wall Street Journal have nailed themselves to the pillar of shame,' wrote the nationalistic Global Times in an op-ed on Tuesday before the reporters were expelled.

The WSJ's remarks 'sound like gloating, and they disgust Chinese people,' it said.

Beijing's move come a day after the United States angered China for classifying five state media outlets, including Xinhua news agency and the China Global Television Network, as foreign missions, with State Department officials saying they were part of Beijing's growing 'propaganda' apparatus.

The novel coronavirus has killed at least 2,012 people and infected more than 75,000 globally

The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) column has also sparked an outrage among people of the Chinese origin living in and out of the country, with many of them branding the headline as 'offensive'.

Under Prof Mead's post on Twitter promoting the article, one reader 'Junya Qian' who claimed to be a former WSJ employee criticised the headline.

She wrote: 'I don't blame you since I know that editors normally choose the headlines in WSJ. But as a former employee of WSJ, I'm really disappointed that this kind of titles can appear on it. Although it's an editorial piece, this is more than inappropriate.'

A UK-based Twitter user 'Yiren Shen' said: 'Can't believe you actually used this title while so many people are fighting against the virus with the price of their lives.

'You may be feeling smart about coming up with this 'pun', but what I see from it is a sad soul devoid of compassion and humanity.'

WHY IS THE TERM 'SICK MAN OF ASIA' DEEMED OFFENSIVE BY CHINESE PEOPLE? The phrase 'sick man of Asia' originated in another term 'sick man of Europe', a label given to a European country facing impoverishment or economic difficulties. It was first used to describe the Ottoman Empire for its debt crisis in the 19th century. Its association with the Chinese can be tracked back to Shanghai-based English newspaper North China Daily News in 1896. A British writer used the phrase, 'sick man of East Asia', to illustrate the corrupt and bureaucratic Qing government which had been invaded by European powers and Japan. Liang Qichao, one of the most prominent Chinese scholars and reformists at the time, then used the term's Chinese translation 'dong ya bing fu' (东亚病夫) to show his concerns of the decline of physical prowess of the Chinese people. In Fist of Fury, Kung fu star Bruce Lee holds a plague bearing the Chinese characters 'sick man of East Asia' before defeating a dozen opponents and destroying the sign The phrase has since been closely associated with the stereotype that Chinese people were physically weak and disease-ridden. In one famous scene from Bruce Lee's film Fist of Fury, the Kung Fu star defeated more than a dozen opponents before destroying a plaque bearing the phrase.

A petition has been posted on the White House's website, demanding for 'a proper apology from WSJ to the Chinese community'.

The petition reads: 'Regardless of the author's view on China's problems, the title alone stokes racism against the Chinese people.

'That such a racially discriminatory title was allowed on WSJ indicates arrogance and poor judgment in WSJ's editing choices.'

The post has received more signatures than its goal of 100,000, which allows it to get a response from the White House.

Catherine Ceniza Choy, professor of ethnic studies at the University of California, Berkeley, regarded the article 'extremely harmful and wrong'.

She told NBC News: 'The consequences of publishing an opinion like this by mainstream media include stoking more fear and anxiety, and increasing hostility against Chinese and other Asians throughout the world.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8019869/Beijing-punishes-three-Wall-Street-Journal-reporters-real-sick-man-Asia-headline.html
559,Qantas takes extreme measures to protect its staff from coronavirus,"['Charlie Moore', 'Charlie Moore For Daily Mail Australia']","Qantas flight attendants taking Aussies home from a coronavirus-infected cruise ship in Japan will be placed in quarantine for two weeks when they land.

About 200 Australians will be evacuated from the Diamond Princess ship on a Qantas flight from Tokyo's Haneda Airport to Darwin Airport on Wednesday night.

Food will be left on their seats so they have absolutely no contact with around a dozen flight attendants who will stay on the plane's upper deck.

When the passengers land they will be kept in isolation for two weeks at a former workers' site near Darwin.

Qantas flight attendants taking Aussies home from a coronavirus-infected cruise ship (pictured) in Japan will be placed in quarantine for two weeks when they land

The extreme measures are similar to those taken by Qantas during a previous evacuation mission (pictured) taking Australians from Wuhan to Christmas Island earlier this month

The flight attendants will be kept in 'home quarantine' meaning they cannot return to work for two weeks.

The extreme measures are similar to those taken by Qantas during a previous evacuation mission taking Australians from Wuhan to Christmas Island earlier this month.

During that flight the airline provided passengers with a bright yellow plastic 'clinical waste' bags on their seats.

Inside the emergency kit was sanitiser, face masks and hand wipes.

Passengers had health checks before boarding the flight and had to wear surgical masks.

There was a limited food and beverage service to minimise interaction between crew and passengers and the plane had a three-day cleaning process.

The crew had masks, gloves and sanitisers and were placed on the upper deck of the aircraft.

The plane had medical-grade filters that remove particles in the air, including viruses

All of the 14 crew and four pilots had volunteered for the mission.

In the previous rescue mission, a seat kit left on passengers' seats included a bright yellow plastic bag (pictured) with 'clinical waste' written on it

Fifteen Australians will remain on the Diamond Princess Cruise.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters in Adelaide they had chosen to stay to be near family members who were being treated for the virus.

More than 30 Australians have contracted the disease on the ship, which has been quarantined in Yokohama for more than two weeks.

Mr Morrison said he understood the frustration of people who had been stuck on the ship.

'We want to get them home to their families as soon as possible,' he said.

Australia's chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said the older evacuees will have continuous access to medical assistance.

'I can be absolutely confident that they will be very well looked after here, in much better facilities than being in a tiny cabin on a cruise ship,' he told reporters in Darwin.

The cruise ship evacuees will be kept separate from hundreds of people already in isolation at the facility, who were evacuated from the Chinese epicentre of the virus.

Professor Murphy has sought to alleviate concerns in the Darwin community, saying they will be completely protected from the disease.

Wednesday's flight will also include New Zealanders, who will be transferred home after landing in Darwin.

Meanwhile, the 36 evacuees remaining on Christmas Island left on Wednesday, after most of the quarantined group returned to the mainland on Monday.

The facility will be readied for the possibility of more Australians facing the two-week isolation period.

Island administrator Natasha Griggs tweeted her thanks to those involved in the operation.

'Job well done! I couldn't be a more prouder Australian,' she wrote.

The flu-like illness has killed more than 2,000 people worldwide and infected at least 75,000 more - including 15 Australians - sparking fears the COVID-19 scare could turn into a pandemic.

American tech giant Apple has also announced iPhone production in China was likely to be 'constrained', sparking a global shortage of smart phones.

A fortnight after the first cases were revealed, the Reserve Bank of Australia discussed the possible effects on the economy at its first board meeting for 2020, held in early February.

'Members discussed the coronavirus outbreak, noting that it was a new source of uncertainty for the global economy,' the central bank minutes released on Tuesday said.

The Reserve Bank is expecting the coronavirus to hit the economy and be worse for Australia than previous disease outbreaks that originated in China. Pictured are passengers wearing protective face masks at Brisbane International Airport in January

Ninety-nine per cent of cases have been in China, where tens of millions of residents are in lockdown to contain the escalating crisis

'It was too early to determine the extent to which growth in China would be affected or the nature of the international spillovers.'

The central bank this month left interest rates on hold at a record-low of 0.75 per cent but forecast Australia's already weak economic growth pace would be even 'weaker in the near term' from the effects of the summer bushfires and the coronavirus.

The RBA is expecting coronavirus to be worse than the 2003 outbreak of SARS, also known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.

Unlike 17 years ago, China is now Australia's biggest trading partner and an even bigger buyer of Australian iron ore, coal and university education.

China makes up more than a third of Australia's annual exports, with trade to this country worth $118billion a year.

'China now accounted for a much larger share of the global economy and was more closely integrated, including with Australia, than in 2003 at the time of the SARS outbreak,' the RBA said.

'The economic effects would depend crucially on the persistence of the outbreak and measures taken to contain its spread.'

The coronavirus is already affecting global manufacturing output with Apple announcing it had cut back iPhone production in China. Pictured is a stock image of women using an iPhone

The coronavirus is already affecting global manufacturing output with Apple announcing it had cut back iPhone production in China.

'Worldwide iPhone supply will be temporarily constrained,' it said in an investor update this week.

'These iPhone supply shortages will temporarily affect revenues worldwide.'

Apple iPhones are mainly produced at Shenzhen, north of Kong Hong.

They are not made in central China's Hubei province, which contains the city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus outbreak originated in January.

Apple, nonetheless, expected iPhone production to slow as Chinese demand for its products fell.

Earlier this month, Qantas suspended direct flights from Sydney to Beijing and Shanghai until March 29.

China was Australia's fifth most popular overseas destination last year, with 608,000 trips made there in 2019, Australian Bureau of Statistics data released on Tuesday showed.

Australians spent an average of 17 days there during their visit.

This week, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced foreign nationals who had visited China would be banned from entering Australia for another week, from February 15.

In July 2003, just four months after SARS reached Hong Kong, Australia's Treasury department described the outbreak as something that would only 'have a mild and temporary impact on the Australian economy'.

562,"Princess Beatrice wishes she could 'do something private' for wedding, royal expert claims","['Harriet Johnston', 'Harriet Johnston For Mailonline']","Prince Andrew's scandal has left an 'ugliness' around Princess Beatrice's wedding and the bride-to-be wishes she could 'take off to Italy and do something private', a royal expert has claimed.

Royal commentator Victoria Arbiter revealed how there had been 'a lot of talk' about how Princess Beatrice, 31, would have loved to travel abroad for a 'low-key' wedding where there would be 'a lot less scrutiny'.

Beatrice, the eldest daughter of the Duke and Duchess of York, is set to marry Italian property developer Edo Mapelli Mozzi, 36, in May at the Chapel Royal in St James's Palace.

Speaking to Australian website 9Honey, Victoria said: 'I feel for [Princess Beatrice and Edo] a little bit because there is so much ugliness surrounding Prince Andrew at the moment and so by extension that does trickle down to his daughters.'

Royal commentator has revealed how Princess Beatrice, 31, dreamed of having a 'private' wedding with property developer Edo Mapelli Mozzi, 36, in Italy where she could avoid scrutiny (pictured together)

Last week, a source revealed how Princess Beatrice had altered wedding plans to be smaller than originally desired because of the furore surrounding Prince Andrew.

Despite her desire to avoid scrutiny and negative press, Victoria said Beatrice ultimately wanted to have the wedding in the UK, because of her closeness to the Queen and Prince Philip, who would be unlikely to travel abroad.

And while all three of the royal weddings within the last two years have taken place in the grand Windsor Castle, Victoria said a more 'low-key' event was actually more suited to Princess Beatrice's style.

She said: 'No bride wants to be compared to the bride that has gone before, so I think with Beatrice we're going to see something smaller...I think she's going to be keen to keep negative press at bay.'

She said the 'ugliness' surrounding Prince Andrew had 'trickled down' to overshadow Princess Beatrice's big day (pictured together in June 2019 at Ascot)

She added that while both Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, 29, are 'both lovely', Beatrice was actually more of an introvert than her 'gregarious' sister.

She said it is Eugenie who has 'all the famous friends', and is 'out and about a bit more' than elder Beatrice, who will want 'a more personal wedding'.

Beatrice and Edo had been together for 11 months at the time they announced their engagement in September last year.

Father-of-one Edo proposed with a ring estimated to have cost £100,000, while the pair were holidaying in Italy.

The royal commentator also revealed how Princess Eugenie is the 'more gregarious' sister and is more of 'an extrovert' than elder Princess Beatrice (pictured together in June 2018)

Prince Andrew stepped back from royal duty in November following a car crash interview with BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis (pictured, during the interview)

The scandal surrounding Prince Andrew's friendship with Epstein intensified in December after a second woman who was allegedly abused by billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein claimed she had sex with the duke.

This came after the prince denied sleeping with 17-year-old Virginia Roberts at the Belgravia home of Ghislaine Maxwell - who is accused of trafficking in young women for Epstein.

His royal resignation in November followed a car crash interview with BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis, after which he was lambasted by critics for failing to show regret or empathy for Epstein's victims.

On Wednesday's episode, the 31-year-old was left fuming after producers told her Amanda's decision - responding that she'd 'never' do the same to her.

But her bizarre reaction came as a shock to some viewers - who questioned 'what the hell' Tash was still doing in the experiment, after she previously said she 'wasn't attracted' to Amanda and felt they had 'no chemistry'.

'I would never have made her walk into this by herself!' Tash Herz (pictured) was stunned after a producer informed her that Amanda had requested they arrive to the dinner party separately

'Tash can’t even tell Amanda why she turned vegan, so why is she so petty that she wouldn’t go to the dinner party with her?' one wrote.

'It’s so hypocritical how Tash is saying “I don’t want to walk into the dinner party with her,” but then every time Amanda tries to hang out with her, Tash is like “nah, I can’t”,' a second chimed in.

'Tash just said there's no chemistry... what the f**k is she still doing here?' a third raged.

'You [were mad] because people will see that if Amanda turns up alone, you'll be confronted with the question: ""What the hell are you still doing there?""' a fourth chimed in.

Taken a turn! Fans lashed out at Tash after she became angered over her wife's decision to rock up the party alone - branding her a 'hypocrite'

Not happy: Discussing her decision to walk in alone earlier in the episode, Amanda had said: 'I figured there was no point trying to be fake about the situation'

As soon as Amanda entered the dinner party, she was confronted by outspoken brunette Hayley Vernon - who also appeared enraged at her decision to come alone.

And while many viewers had turned on Tash, others agreed with her and Hayley's anger - with one fan writing: 'Amanda is so aggressive all the time and Hayley giving it to her is giving me LIFE. Team Tash.'

'An aggressive woman coming at you? Now you know how Tash has felt since day one,' a second added.

Discussing her decision to walk in alone earlier in the episode, Amanda said: 'I figured there was no point trying to be fake about the situation.

Team Tash: While many viewers had turned on Tash, others agreed with her and Hayley's frustrations over Amanda's decision

The final supper: After weeks of bickering, Married At First Sight's lesbian brides Amanda and Tash reached breaking point at Wednesday's dinner party

'I don't feel the need to walk in as friends... Let's take off the mask and let's cut the bulls**t.'

Later in the night, the pair's relationship appeared to come to an almighty end - with even the show's relationship experts deeming the marriage over.

'Neither of them are taking any accountability in the breakdown of this relationship,' mused Mel Schilling.

'It's over for these two and I feel really sad about it,' John Aiken added.

She told the publication: 'In my opinion I started modelling way too young. I was still growing and my confidence wasn’t fully matured. I didn’t love myself, or didn’t necessarily think I was worthy of all of the recognition I was getting.

'When I was younger, I would see photos of myself that I hated and would be mortified that people wanted to work with me, because I was so self-conscious.'

Instead the model said that she had only been interested in fashion if it involved horses, such as when her supermodel mother Yolanda bought her new Hermes riding saddle for Christmas one year.

The pair pointed to similar delays at other shows in the suit, in which they have named both Madonna and promoters Live Nation.

Legal documents stated: 'By the time of the concerts' announcements, Madonna had demonstrated flippant difficulty in ensuring a timely or complete performance.

'And Live Nation was aware that any statement as to a start time for a show constituted, at best optimistic speculation.'

The advertised start time was 8.30pm but the September show allegedly didn't begin until three hours later, while in October, Madonna took to the stage at 10.40pm - more than two hours late.

The pair claim the delays left them stranded when the shows finished in the early hours of the morning because they missed scheduled trains or other rides home,

They also said the unannounced hold-up - which they maintain Madonna admitted was her fault - ruined their plans for the following day.

And due to a ban on phone usage at the concerts, the men say they were unable to arrange alternative ways of getting home.

The pair are seeking damages and lawyer fees and are suing for breach of contract, loss of value, false advertisement and negligent misrepresentation.

The US star ended her wild night at top London nightspot The Box, emerging at 4am, but the shenanigans started hours earlier as viewers watched the star downing tequila during the ceremony at the O2 on Tuesday night.

Lizzo, 31, looked sensational in a sheer dress over a racy corset for her afterparty look, emerging from The Box after a night of party hopping.

Wild night: She may have missed out on a prize at the 2020 BRIT Awards, but Lizzo still partied hard on Tuesday night, emerging from The Box at 4am

The Juice singer wowed in her racy ensemble, showing off her curves in the lingerie layered under a floral print sheer dress teamed with ankle boots.

She looked in great spirits as she emerged from The Box in the early hours, wrapping a pal's jacket around her shoulders as she headed to her car.

It was a wild night for the US star who took in the party hot-spots of London, hitting the Warner Records afterparty at Chiltern Firehouse earlier in the evening.

Lizzo partied with her new BFF Harry Styles. The pair previously demonstrated their love for one another by covering each other's hits during separate appearances on Radio 1's Live Lounge and also teamed up for a Miami performance of Juice last month.

Dressed to party: The Juice singer wowed in her racy ensemble, showing off her curves in the lingerie layered under a floral print sheer dress teamed with ankle boots

And on Tuesday they had the chance to party together, kicking off their night with some heavy drinking during the ceremony.

Host Jack Whitehall stopped by Harry's table during the ceremony, trying out the ex One Direction star's drink and grimacing as he realised it was neat tequila.

Handing the drink to Lizzo, who was seated on the next table, Jack and Harry were both gobsmacked when the singer downed the tequila, while she was later seen with a champagne glass in hand backstage.

Always time for her fans: The popular star had time to sign autographs for fans waiting outside the Chiltern Firehouse

Pals: Lizzo partied with her new BFF Harry Styles who was also spotted emerging from The Box in the early hours

Lizzo lost out on the International Female Solo Artist BRIT on Tuesday night to fellow US star Billie Eilish, 18, but did wow the crowd with her performance of her biggest hits during the ceremony.

Harry meanwhile missed out on Best Album and British Male Solo Artist.

Instead Lewis Capaldi, Stormzy and Billie Eilish led the winners in a largely male dominated BRIT Awards shortlist.

Lewis, 23, claimed two awards from four nominations, triumphing in the categories for New Artist and Song of the Year.

Getting the party started: On Tuesday night the pals had the chance to party together, kicking off their night with some heavy drinking during the ceremony

The latter nomination was awarded for hit single Someone You Loved, a track Capaldi insisted was written for his late grandmother - not former girlfriend and current Love Island star Paige Turley.

Meanwhile Stormzy, 26, picked up the award for Best Male Solo Artist in front of a star-studded audience that included ex-girlfriend Maya Jama.

Accepting his award, the grime star was quick to reference the gender disparity at this year's ceremony by thanking the team of 'brilliant women' who form his management team.

Down it! Host Jack Whitehall stopped by Harry's table during the ceremony, trying out the star's drink and grimacing as he realised it was neat tequila, only for Lizzo to down it

Rising superstar Billie Eilish, 18, received a nod in the International Female Solo Artist category alongside Lizzo and Ariana Grande.

And after performing new James Bond soundtrack No Time To Die live for the first time, she claimed her first BRIT Award from former Spice Girl Mel C.

Despite Billie's success, only four nominations out of a possible 25 in the categories which are not gender-specific featured women.

What a night: Lizzo was later seen with a champagne glass in hand backstage

What loss? Lizzo lost out on the International Female Solo Artist BRIT on Tuesday night to fellow US star Billie Eilish

There were no female performers included in the shortlists for best group or album awards, although English singer Mabel, 23, was nominated for three awards and ultimately claimed one of the biggest of the night - Best British Female Artist.

Elsewhere Dave's excellent Psychodrama beat stiff competition to win Best Album ahead of Stormzy's new release Heavy Is The Head, Michael Kiwanuka's self-titled LP Harry Styles' Fine Line and Lewis Capaldi's Divinely Uninspired To A Hellish Extent.

Oxford based band Foals won Best Group after a return to the spotlight with their conceptual, two-part Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost.

Wow factor: She pulled out all the stops as she took to the stage earlier in the evening for a medley of her biggest hits

Stage costume: The singer looked amazing in a woven tan leather bodysuit as she performed

The group beat Bastille, Bring Me The Horizon, Coldplay and D-Block Europe to the honour on Tuesday night.

Taking it global, innovative rapper Tyler, The Creator beat Bruce Springsteen, Burna Boy, Dermot Kennedy and Post Malone in the category for International Male Solo Artist.

The lack of nominations in for female artists comes despite a major overhaul of the Brits' voting academy in 2017 to make it more gender balanced and diverse, with hundreds of new members invited to join the pool.

The awards are voted for by around 1,500 people from across the UK music industry including journalists, record label employees and musicians.

The rising star winner was announced as Celeste late last year, while the producer of the year will be announced at a later date.

The international group and video categories were axed by organisers this year.

Party pals: Harry Styles was spotted chatting to his ex Kendall Jenner as they mingled at the Sony after-party following the BRIT Awards 2020 on Tuesday night

What a vision: Kendall was later pictured leaving the Box club where she continued to party with the heartthrob

Harry, who was first linked to the model in 2014, reportedly struck up a close friendship with Kendall when they met at The X Factor USA studio while One Direction recorded their performance.

They then enjoyed a Caribbean getaway together in 2016, before being spotted on a dinner date at Ysabel in Los Angeles last September.

At the time a source told People: 'Harry has always been 'that guy' for Kendall.

'She would love to be in a real relationship with him, but he's always had issues settling down in the past with her because he has that rock star mentality.'

Mingling: The pair looked closer than ever as they chatted and laughed with a group of friends, enjoying a long-awaited catch-up at The Standard

Lewis Capaldi, Stormzy and Billie Eilish led the winners on Tuesday evening in a largely male dominated BRIT Awards shortlist.

Lewis, 23, claimed two awards from four nominations, triumphing in the categories for New Artist and Song of the Year.

The latter nomination was awarded for hit single Someone You Loved, a track Capaldi insisted was written for his late grandmother - not former girlfriend and current Love Island star Paige Turley.

Meanwhile Stormzy, 26, picked up the award for Best Male Solo Artist in front of a star-studded audience that included ex-girlfriend Maya Jama.

Accepting his award, the grime star was quick to reference the gender disparity at this year's ceremony by thanking the team of 'brilliant women' who form his management team.

Rising superstar Billie Eilish, 18, received a nod in the International Female Solo Artist category alongside the likes of Lizzo and Ariana Grande.

And after performing new James Bond soundtrack No Time To Die live for the first time, she claimed her first BRIT Award from former Spice Girl Mel C.

Despite Billie's success, only four nominations out of a possible 25 in the categories which are not gender-specific featured women.

What a surprise! Kendall appeared to have made a special trip across the pond for the event

Lumberjack chic: Cool: Bella layered her look with a leather jacket and added some orange-lens shades and a black satchel bag to her quirky look

There were no female performers included in the shortlists for best group or album awards, although English singer Mabel, 23, was nominated for three awards and ultimately claimed one of the biggest of the night - Best British Female Artist.

Elsewhere Dave's excellent Psychodrama beat stiff competition to win Best Album ahead of Stormzy's new release Heavy Is The Head, Michael Kiwanuka's self-titled LP Harry Styles' Fine Line and Lewis Capaldi's Divinely Uninspired To A Hellish Extent.

Oxford based band Foals won Best Group after a return to the spotlight with their conceptual, two-part Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost.

The group beat Bastille, Bring Me The Horizon, Coldplay and D-Block Europe to the honour on Tuesday night.

Wow! Kendall's showstopping two-piece flaunted her svelte frame to perfection

Pose: Kendall's ensemble dazzled as she worked her magic for the cameras inside the event

Taking it global, innovative rapper Tyler, The Creator beat Bruce Springsteen, Burna Boy, Dermot Kennedy and Post Malone in the category for International Male Solo Artist.

The lack of nominations in for female artists comes despite a major overhaul of the Brits' voting academy in 2017 to make it more gender balanced and diverse, with hundreds of new members invited to join the pool.

The awards are voted for by around 1,500 people from across the UK music industry including journalists, record label employees and musicians.

The rising star winner was announced as Celeste late last year, while the producer of the year will be announced at a later date.

The international group and video categories were axed by organisers this year.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8019493/BRITs-2020-Harry-Styles-catches-ex-Kendall-Jenner-Sony-party.html

Bieber, 25, used Havening to relax when he felt a bit anxious amid a crowded scene on set as he filmed the video for his single Yummy on Wednesday's edition of Justin Bieber: Seasons, the docuseries about the pop superstar airing on YouTube Premium.

'Justin and I developed a routine, in when he feels stressed, that he can use a technique called Havening I was trained in,' Bieber's health coach Dr. Buzz Mingin said.

The medical professional continued, 'Havening is a psychosensory technique that actually raises the feel-good chemicals in your brain on demand.'

Mingin said the routine provides the Canadian recording artist with an option 'to know what it is he should be doing in the moment he's feeling stressed.'

The health coach said he and Bieber have 'a coordinated signal ... that lets me know what's wrong, how he feels, and what he needs.'

In detail: Hailey described Havening as, 'It's almost like when you're a kid and your mom is rubbing your back to sleep and it's the best feeling in the world? It's kind of like that, except you're doing it for yourself'

'It's basically like a self-soothing thing: Everybody kind of has their own version of Havening without knowing it,' the model, 23, said on the online show. 'It's like when you're a little kid and you suck your thumb to soothe yourself. When you're starting to feel really stressed out or just to keep yourself calm.

'It's almost like when you're a kid and your mom is rubbing your back to sleep and it's the best feeling in the world? It's kind of like that, except you're doing it for yourself.'

Rappers Boosie Badazz and Young Thug criticized Dwayne Wade via social media Wednesday for supporting his daughter Zaya, 12, amid her revelation she identifies as female.

Young Thug, 28, used misgendering terminology in his tweet (that he later deleted), writing, 'All I wanna say to dwade son is ""GOD DONT MAKE MISTAKES"" but hey live your true self.'

Boosie Badazz took to Instagram with his video message, which he captioned, 'IM GO SAY IT SINCE THIS P**** A** WORLD AINT GO SAY S****‼️U TRIPPIN N**** #period.'

The latest: Rappers Boosie Badazz, 37, and Young Thug, 28, criticized Dwayne Wade, 38, via social media Wednesday for supporting his daughter Zaya, 12, amid her revelation she identifies as female

In the clip, the 37-year-old rapper also misgendered Zaya, arguing that Zaya is too young to identify her gender.

'I gotta say something about this s***, bro - Dwyane Wade, you gone too f***ing far, dawg,' Boosie said. 'That is a male. A 12-year-old. At 12, they don't even know what they next meal gon' be.

'They don't have s*** figured out yet. He might meet a woman, anything, at 16 and fall in love with her. But his d*** be gone - how he gon' - like, bruh, you going too far, dawg.'

Boosie, a native of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, repeatedly pleaded for Wade to prohibit Zaya from undergoing any potential surgical procedures.

Speaking his mind: Boosie Badazz took to Instagram with a video message

Tweets live forever: Young Thug posted his take on the situation, later deleting it

'Don't cut his d*** off, bruh,' he said. 'Like, bruh, for real, if he gon' be gay, let him be gay. But don't cut his d*** off, bruh. Don't - and dress him as a woman, dawg. He's 12-years-old.

'He's not up there year. He hasn't made his final decisions yet. Don't cut his f***ing dick off, Dwyane Wade, bruh. You f***ing trippin', dawg.'

The comments came about a week after Wade, who retired from the NBA last year after a 15-season career opened on Ellen about a key exchange with Zaya, his child from his marriage to Siohvaughn Funches.

'Zion, born as a boy, came home and said, ""Hey, so I want to talk to you guys. I think going forward I am ready to live my truth,' said the 13-time All-Star. 'I want to be referenced as ""she"" and ""her."" I would love for you guys to call me Zaya.'

Wade added: 'When our child comes home with a question, when our child comes home with an issue, when our child comes home with anything, it's our job as parents to listen to that, to give them the best information that we can, the best feedback that we can - and that doesn't change because sexuality is now involved in it.'

Advice: Boosie also advised Wade not to dress Zaya in feminine clothes

Parenting: Union on Tuesday took to Twitter with a clip of Dwayne and Zaya chatting about life while riding in a golf cart

Wade, who played for the Miami Heat for the majority of his career, said that he and wife Gabrielle Union are 'proud parents of a child in the LGBTQ+ community and ... proud allies as well' who take their 'roles and responsibility as parents very seriously.'

Wade said he and Union were focused on 'trying to figure out as much information as we can to make sure that we give our child the best opportunity to be her best self.'

Union last week took to Twitter with a clip of Dwayne and Zaya chatting about life while riding in a golf cart.

She captioned the shot: 'Meet Zaya. She's compassionate, loving, whip smart and we are so proud of her. It's Ok to listen to, love & respect your children exactly as they are. Love and light good people.'

Opening up: Wade, who retired from the NBA last year after a 15-season career, appeared on Ellen last week, where he opened up about a key exchange with Zaya

In the clip, Zaya opened up about her insights about being one's true self while chatting with her father.

'What's the point of being on this earth if you're gonna try to be someone you're not?' she said. 'It's like you're not even living as yourself, which is like the dumbest concept to me. Be true, and don't really care what the ""stereotypical"" way of being you is.'

She added that she remains patient and perseverance amid the times of change.

'You gotta just push through, I mean it's worth it, I feel like it's very worth it, when you reach that point of like, yourself.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8019211/Dwyane-Wade-targeted-rappers-Boosie-Badazz-Young-Thug-supporting-transgender-kid-Zaya-12.html

592,Today slumps to its lowest ratings of the year... despite the reinstatement of Karl Stefanovic,"['Demeter Stamell', 'Demeter Stamell For Daily Mail Australia']","Today has delivered its lowest ratings of the year so far, less than two months after the return of beloved host Karl Stefanovic.

Despite a strong start at the beginning of the year, the Channel Nine breakfast show pulled in a metro audience of just 173,000 on Wednesday.

They fell almost 100,000 viewers behind their biggest competitor, Channel Seven's Sunrise, which pulled a metro audience of 272,000.

Dropping: Today has delivered its lowest ratings of the year so far, less than two months after the return of beloved host Karl Stefanovic. Pictured with co-host Allison Langdon

The metro ratings measure TV viewers across five capital cities: Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth.

In Sydney alone, Today's audience measured 52,000, still behind Sunrise with 69,000.

According to a report by News.com.au on Wednesday, the ratings mark the show's lowest viewership since Karl, 45, returned in early January, and is close to its lowest ever.

It also marked the second day in a row Today's viewership has been below 200,000, with the average lower than last year, when Deborah Knight and Georgie Gardner were at the helm.

In an interview with News.com.au, media analyst Steve Allen hinted that Karl would have to find a way to win back the audience's trust.

'The majority of the breakfast audience is female, and they were the ones that reacted greatly against Stefanovic's various missteps in 2018,' he said.

'Our knowledge of that audience is that they don't forgive easily. We were never convinced his return after a year and a bit of PR boosting would rebuild the bridge.'

Karl was famously axed from the program in December 2018, after 14 years of hosting the long-running TV show.

Asking for forgiveness: In an interview with News.com.au, media analyst Steve Allen hinted that Karl would have to find a way to win back the audience's trust. Pictured at a Logies brunch on the Gold Coast in July 2019

His departure was effective immediately, with Channel Nine's director of news, Darren Wick, saying it was 'time for him to step off', as reported by The Guardian.

The announcement came shortly after his wedding to Jasmine Yarbrough, 36, amid growing scrutiny surrounding his personal life.

'Thanks to our viewers mostly, you are what matters most. It's been a tough time. Thanks for hanging in there,' Karl said in a statement after the announcement of his departure.

In comparison: It also marked the second day in a row Today's viewership has been below 200,000, with the average lower than last year, when Deborah Knight (left) and Georgie Gardner (right) were at the helm

Shortly afterwards, it was announced Deb, 47, and Georgie, 49, would be assuming the roles of hosts of the breakfast TV show.

But their run was short-lived, with the series plummeting to some of its lowest ratings on record.

The program's metro ratings dropped below 200,000 in 2019, with the ABC's News Breakfast drawing in more viewers for the first time ever.

Taking the plunge: According to News.com.au on Wednesday, the ratings mark the show's lowest viewership since Karl, 45, returned in early January, and is close to its lowest ever

In November last year, the show suffered its worst ratings for the entire year, with just 155,000 viewers across five capital cities.

That same month, it was announced Deb and Georgie would be departing the program, with Karl returning once again alongside Allison Langdon, 40.

'Yes, I am as shocked about this as everyone else. It's not something that I thought would come up again,' Karl told The Sydney Morning Herald in November upon hearing the announcement of his return.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8019105/Today-slumps-lowest-ratings-year-despite-reinstatement-Karl-Stefanovic.html

'The behaviour displayed was misogynistic, crude and highly offensive.'

Mr Wellington went on to say that while he legally does not have the authority to remove a sitting councillor, Jess brought the council's name into 'disrepute' and 'undermined' its the good reputation.

In the photo, Steve delicately held Jenna's head in his hand while gently kissing her, as she smiled up at her husband-to-be while she held his hand.

Writing his own sweet caption, Steve gushed: 'When you wake in the morning I will kiss your face with a smile no one has ever seen. When you wake in the morning I will kiss your eyes and say it’s you I have loved all these years.'

All eyes were on Jenna's incredible engagement ring which had a stunning stone set across a shiny gold band.

Happiness: Jenna and Steve went public with their relationship in November 2018, just days after she officially filed for divorce from ex Channing Tatum

'I love you both, and all I can say is your love is pure magic.

On Valentine's Day, Jenna said in a heartfelt post: 'You flew into my life like a rocket, lit it up beyond what i could've expected or imagined, and every day i am in awe over the love, care and nurture you show me, Evie and everyone around you.

'He was in a show called 'Once' on Broadway, seven years ago, and I went to see the show, and I was blown away by him and his talent, crying my eyes out,' she told Us Weekly in October.

'I took my mom, and we got to meet him. ""Oh, my God, you were amazing!""'

The actress called it quits on her nearly nine-year marriage with Channing in April 2018 and the couple recently finalised a custody schedule for their six-year-old daughter Everly.

Channing and Jenna — who met while filming their hit dancing movie Step Up in 2006 — will alternate weekends, while Jenna will get Everly Monday through Wednesday, and Channing will be on Dad duty Wednesday through Friday.

Channing has since moved on to find love in the arms of British musician Jessie J, who he was with for a year before a brief split, but the pair confirmed earlier this month that they are firmly back on.

600,Former Bachelorette Georgia Love denies she has false lashes as she shows off her incredible eyes,"['Demeter Stamell', 'Demeter Stamell For Daily Mail Australia']","Georgia Love has addressed persistent rumours she has false eyelashes, insisting they're all natural.

In a post on Instagram on Tuesday, the 31-year-old former Bachelorette maintained mascara was the secret to her dramatic eyes.

'I'm ALWAYS asked where I get my lashes done so I'm setting the record straight - I don't! I'm just obsessed with mascara!' she wrote.

They're real: Georgia Love has addressed persistent rumours she has false eyelashes, insisting they're all natural

It's not the first time Georgia has denied having false eyelashes, telling beautyheaven in November 2018 she has 'naturally long lashes'.

'I always accentuate them. A good mascara will always make me feel like I've had my face done... I would rarely leave the house without it,' she added.

And she admitted she has an interesting - albeit dangerous - way of achieving her lash look.

Secret weapon: In a post on Instagram on Tuesday, the 31-year-old former Bachelorette maintained mascara was the secret to her dramatic eyes

'I've got quite long lashes, so I put a lot of mascara on instead of ever wearing false lashes or anything, but to make sure they look nice and natural and separated, I get a safety pin or needle and separate my lashes,' she revealed.

'People are always so freaked out when I do that, they think I'm going to poke myself in the eye but I've always done it. Maybe after a couple of coffees I wouldn't do it.'

It's a trick legendary starlet Audrey Hepburn would also use to help achieve her iconic eye look, with Georgia previously admitting she's a fan of the actress.

'I'm ALWAYS asked where I get my lashes done so I'm setting the record straight - I don't! I'm just obsessed with mascara!' she wrote

And in a July 2017 interview with Who magazine, as reported by Beauty Crew, Georgia once again maintained her eyelashes were all hers.

She said people just automatically assumed they were fake because of the length.

'I focus on my eyes. I'm very lucky I have such long eyelashes... It's funny, years ago I used to get comments and now everyone just assumes they're false!' she said.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8018971/Former-Bachelorette-Georgia-Love-denies-false-lashes-shows-incredible-eyes.html
601,Married At First Sight: Luke breaks his silence on Poppy's wild claims,"['Jo Scrimshire', 'Demeter Stamell For Daily Mail Australia']","Married At First Sight star Luke Eglin has responded to Poppy Jennings' extraordinary claims about their break-up, saying he wishes his ex-'wife' well and won't be taking part in a public slanging match.

Poppy had accused Luke in a lengthy Facebook post on Tuesday of making her feel 'uncomfortable' during filming, adding that he was 'petrified' of her telling the full story of her decision to leave the experiment.

Luke, a 39-year-old FIFO worker and father-of-two, told The Daily Telegraph on Wednesday: 'I am not going to make any comments because, honestly, the best way to react is not to react.'

Speaking out: MAFS star Luke Eglin has responded to Poppy Jennings' extraordinary claims about their break-up, saying he wishes her well and won't take part in a public slanging match

He added: 'To be honest, Poppy is a good person and the best of luck to her. I am not going to comment on anything because it is not worth it, it really isn't.

'Honestly, she just needs to move on like I have and that is it. We are finished on the show and that is as far as it goes.'

Luke, who works offshore as a maintenance supervisor, also told the Geelong Advertiser: 'The best response is not to respond. There's nothing I want to comment on because there's no point [in] making extra accusations.'

Wild claims: Poppy had accused Luke in a lengthy Facebook post on Tuesday of making her feel 'uncomfortable' during filming, adding that he was 'petrified' of her telling the full story

Poppy's Facebook post, which had attracted more than 10,000 comments before it was deleted on Tuesday afternoon, included wild accusations about her ex-'husband'.

'I was uncomfortable with all the things about this person I was matched with that didn't add up!' she wrote.

Poppy also claimed that Luke's bosses had spoken to him before his appearance on the show, warning him to be 'on his best behaviour'.

Moving on: Luke, a 39-year-old FIFO worker and father-of-two, told The Daily Telegraph, 'I am not going to make any comments because, honestly, the best way to react is not to react'

'You have seen minutes of footage here and there of a guy on his best behaviour because he was drilled by his bosses beforehand about how he had to behave!' she added.

According to Poppy, there were incidents that happened during filming that were 'too controversial' to be shown on television.

'I couldn't say what was happening behind the scenes, as it was too controversial, so let's just play her ugly crying and whinging over her kids,' she wrote.

'F**k, I'd probably hate me too! From what I heard that's all they play of me!'

During her time on MAFS, Poppy had often complained about missing her two-year-old twin sons, who were staying in Wollongong with her mother.

The last word? Poppy's Facebook post, which had attracted more than 10,000 comments before it was deleted on Tuesday afternoon, included wild accusations about her ex-'husband'

She also claimed that Luke wasn't genuinely upset when she left the experiment, and was more concerned about what she would say about him.

'Why is Luke crying when I left? What really happened that he was crying over! You don't know because I wasn't allowed to say! It's too controversial!' she continued.

'He's scared s**tless I will tell the truth. I was afraid to speak up! But f**k this s**t, I'm going to tell everything!

'It's not what you see, it's what you don't see! Go and ask Luke why I was so uncomfortable? Why the f**k did I really leave?

'He's petrified I'm going to talk. He knows he's f**ked up. Those tears from him are for his reputation and job!'

Claims: According to Poppy, there were incidents that happened during filming that were 'too controversial' to be shown on television. She added, 'He's scared s**tless I will tell the truth'

She concluded her post by saying that Luke needed to be held 'accountable'.

A spokesperson for Channel Nine and producers Endemol Shine Australia said: 'We have seen Poppy's post and note her distress - we have reached out to her to offer support and won't be making any further public comment, and will focus on doing our best to support both Poppy and Luke.'

Poppy's dramatic exit from MAFS aired at the end of Monday night's episode.

The mother-of-two couldn't even face her 'husband' and forced producers to break the news to him, after he had moved out of their apartment to give her space.

Luke was blindsided by Poppy's decision, fighting back tears as he tried to compose himself.

'I had hoped for me and Poppy, and I wanted a happy ending more than anything else. It's s**t, but what else can you do? It's all over now,' he said.

'What else can you do?' A Married At First Sight producer delivered the sad news to Luke, who looked devastated by Poppy's decision to break up with him

Explaining her decision, Poppy said: 'I didn't want to leave on bad terms or just give up easily, but at the same time being away from my kids has been the hardest thing.

'I didn't realise it was going to affect me so much. All I've done is cry. I really, really thought that this was going to be the happy ending.

'[I thought] I'd meet someone who would be a good dad to my kids and I'd have a happy family, because I deserve that.'

Mike, who appeared on the show last year alongside Elizabeth, also hit out at his former co-star while sharing his views on the new season.

'I suspect that she is going to behave the same as she did last season, which was completely unreasonable. I'm just saying that, and it's not a personal issue. This is a totally logical and reasonable objective opinion,' he told fans.

'I don't know why the hell they put her on here again? Like I said, we'll give her another chance and see how things unfold.'

Mike isn't the only cast member from last year to slam Elizabeth's return either.

In December, Jessika Power said: 'I always thought they would put Mel [Lucarelli] back on. They're making a show, so maybe they thought Lizzie would be a bit more controversial. For her to go and do it again, she must be really desperate for love.'

620,"Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark, 51, is hospitalised following a skiing accident in Switzerland","['Alice Murphy', 'Brittany Chain For Daily Mail Australia']","Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark has been hospitalised following a skiing accident in Switzerland last week.

Frederik, 51, sustained a 'minor injury' to his left shoulder on the slopes at Verbier in southwestern Switzerland, an exclusive resort where he regularly holidays with wife Crown Princess Mary, 48, and their four children.

A royal winter playground, Verbier attracts a glittering guest list each season including Prince William, the Duchess of Cambridge and their three children George, Charlotte and Louis, and Sarah Ferguson and her daughters Princess Beatrice and Eugenie.

Prince Frederik was admitted to Rigshospitalet - a top-tier specialist hospital in Copenhagen - upon his return to Denmark, where doctors performed a routine operation on Tuesday.

The procedure was successful and will not interrupt Frederik's schedule of official engagements, an official statement from the Danish Royal House said.

Crown Prince Frederik (left in 2014) sustained a 'minor injury' to his left shoulder on the slopes at Verbier in southwestern Switzerland, an exclusive resort where he regularly holidays with wife Crown Princess Mary (right in 2014) and their four children

'His Royal Highness The Crown Prince suffered a minor injury in (sic) the left shoulder last week in connection with skiing in Switzerland,' Danish Royal Communications Director Lene Balleby said on Tuesday.

'The Crown Prince has therefore today been examined and treated at the Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen.'

Frederik is assumed to have been skiing at the luxury wooden chalet he bought with Australian-born Princess Mary more than a decade ago.

The couple have been staying in the lodge to be close to their children who are spending three months in a Swiss boarding school to further their international education.

Prince Christian, 14, Princess Isabella, 12 and nine-year-old twins Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine temporarily transferred from Tranegård school in eastern Denmark to the Lemania-Verbier International School in the Swiss Alps in January.

Frederik and Mary have been staying in the lodge to be close to their four children (left to right: Prince Christian, Princess Isabella, Prince Josephine and Prince Vincent) who are spending three months in a Swiss boarding school to further their international education (the family attend a photo call during their annual Ski holiday in 2015)

Skiing accidents that shocked the world MICHAEL SCHUMACHER Formula One kingpin Michael Schumacher was skiing with his 14-year-old son Mick at Meribel in the French Alps on December 29, 2013 when he lost his footing, fell and hit his head on a rock. The racing star sustained a serious head injury despite wearing a ski helmet. He was airlifted to Grenoble Hospital where doctors performed two emergency surgeries and placed Schumacher in an induced coma because of his traumatic brain injuries. Despite reports of improvement, in November 2014 it was revealed that Schumacher was paralysed and in a wheelchair, and had lost the ability to speak along with much of his memory. In September 2019, French outlet Le Parisien reported Schumacher had been admitted to the Hopital Europeen Georges-Pompidou in Paris for pioneering cell treatment. NATASHA RICHARDSON British actress Natasha Richardson slipped and hit her head during a beginner's ski lesson at the Mont Tremblant Resort in Quebec, Canada on March 16, 2009. She refused medical treatment and initially appeared fine, but three hours later she developed a headache at her hotel. Richardson was taken to hospital where she died two days after the accident on March 18 at the age of 49. The star had not been wearing a helmet during her lesson. Her death sparked debate around the world about whether wearing helmets should be mandatory on the slopes. SONNY BONO American singer-songwriter and one half of iconic duo Sonny and Cher Salvatore Phillip 'Sonny' Bono died after hitting a tree while skiing at Heavenly Mountain Resort near South Lake Tahoe in California. ANGELA MERKEL The German chancellor fractured her pelvis while cross-country skiing in the Swiss Alps in January 2014. Merkel also suffered severe bruising and was forced to cancel several meetings and trips over the following three weeks. PRINCESS CAROLINE OF MONACO An accomplished skier, the daughter of Hollywood queen turned real life royalty Grace Kelly badly injured her knee when she collided with another skier in Arlberg, Austria in February 2001. Her husband, Prince Ernst August of Hanover, launched a $36,000 rescue mission to airlift her off the mountain. ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER The then-Governor of California tripped over one of his ski poles and broke his right femur while skiing in Sun Valley, Idaho with his family on December 23, 2006. HEATHER MILLS The model and ex-wife of Sir Paul McCartney crashed into a plastic pole which had frozen solid while skiing on Moelltaler Glacier in the Austrian Alps in January 2011. She shattered a shoulder blade but took the accident in her stride, telling media outlets at the time: 'That's skiing, you know.' CROWN PRINCESS VICTORIA OF SWEDEN The heir to the Swedish throne slipped and sprained her ankle while skiing in the Italian Alipine resort of Cervinia in December 2013.

The Prince has been photographed on the slopes several times since the move, including on Mary's 48th birthday on February 5.

Frederik and Mary have faced criticism in recent weeks after it was revealed their ski chalet was being rented on Airbnb for $14,000 AUD a week when they were not using it.

The Danish royal family live on a public allowance paid by the taxpayer of around $4 million a year. The money is permitted to be spent on foreign assets only with the approval of lawmakers.

The couple have since announced they will no longer advertise the home as a rental due to privacy concerns.

The royal couple have come under fire after revealing they have made money from a private Swiss ski lodge they have secretly owned for 10 years

Member of Parliament Mai Villadsen told Danish media: 'I was very surprised when I found out that the family does not just have such a house, they have had such a house for 10 years, without any ordinary Danes knowing about it.

'We are the ones who pay the money so we must know about the house.'

The Royal House initially refused to comment on the matter, claiming it considers the purchase of the property a 'private matter' - to which Ms Villadsen retorted: 'I find it very difficult to see that a royal estate can be a private matter. To my knowledge, the appanage [considerable inheritance of heirs to the throne] has just increased.'

According to Danish magazine Billed-Bladet, the Crown Prince and Princess' property is a 'traditional Swiss wooden chalet with a nice, large terrace, located in a child-friendly neighbourhood and within walking distance of the children's school'.

The Crown Prince couple's secluded chalet features a fireplace, timber walls, ceilings and floorboards, as well as large windows looking onto the ski resort

Pictures advertising the property surfaced after a palace spokeswoman confirmed it would no longer be available to rent

While their secret residence drew criticism from one party within the Danish political sphere, Conservative member of parliament Birgitte Bergman said she can't see 'anything wrong' with the couple owning the Swiss home.

'My party support the royal family 100 per cent and the dispositions they now make, as long as it is within the law,' she said.

'We cannot see anything wrong with that at all. This is also to be regarded as an old case. This happened 10 years ago and has no relevance today.'

'I'm not there for you then. I'm off the clock, being a person. Like it or not, no one is a performing seal for you.'

624,Critics give mixed reviews to Justin Bieber's album Changes which celebrates love for wife Hailey,"['Rachel Mcgrath', 'Rachel Mcgrath For Dailymail.Com']","He dropped his fifth studio album Changes on Valentine's Day.

And critics have had a variety of reactions to Justin Bieber's first album release since 2015's Purpose.

What they can agree on is that the new music reflects the 25-year-old Canadian pop star's joy at being married to Hailey Baldwin and the bliss of life as a newlywed.

As for being any good, well it depends on who you ask.

New music: He dropped his fifth studio album Changes on Valentine's Day. And critics have had a variety of reactions to Justin Bieber's first album release since 2015's Purpose

'A passion project': What critics can agree on is that the new music reflects the 25-year-old Canadian pop star's joy at being married to Hailey Baldwin and the bliss of life as a newlywed

Changes offers fans 17 tracks in 51 minutes of listening and includes his single Yummy as well as songs with titles such as That's What Love Is, Come Around Me, All Around Me and Take It Out On Me.

'None of these songs are bad, exactly, but they’re almost universally forgettable, with little of the catchiness that’s been Bieber’s hallmark in the past,' opined music bible Rolling Stone.

The magazine added: 'It’s nice to know his life is so loving and boring now. The idea of expressing that feeling through music is nice, too, though a shorter, stronger project would have done so more effectively than this long, exhausting trudge.'

Billboard, meanwhile, is more favorable, observing: 'Gone is the dance floor fodder, replaced with futuristic R&B built upon a variety of trap beats. Meanwhile, the choruses are still designed with top 40 radio in mind.'

The outlet gushed that Changes is 'a literal passion project from one of pop’s most fascinating superstars.'

Mixed reviews: As the Los Angeles Times puts it, Changes 'depicts his relationship with Baldwin as a refuge from the unkind world he’s still not quite ready to reenter'

The New York Times describes the album as 'sinuous, meditative and largely impressive' and calls it 'a muted version' of R&B.

Bieber famously canceled the final leg of his 2017 Purpose world tour and laid low for a while as he struggled with the pressures of fame and his mental health.

During that time, he struck up a romance with model Hailey Baldwin and the couple married legally in September 2018, tying the knot for a second time a year later in a lavish ceremony in front of family and friends.

It's his marriage and his new wife that seem to have enabled the former tweener to return to the spotlight, or at least try to.

As the Los Angeles Times puts it, Changes 'depicts his relationship with Baldwin as a refuge from the unkind world he’s still not quite ready to reenter.'

'Long on clean-toned guitars and drowsy soul grooves — and many, many words about the love of a good woman — it represents a distinct shift from the throbbing EDM of Bieber’s last album, 2015’s Purpose,' the LA Times continues.

All about love: 'For a Valentine’s Day album about love in bloom, it sounds surprisingly serious and dark, with a one-track-mind.... What's missing is joy,' Variety opined

As for Hollywood bible Variety, The Biebs has 'never sounded better.

But when it comes to substance, Variety says the songs 'skim the surface.'

'His voice and the production are flawless, and his soul is in the right place — but there’s something airless about the album, too, like he could have left the window open a crack to let some sunshine in,' Variety states. 'For a Valentine’s Day album about love in bloom, it sounds surprisingly serious and dark, with a one-track-mind.... What's missing is joy.'

The Guardian says in its review of Changes that the album 'just feels subdued and unassuming, which are curious things for mainstream pop to be.'

'It’s a tentative, rather than all-guns-blazing, return, with a by-any-means-necessary bubblegum single dutifully tacked on to throw his record label a bone.'

Britain's NME writes that Changes 'is filled with mostly sub-three-minute tracks that open pleasantly but fail to keep the momentum. The results are tunes that finish abruptly, flag, or feel like interludes. '

'Throughout the record relies on the same production of pounding bass and icy synths; this gets tiresome quickly,' the outlet says. 'Lyrically, it’s filled with pseudo-intelligent babble.'

'Overly reliant on trendy production and profound(ish) romantic proclamations, it’s a disappointing comeback from an artist who has a track record in creating hits. It may be an album filled with sex jams and lovelorn lyrics, but sadly this is one romp that never reaches climax.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8018517/Critics-mixed-reviews-Justin-Biebers-album-Changes-celebrates-love-wife-Hailey.html

'There's so many people every day who are in a conversation with their girl or their wife or their mom and they break down, you know?

'But they don't have cameras capturing it. So people are like, ""Is he OK, is he having a mental breakdown?"" And I'm just emotional ... and that's OK.'

A closer look: The current owner bought the vacant land in 2014 for $9million said the gossip site

Referring to another occasion in 2018 when he looked emotional during a day out with his wife Hailey, he said: 'I remember just struggling.

'I remember feeling, like, emotionally, just overwhelmed and talking to her, not knowing how to communicate certain things and just feeling kind of, like, frustrated.

But Kristin Scott Thomas revealed a director once told her to be more 'appealing', a comment that left her blood boiling, as she discussed her prolific career with Town & Country on Wednesday.

The actress, 59, detailed the situation, without naming the filmmaker in question, to the publication, and admitted: 'I was so cross!

Angry: Kristin Scott Thomas detailed her fury at a director who told her to try and be more 'appealing' as she admitted it made her feel 'so cross', in an interview on Wednesday

'That really rubbed me up the wrong way. It kicked something off in me. Why the hell should I be appealing?

'Why should I be pretty, and sweet, and kind, and nice, and have everybody love me? Why? I'm incredibly grumpy about lots and lots of things.'

While she expressed her dismay over the interaction, Kristin gushed about working alongside Phoebe Waller-Bridge on the Golden Globe-winning show Fleabag.

Frustrating: Without naming the filmmaker in question, Kristin said: 'That really rubbed me up the wrong way. It kicked something off in me. Why the hell should I be appealing?'

In the incredibly moving monologue, her character Belinda talks in detail about how women are 'born with pain built in', compared to men who seek out pain elsewhere.

Of the scene, Kristin said: 'I knew this was something that a lot of women were just longing to get out there, because I was too.

'What's so clever about Phoebe is she articulates these really buried feelings – she expresses what we've all been thinking about for ages.'

Kristin, who is next set to grace our screens on Military Wives, added that she is keen for viewers to become attached to her characters.

She explained: I want people to like my characters because they can identify with them in some way, because of the naughty bit, the bad bit that is recognisable in each of us. I think it's sort of fun.'

Speaking to News.com.au on Wednesday, the 34-year-old personal trainer defended herself after criticising Tash, 31, in a series of since-deleted Instagram posts on Tuesday night.

'She's an idiot!' Married At First Sight's Amanda Micallef (pictured) has accused her ex-'wife', Tash Herz, of staging paparazzi photos with her new girlfriend, Madison Hewitt

Amanda went on to accuse Tash of having 'no regard or respect' for her while they were filming Married At First Sight last year.

'She's going around calling me aggressive. Well I showed her a little bit of aggression [on Instagram] last night to remind her that she's an idiot and I've got no respect to her,' she added.

Amanda's frustration appears to stem from the fact that Tash is flaunting her new romance before their split has aired on MAFS, spoiling their storyline for fans.

Connie was offered $100,000 by The Kyle and Jackie O Show to reveal what had triggered Poppy's decision to abruptly leave the experiment on Monday's episode.

But she refused to share any details beyond saying that it was a 'touchy' subject.

Tempting offer: Married At First Sight's Connie Crayden (pictured) was offered $100,000 by The Kyle and Jackie O Show to reveal why Poppy Jennings had walked out on Luke Eglin

Radio host Jackie 'O' Henderson asked: 'Obviously you would know [what happened] being on the cast of Married At First Sight. You're not going to tell me, but how controversial are we talking?'

Connie, who is paired with Jonethen Musulin on MAFS, replied: 'Alright, yeah... it's a touchy one, this one. I don't, I just don't feel comfortable, really, giving too much of my opinion on this matter because... I guess, you know, it is big and it's something that Poppy and Luke need to deal with themselves.'

Kyle Sandilands then joked that Poppy, 38, had caught Luke performing autofellatio, which prompted Connie to laugh awkwardly.

Her lips are sealed: But Connie, who is paired with Jonethen Musulin on MAFS, refused to share any details beyond saying that Poppy's departure was a 'touchy' subject

Jackie then pressed the issue again by asking: 'Is it something that's, like, an inappropriate incident?'

Connie replied: 'Yeah, inappropriate is one word to use, definitely. It's just, yeah... just, it's heavy, and...'

Kyle then offered Connie '$50,000 in cash' to reveal what had happened between Luke and Poppy, before raising his offer to $100,000.

'This must be the biggest secret ever in television,' he added.

Poppy had accused Luke in a lengthy Facebook post on Tuesday of making her feel 'uncomfortable' during filming, adding that he was 'petrified' of her telling the full story of her decision to leave the experiment.

'I was uncomfortable with all the things about this person I was matched with that didn't add up!' she wrote.

According to Poppy, there were incidents that happened during filming that were 'too controversial' to be shown on television.

'I couldn't say what was happening behind the scenes, as it was too controversial, so let's just play her ugly crying and whinging over her kids,' she wrote.

'F**k, I'd probably hate me too! From what I heard that's all they play of me!'

During her time on MAFS, Poppy had often complained about missing her two-year-old twin sons, who were staying in Wollongong with her mother.

The last word? Poppy's Facebook post, which had attracted more than 10,000 comments before it was deleted on Tuesday afternoon, included wild accusations about her ex-'husband'

She also claimed that Luke wasn't genuinely upset when she left the experiment, and was more concerned about what she would say about him.

'Why is Luke crying when I left? What really happened that he was crying over! You don't know because I wasn't allowed to say! It's too controversial!' she continued.

'He's scared s**tless I will tell the truth. I was afraid to speak up! But f**k this s**t, I'm going to tell everything!

'It's not what you see, it's what you don't see! Go and ask Luke why I was so uncomfortable? Why the f**k did I really leave?

'He's petrified I'm going to talk. He knows he's f**ked up. Those tears from him are for his reputation and job!'

She concluded her post by saying that Luke needed to be held 'accountable'.

Claims: According to Poppy, there were incidents that happened during filming that were 'too controversial' to be shown on television. She added, 'He's scared s**tless I will tell the truth'

A spokesperson for Channel Nine and producers Endemol Shine Australia said: 'We have seen Poppy's post and note her distress - we have reached out to her to offer support and won't be making any further public comment, and will focus on doing our best to support both Poppy and Luke.'

Luke responded to Poppy's extraordinary claims on Wednesday, telling The Daily Telegraph he wishes his ex-'wife' well and won't take part in a public slanging match.

The 39-year-old FIFO worker and father-of-two said: 'I am not going to make any comments because, honestly, the best way to react is not to react.

'To be honest, Poppy is a good person and the best of luck to her. I am not going to comment on anything because it is not worth it, it really isn't.

'Honestly, she just needs to move on like I have and that is it. We are finished on the show and that is as far as it goes.'

The mother-of-two couldn't even face her 'husband' and forced producers to break the news to him, after he had moved out of their apartment to give her space.

Luke was blindsided by Poppy's decision, fighting back tears as he tried to compose himself.

Clayburgh went on to act in more than 50 movies herself. She died from leukemia in 2010.

Tuesday Weld, 1972

They continued to date on and off until the early 1990s, when they filmed The Godfather III.

'I was really very taken with Al from the very beginning. Our relationship was absolutely wonderful in some ways, but is he the love of my life?

'No, not really, because he wasn’t the love “of my life”…

'He was the love of that time of my life. Each man had a different decade,' she said in an interview with The Telegraph in 2013 adding: 'Woody was my twenties, Warren was my thirties and Al was borderline: late thirties/early forties.

‘I never see Al now.’

And he also said that she will 'require nearly a year of therapy to recover.'

The dogs will not be taken away as they the site said they are 'huge pit bull advocates.'

This comes five years after her breasts are destroyed by a flesh-eating virus.

In a 2015 report, she said she lost both of her breasts to a flesh-eating disease, after a procedure to reduce the size of her implants went terribly wrong.

Rough turn of events: Her fiance, Mark Nason, spoke to the site, adding that 'doctors inserted pins and stitched up her arm but she remains hospitalized'

She went under the knife again in the hopes of reinvigorating her career and snagging 'boobilicous roles'.

On the E! reality series Botched, Heather asked Los Angeles-based surgeons Paul Nassif and Terry Dubrow to reconstruct her shriveled breasts, which she referred to as 'zombie boobs'.

'My whole career has been based around my breasts and when that was taken away from me my career was taken away from me,' she explained to the cameras.

She was in the mansion: The star seen here with the late Hugh Hefner during a Playboy event

She had the Baywatch look: The cover girl was seen at the premiere of Driven in 2001

Heather, who was grew up in San Francisco, moved to Los Angeles to become an actress, where started to feel the industry pressure to change her body. She decided to get breast implants and go from an A cup to a DD cup to give herself a leg up on her competition.

Her large breasts helped her land bit roles playing beautiful women on popular television shows, including Married... With Children.

'My number one competitor was Pamela Anderson,' Heather said of the former Baywatch star for roles, who is also known for her ample bosoms.

She made her way into films: The siren is seen here in the poster for Bikini Summer 3

Despite her success, Heather began to second guess her decision when she realized she wanted to audition for more serious roles like 'secretary to the president'.

'When you are in this entertainment business, you never think you are good enough. That really messed with my head,' she noted.

Heather decided she wanted a smaller chest, but after her reduction, her breasts were lopsided and there was rippling on her skin.

Her surgeon has promised her that his new procedure, in which he put screws in her rib cage, would give her the breasts she wanted.

After the surgery, her breasts looked great, but she felt deathly ill and her temperature began to spike. Her doctor immediately sent her to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a flesh-eating disease caused by Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

Heather came very close to dying and had to have her implants taken out. It took her a full year and half to recover, however, there was nothing left to her breasts except shriveled skin.

'Now that my breasts are out, I am not who I used to be at all,' she said. 'I feel like I lost my whole career.'

Scar incedent: In a 2015 report, she said she lost both of her breasts to a flesh-eating disease, after a procedure to reduce the size of her implants went terribly wrong

With the support of her friend Felix, Heather met with Dr Dubrow and Dr Nassif for a consultation, sharing her traumatic story.

'That's when plastic surgery can kill,' Dr Dubrow said of her infection.

Dr Dubrow noticed that she was wearing breast prosthesis that appeared to be a size D, causing him to initially worry that Heather would want a voluptuous chest that was not possible.

However, Heather candidly explained: 'I am just locked into having breasts.'

642,RHOC's Simon Barney reveals he is fighting stage 3 throat cancer and says it brought family together,"['Kellie Chudzinski', 'Kellie Chudzinski For Dailymail.Com']","Tamra Judge's ex husband Simon Barney is battling stage three throat cancer.

The 55-year-old appeared in the early seasons of Real Housewives of Orange County before his marriage to Judge collapsed and the ugly split tore their family apart.

He began an aggressive dual treatment of radiation and chemotherapy to target the cancer in January, receiving chemo every three weeks, with radiation five days a week for seven weeks, according to People magazine.

Fighting: Simon Barney, former Real Housewives of Orange County castmember revealed he is fighting stage 3 throat cancer and began intense treatment plan in January

The outlet reported that the former reality TV star first experienced symptoms in May, noticed salivary glands on one side were swollen.

Doctors initially thought the cause was infection but an ultrasound and biopsy led to his cancer diagnosis.

By the time of diagnosis the cancer had spread to his throat, tonsils and lymph nodes, leaving the disease too spread for surgery.

Along with his fiance of nine years, Catushia Ienna, he first shared the news with his ex-wife Judge and their children.

Judge and Barney share daughters Sidney, 21, and Sophia, 14, as well as son Spencer, 19, they were married for 13 years and split in 2011.

After their split Sidney chose to live with Barney, while Spencer has lived with Judge and Sophia splits her time between the two.

Exes: Judge and Barney share daughters Sidney, 21, and Sophia, 14, as well as son Spencer, 19, they were married for 13 years and split in 2011 (with Tamra in 2008)

Despite the fractured family relationships prior to the diagnosis, the revelation has brought Judge back into Sidney's life and Barney back into Spencer's.

Judge, 52, also spoke to the magazine on the news of his cancer diagnosis , saying she 'couldn't believe it,' and her mind went to the worst.

'My first thought was, ""I don’t want to take my kids to their dad’s funeral,"" and immediately, any ill feelings between the two of us just vanished,' the mother-of-four said.

Adding: 'At the end of the day, none of that matters. All we have to do is rally together to make it through this.'

Her ex-husband found a bright side in his family coming together through this ordeal saying 'It’s kind of like a new beginning for me and my family. It’s really brought everyone closer together.'

He also said: 'When I told Tamra, she said she cried for like, two or three days. Things changed with our relationship from there, in a good way. We’re getting along in ways we haven’t in years. And she’s become close with my fiancé. And that shift carried across the board with my kids, too.'

Before and now: Despite the fractured family relationships prior to the diagnosis, the revelation has brought Judge back into Sidney's life and Barney back into Spencer's (with daughter Sophia in 2019)

'That’s what I’ve always wanted,’ he added. 'My fiancée, the same thing, she’s always wanted that with my ex-wife, for the kids. The kids would prefer it if we all got along. And they see that now, and it’s had such a powerful effect.'

Barney said despite being a private person he wanted to share the news himself before someone else could.

'I’m a private person, despite what my time on reality television might say,' he said. 'But I wanted to speak before someone else does and uses their words, not mine.'

Adding: 'And to speak out about it so others can see how I’ve taken this fight on with optimism, and the good this has ultimately brought my life.'

The aggressive form of treatment has taken a told on the father-of-three, leaving him barely able to eat, with slight hair loss and a buzzing in his ears.

'The process is the real bad part, it basically attacks all of your organs...It's been killing me,' he said. 'I was ready to end it the other day, the symptoms were so bad. It's almost worse than the cancer.'

Coming together: Tamra Judge said 'At the end of the day, none of that matters. All we have to do is rally together to make it through this' (With Tamra and Sidney in 2016)

A few days after his once a week chemo treatment the steroids to ease pain wear off 'I just curl up in a ball for the whole weekend in my bed, and then pray that the truck gets off me. Because I was run over by one,' he said.

Treatments that are meant to help him heal, such as a shot to increase white blood cell count, Barney said is 'a 9 out of 10 pain. It's a lot of pain.'

Due to the nature of his cancer, in his throat, lymph nodes and tonsils, swallowing even water is a painful task.

'You have an appetite but you can’t eat anything because your taste buds are gone, or they taste and smell like chemo — this metallic, disgusting taste and smell,' he says. 'My throat is swollen and bleeding which makes it difficult to swallow even water.'

But he still believes having a good mentality is the way to beat it, and praised his family for being supportive and offering to take him to treatments, but he doesn't want to be treated as a cancer patient.

'I stay strong and don’t let this take me down. Because if your attitude sucks — if you start believing, ""Oh my God, cancer’s a death sentence"" — then you’re done,' he said. 'I can survive this, at least mentally...I’m going to fight it with a smile and a laugh, and I’m going to beat it. It’s whatever my destiny is.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8017369/RHOCs-Simon-Barney-reveals-fighting-stage-3-throat-cancer-says-brought-family-together.html

Over a series of videos posted to her social media account, the Real Housewives Of Orange County star, 42, shut down shaming of her husband over his choice of footwear for an LGBT Youth Center fundraiser.

Last month, she revealed the couple's 14-year-old son Jacob was giving 'drag a try,' and how proud she was of her son for making his own path in the world.

Understand: Braunwyn Windham-Burke of RHOC shut down shaming of her husband Sean over his choice of footwear for an LGBT Youth Center fundraiser, in a series of Instagram stories posted on Tuesday

The photo that started it all: Braunwyn and Sean posted a photo ahead of an LGBT center fundraiser that showed Sean in red high heels

'I woke up to a lot of DMs, a lot of questions from a lot of you and I just wanted to say, basically, why was my husband wearing heels,' Braunwyn said as Sean has yet to respond.

She explained the choice was in a move to be allied with the LGBTQ+ community, saying: '...[We] were supporting my son who recently started showing an interest in drag and we were on our way to a fundraiser for the LGBT youth center in San Diego.

'And it was Sean’s way of supporting his son and all the other kids that the youth center helps,' the mother-of-seven continued. 'But, more importantly, it was a way to take something that so many are uncomfortable of and try to normalize it.'

She said that waking up to “all the hate that my husband’s getting for a pair of shoes sort of goes to show why this is so important. So, as long as a pair of shoes can be so pulverizing and divisive, it means we still have a lot of work to do because people aren’t understanding, people are judging.'

Adding: 'I guess I could use my platform to sell teeth whitening trays, but fundraising for an organization that does 84,000 site visits a year is more my thing.'

As reported by Now To Love this week, some fans think that Leah - played by Ada Nicodemou - was kidnapped.

Mick (Kristian Schmid) moved to WA, but fans think that he's using Leah to get to VJ and his daughter, after they left Summer Bay three years ago.

Mick had raped Billie Ashford (Tessa de Josselin) and got her pregnant when she was in a relationship with VJ. She later died of cancer after giving birth.

'I'm thinking Irene's son [Mick] he's probably trying to get Billy's baby back and took Leah to make her take him to VJ,' a fan wrote on Facebook.

654,Prince Edward and Sophie Wessex take Lady Louise and James Viscount Severn skiing in glitzy St,"['Stephanie Linning', 'Stephanie Linning For Mailonline']","Advertisement

The Earl and Countess of Wessex have taken a break from royal duties and jetted off for a family holiday in the exclusive Swiss ski resort of St Moritz.

Prince Edward and his wife Sophie, both 55, appeared in excellent spirits as they spent time with their children Lady Louise Windsor, 16, and James, Viscount Severn, 12, on the slopes over the weekend.

A half-term jaunt to the exclusive resort, which recently hosted the star-studded wedding of Dasha Zhukova and billionaire shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos, has become a family tradition for the Wessexes, who are all experienced skiers.

Neither Sophie no Edward have royal engagements scheduled for this week so it is thought they could remain in Switzerland for the rest of the week before flying back to the UK in time for the children to start school on Monday.

The delightful family photographs will bring great joy to the Queen, who was dealt yet another blow today when her nephew, David Linley, announced he has separated from his wife Serena, just days after grandson Peter Phillips' split from wife Autumn was made public.

Family first: The Countess of Wessex, Lady Louise Windsor, James, Viscount Severn and Prince Edward in St Moritz

The family ski trip will be a welcome break for Sophie and Edward, who have had a busy start to the year in the wake of Megxit and Prince Andrew's departure. The couple are thought to be in the running to take on more responsibility in light of the seismic resignations.

Last month the couple were called upon to co-host a Buckingham Palace reception with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in the absence of the Queen, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall.

However any thoughts of their busy schedule appeared far from the royal couple's minds as they headed out on the slopes on Sunday.

The family pulled up to the bottom of the mountain in black 4x4s and put on their helmets and goggles before heading up on the chair lift.

Most recently Princess Beatrice and her fiance Edo were seen arriving in the resort ahead of the wedding of close friend Dasha Zhukova to billionaire shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos.

657,Michelle Bridges' drink driving: Fitness guru tried to save herself with QC quoting Shakespeare,"['Daniel Piotrowski', 'Daniel Piotrowski For Daily Mail Australia']","Day of reckoning: Michelle Bridges, 49, was today forced to accept she wasn't 'special' in the eyes of the law - but just another drink driver

It was the day Michelle Bridges, celebrity fitness guru and TV star, was forced to accept that she wasn't 'special' in the eyes of the law - but just another drink driver.

Bridges, 49, brought celebrity glamour, a supportive entourage and legal firepower to a drab courtroom in Sydney's east on Tuesday.

It was judgment day for the former Biggest Loser trainer, and she was hoping to escape a conviction for mid-range drink driving.

But even wheeling out a heavyweight defence barrister - who insisted she was a 'special case', quoted Shakespeare and regaled the court of her achievements - couldn't win her leniency.

Bridges' predicament began with a glass of wine with dinner about 8pm on January 25, the court has heard.

She drank quite a bit afterwards - four vodka sodas, all apparently at home - before finishing up at 1am the next day, Australia Day. She rose that morning and took her son, five, to Nielsen Park beach, not far from her Potts Point home.

The incident came while the former Biggest Loser star was reckoning with the collapse her relationship with Steve 'Commando' Willis

Bridges (second from right) rose to fame with The Biggest Loser co-stars Shannan Ponton, Tiffiny Hall and 'the Commando' - her former lover

Bridges was driving home at 11.25am when officers at a roadside breath stop noticed her Range Rover broke suddenly and veered into the second lane of New South Head Road.

Police decided to pull Bridges over. When she wound the window down, police noticed the fitness star appeared 'nervous'. Her hands were shaking, voice was trembling and face was flushed, court documents said.

The glamorous fitness trainer never suggested she was anything but guilty to the offence - proof, her lawyer claimed, that she was a 'straight shooter'

The 12 Week Body Transformation founder claimed she had a swirl of mouth wash about five minutes before she was pulled over.

But officers observed she seemed 'mildly affected' by alcohol, she admitted drinking 'last night' and she failed the test.

Back at the police station, the wiry fitness queen admitted she had actually drank quite a lot, a statement of facts said.

It wasn't long after a criminal charge was laid that the incident hit the headlines.

Bridges, to her credit, never suggested that she was anything but guilty.

She revealed she had been going through a 'difficult time', having just split with her high profile boyfriend, Steve 'The Commando' Willis, who she met on The Biggest Loser. That had apparently played a part in her heavy drinking.

She admitted her shame and embarrassment and suffered a terrible blow to her wholesome public image.

It was shame she relived again on Tuesday as she walked the media gauntlet at Waverley Court.

The stress was written all over Bridges' face as she leaped out of a car about 9.15am.

She powered past at least a dozen media - cameras in her face, clicking and flashing.

Time to face the music: A magistrate told celebrity fitness trainer Michelle Bridges what she didn't want to hear on Tuesday - she wasn't getting leniency, and would be convicted

Once inside, she, her lawyers and three supporters huddled in a conference room all morning, even through the court's lunchbreak.

'This is a special case Michelle Bridges' lawyer, Queen's Counsel Tony Bellanto

Her lawyers were trying to secure her time a magistrate who would knock the case over in an afternoon and bring her month-long nightmare to an end.

About 2pm, it was Bridges' turn to face the music.

She strode into the main court of the small complex, and sat in the front row in a black suit, next to her lawyer. Metres away sat other people accused of similarly serious, but low-level crimes. None appeared to have lawyers with them - let alone a QC.

From the beginning, it was clear Bridges had an uphill battle asking the court for leniency.

Tony Bellanto QC told Magistrate Allison Hawkins - newly minted, fresh from the bar - that Bridges' crime, which she was pleading guilty to, had 'cut to (her) core'. He pleaded with the magistrate for leniency, saying a conviction for Bridges would be a 'scar on the record for the rest of her life.'

The drink driving charge is a rare moment of humiliation for Bridges, who has gained national fame as a celebrity fitness guru

'She's a good mother, she's hardworking', he said. She had contributed so much to the community, he said.

He cited an extraordinary statistic in his submissions: 'Over 10 years, she is responsible for the Australian public losing two million kilograms in weight,' he said. 'Now that is powerful. '

Meanwhile, he argued, Bridges had written a letter of apology to the court and was remorseful. She had learned so much from completing a program for traffic offenders.

She could be an 'advocate for change' thanks to her new understanding of drink driving, Mr Bellanto said. She was 'entitled' to leniency from the court 'given her capacity to make a difference', he argued.

But Magistrate Hawkins said the 'absolute majority' of cases like Bridges' - mid-range drink drivers - were convicted.

'So why should I not record a conviction in this case?' she asked, 'considering there is a child in the car - which increases the objective seriousness of the case?'

'This is a special case, she's a rather special type of person,' Mr Bellanto said - drawing a sharp question from the magistrate.

'Are you advancing there is a ""special tier"" of justice to a person who has a special standing in the community?' she asked.

A middle-aged man sitting in the public gallery muttered: 'Of course there is'.

If a person is a person of good character ... it's like money in the bank Bridges' lawyer Tony Bellanto QC

But Mr Bellanto had a more eloquent answer - that Bridges was of good character and that meant something in the justice system.

'If a person is a person of good character ..... (it's) like money in the bank, the law says you're entitled to draw on that.'

But Ms Hawkins said she was bound by law to balance a person's good character with the community's expectation that actions come with consequences.

Mr Bellanto - who was admitted as a lawyer in 1967 - closed his submissions by drawing on the work of playwright William Shakespeare.

'Oftentimes excusing of a fault, Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,' he said, quoting the play The Life and Death of King John.

The police prosecutor then only had one thing to say to the court: was the magistrate considering not handing Bridges a conviction?

Ms Hawkins was blunt. 'No, I'm not,' she said, and ordered the fitness guru to stand up.

Magistrate Hawkins said she accepted Bridges was genuinely remorseful.

But she warned Bridges that the fact she was going through a relationship breakdown would be cold comfort if she had she injured someone in an accident.

She convicted Bridges, fined her $750, disqualified her licence for three months and ordered she install an alcohol interlock device on her car.

Bridges huddled with her supporters and then left the courtroom. She was just another drink driver to pass through Waverley Court - but one nonetheless expected to make a tearful statement to the media.

Tearfully, she told a media pack: 'I would like to apologise to my family, friends and community for this gross error in judgment,' she said.

'The consequences of these actions will haunt me forever.'

She then jumped into a waiting car.

Someone else was driving.

Michelle Bridges begs for leniency for 'helping Australians lose two million kilograms' as she pleads GUILTY to drink driving after blowing 0.086 in her Range Rover with her son, 5, in the car

Bridges said she was having a 'difficult time' following her break-up Commando (together, above) when the incident occurred

Former Biggest Loser star and celebrity trainer Michelle Bridges has pleaded guilty to drink driving.

Bridges, 49, was convicted of the criminal offence in court on Tuesday, despite her legal team arguing she had a 'special case'.

The fitness guru blew 0.086 when she was pulled over in her Range Rover with her five-year-old son in the car, at about 11.25am on Australia Day, as she drove through Bellevue Hill, in Sydney's eastern suburbs.

But her legal representative Tony Bellanto QC argued she should not be convicted, citing the 'millions of kilograms' she has helped Australians shed.

'Over 10 years she is responsible for the Australian public losing two million kilograms in weight,' Mr Bellatoni told the court during sentencing.

'Now that's powerful - two million kilograms over ten years.'

'A conviction would act as a 'scar on her record for the rest of her life … when in fact she's a good mother, she's hardworking and this has had a most profound effect on her life,' he said.

'It's a special case, she's a special person'.

Magistrate Allison Hawkins rebuked the submission saying 'Are you advancing that there is a special tier of justice to a person who has special standing in the community?'

The magistrate said while she appreciated Bridges had been humiliated, the fact she had been going through a tough time would have been cold comfort to victims had she had an accident.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8015057/Michelle-Bridges-drink-driving-Fitness-guru-tried-save-QC-quoting-Shakespeare.html

Despite Billie's success, only four nominations out of a possible 25 in the categories which are not gender-specific feature women.

The awards are voted for by around 1,500 people from across the UK music industry including journalists, record label employees and musicians.

665,Model who recorded Harvey Weinstein admitting he groped her says she doesn't regret coming forward,"['Megan Sheets', 'Megan Sheets For Dailymail.Com']","Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, 27, recorded Harvey Weinstein as he admitted to groping her in 2015, but the Manhattan District Attorney's office refused to bring charges against the movie mogul. Five years later, Gutierrez says she doesn't regret coming forward - despite the subsequent smear campaign that derailed her career

An Italian-Filipina model who recorded Harvey Weinstein as he admitted to groping her before the Manhattan District Attorney's office inexplicably refused to bring charges against him says she doesn't regret coming forward - despite the subsequent smear campaign that derailed her career.

Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, 27, was one of the first women to publicly accuse Weinstein of sexual misconduct in 2015 when she went to police and claimed he had fondled her breasts and put his hand up her skirt during a business meeting.

Investigators had her wear a wire when she went to meet with the producer the following day. In the tapes he was heard apologizing for his inappropriate touching as he begged the then-22-year-old to go to his hotel room.

Gutierrez investigators initially congratulated her for capturing Weinstein's damning remarks on tape and insisted that her efforts would land him behind bars.

Her confidence in the justice system was soon crushed as the Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance declined to bring charges against Weinstein amid intense pressure from the producer's lawyers and a vicious smear campaign the mogul's team launched to destroy her credibility.

Desperate to protect herself and her family from further damage, Gutierrez signed a million-dollar non-disclosure agreement and turned over her electronic devices so her recordings of Weinstein could be deleted.

But she held onto one copy of the tapes, believing that they were the one thing that could definitively prove she was telling the truth.

Two years later she agreed to let Ronan Farrow publish part of her story in his bombshell expose which helped spark Weinstein's downfall in 2017.

Gutierrez recounted the traumatic ordeal in an interview with The Cut last week, just as the first criminal sex abuse case against Weinstein came to a close in New York City.

Gutierrez, an Italian-Filipina actress (left in 2018), met Weinstein (right in court Tuesday) at his New York Spring Spectacular show in New York City on March 26, 2015. She claims he fondled her breasts and stuck his hand up her skirt during a business meeting the next day

Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance declined to press charges against Weinstein, even though Gutierrez had recorded him admitted to misconduct. Vance's office is now leading the first criminal case against Weinstein, for which jury deliberations began Tuesday

Gutierrez, a former Miss Italy contestant, first met Weinstein at his New York Spring Spectacular show at Radio City Music Hall on March 26, 2015.

The pair met up to discuss her career the following day, after which Gutierrez went to police and claimed that he'd groped her.

'I knew the moment I got to the police station that Weinstein was dangerous,' she told The Cut in the interview published Tuesday.

'When I said his name and that he'd assaulted me, the guy at the glass door answered with: ""Again?"" That gave me strength; that made me just want to do something about it.'

She wore a wire when she met with Weinstein the next day at the Tribeca Grand Hotel and confronted him in an effort to get him to admit on tape what he'd done.

Gutierrez said she began to lose hope in her case against Weinstein when she met with Martha Bashford (pictured), who was head of the NYPD's Sex Crimes unit at the time. She said Bashford interrogated her as if she was the criminal

'Oh, please. I'm sorry,' he was heard saying. 'I won't do it again … I will never do another thing to you. Five minutes. Don't ruin your friendship with me for five minutes.'

Gutierrez said investigators were very supportive of her when she handed over the tapes.

'They were saying: ""Ambra, you did it. You put him in jail. He's going to go to jail,""' she recalled, describing the relief she felt when she went home that night.

But she would soon learn that her faith in the system was 'naïve', beginning when she met with Marsha Bashford, who was head of the NYPD's Sex Crimes Unit at the time and resigned earlier this month amid Weinstein's trial.

'Bashford interrogated me like I was the criminal, with questions like, ""Have you ever been a prostitute?"" Or, ""Have you ever gotten gifts?"" Or, ""Have you ever asked for a movie role?""

'And I'm like, ""Did you hear the recordings?"" The recordings made it clear that this person was absolutely pushing for me to go in that room and to assault me, pushing the fact that my career was going to be ruined and he's a famous person and that I'm nothing.

'So, what wasn't clear? Even if I was a prostitute - which I was not - every person has the right to not do things with people that they don't want to. I remember the moment I left that room after that interrogation, I thought: ""This is not going right.""'

Gutierrez (pictured in 2018) says she was 'naive' to believe that the justice system would punish Weinstein based on her account alone, but says she doesn't regret coming forward

Matters only got worse from there, as Gutierrez was battered with negative publicity.

Tabloids branded her 'Grope Girl' and ran nasty stories about her past alongside photos of her modeling bikinis, causing her to be dropped by designers and shows.

'It was kind of easy for Weinstein, with the type of people that he knows and power to put me down,' she said. 'The public opinion at first was with me and then, after a little bit, it was against me.'

'I work with my image, so ruining my reputation was destroying me completely,' she added.

The DA's office never called Gutierrez to inform her that Weinstein wouldn't be prosecuted, so she found out the news through the media like everyone else.

'I thought already that everything was falling apart and they [the DA's office] would not come to help me,' she said.

'I didn't speak much English, but I could understand what was happening, and it was all against me.'

Gutierrez made the decision to sign an NDA with Weinstein's lawyers after her brother called her and said that someone had come to his work asking about her.

'My blood just turned super cold. I was shaking and everything. I'm like, ""Okay, that’s it."" That's when I decided to sign this agreement,' she said.

She vividly remembers the day she went to an office in Midtown to sign the NDA.

'There was the lawyer for Harvey, very nervous talking to me, saying: ""Thank you so much for being here. We're so glad to have you, and I'm so sorry.""'

She said she repeatedly told the lawyer: 'I'm going to sign this, but if I hear of him [Weinstein] hurting anyone else, I would not care about [the paper] I signed.'

After Gutierrez came forward tabloids branded her 'Grope Girl' and ran nasty stories about her past alongside photos of her modeling bikinis, causing her to lose modeling jobs

'I work with my image, so ruining my reputation was destroying me completely,' Gutierrez told The Cut. She is pictured during a photoshoot in 2017

Under the terms of the NDA Gutierrez had to turn over all of her electronic devices and email passwords so the lawyers could ensure that her recordings of Weinstein were removed.

She had sent the tapes to five different email addresses on the day they were recorded. She told her lawyer that she forgot the password to one of those email accounts so it was never checked.

Gutierrez told The Cut she wasn't sure what she was going to with the tapes, but that she knew she 'had to get those out'.

'That was the key to getting my life back,' she said. 'Being believed, getting my name back to who I was or I am right now. That I wasn't lying. I was right. I told the truth.'

Over the following few months Gutierrez spiraled into a 'very deep depression'.

'I knew what the truth was, and that nobody would listen, and I didn't know how to get those recordings out. I didn't know who to trust,' she said.

In 2017 she found hope in Farrow, who included her account in his scathing piece outlining sexual misconduct allegations against Weinstein in the New Yorker that fall.

Farrow's report and another similar expose from the New York Times were awarded a Pulitzer Prize and are credited with sparking the #MeToo movement.

'That day that those recordings came out publicly, I think I was so happy that I smiled like the whole day,' Gutierrez said. 'It was so weird. It was like I had a baby or something.'

Guttierez agreed to let Ronan Farrow publish part of her story in his bombshell expose which helped spark Weinstein's downfall in 2017. She is pictured with Farrow last month during a recording for his podcast Catch and Kill

Five years after her own experience, Gutierrez says she still gets overcome with emotion when she hears what other victims went through with Weinstein.

'I know what it means feeling like you're in a cage and having the possibility to talk and understand that someone would be on your side,' she said.

She said she has no regrets about reporting Weinstein despite the backlash she personally endured.

'I would've done it a million times,' she said.

Asked whether she is concerned that the same office that ignored her claims is prosecuting the current case against Weinstein, Gutierrez replied: 'I know, but how can you just not do what is right if everyone is watching you?

'I'm here waiting, very anxious. I really hope they get justice and they see this person getting what he deserves, because he didn't do it once. He did it too many times. It just makes my heart cry.'

She said that even if the jury doesn't convict Weinstein, she still has hope for the Los Angeles case against him.

And even if both cases fail to result in a conviction, she is grateful that the truth is finally out.

'People know now what's going on, and Ronan Farrow's still writing about it, and you guys are writing about it, and so many others wrote about it,' she said.

'There's more women having their strength back, the support that before that we didn't have. It's something that at least we achieved, and it's a lot already.'

Weinstein is currently awaiting a jury's verdict on five counts of sexual assault.

He faces life in prison if convicted.

The disgraced producer has always denied any wrongdoing and says any and all sexual contact he had was consensual.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8016627/Model-recorded-Harvey-Weinstein-admitting-groped-says-doesnt-regret-coming-forward.html

They have been staying in hotels and visiting casinos regularly for the past year.

There have been claims she has sold her home in Georgia as well as a diamond ring to keep up her lifestyle with Doak.

Last week the site said that Mama will not be reaping any profits from this season of the family's reality TV show as she will not be 'an active participant.'

It was added that her daughters are 'actually happy' she won't reportedly be paid because they fear how her alleged addiction drives her spending.

In March, Mama June and Doak were arrested for felony drug possession at a gas station over crack cocaine, just days before the family's third season aired.

Despite the upcoming plot centering around the struggling reality star's drug use and family estrangement, Mama June will not be compensated because she didn't sit down for interviews.

In early February fans got an early look of the Georgia-based family's show, which featured Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson, 14, enjoying a bowl of coco puffs by herself.

Fans of the estranged family can predict a reunion won't be pretty, as Mama June took to Instagram last Thursday admitting to some of her mistakes and asking for her family's forgiveness.

The Here Comes Honey Boo Boo star has four children: Anna, 24, Jessica, 22, Lauryn - known as Pumpkin, 19, and Alana.

The mother of four would have benefited greatly from the show's paycheck, as she appears to be struggling beyond just family issues.

The reality star's sister Joanne has encouraged her to break off things with her boyfriend and focus on getting professional help for her issues with addiction.

In her turbulent year, she has been forced to make more tough calls, including taking a cash offer for $50,000 less than the value of her home and being thrown out from a hotel over an unpaid bill.

Noticing the car had an improperly installed license plate dangling from a single screw, the detectives approached the car and found Kelley in the driver's seat and a man, Richard Wilcutt, in the passenger seat, according to arrest affidavits.

During the questioning, a concerned citizen handed the cops a bag they'd seen someone throw from the car's passenger side, which contained a torn up box of pseudo-ephedrine and a receipt for Coleman fuel.

Recognizing these as ingredients used in making meth, the wily detectives ran the pair's names through a national database and found they'd made a pattern of psuedo-ephedrine purchases consistent with cooking meth.

Using security camera footage, they found that Kelley had purchased the pseudo-ephedrine, which they found in Wilcutt's possession when he was searched.

Both were arrested and charged with promotion of meth manufacture, but Kelley later pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of possessing meth.

668,Hollywood sex therapist got two restraining orders against ex-boyfriend accused of murdering her,"['Lauren Fruen', 'Lauren Fruen For Dailymail.Com']","Hollywood sex therapist Amie Harwick had requested two restraining orders against the ex-boyfriend accused of murdering her, it has been revealed.

The 38-year-old was found unconscious on the ground at around 1.15am on Saturday after officers responded to a report of a 'woman screaming' in a Hollywood Hills neighborhood, the Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement.

She had been thrown from her third floor apartment's balcony, according to police and the coroner confirmed Tuesday that she died of blunt force injuries to her head and torso.

Authorities said they arrested Gareth Pursehouse, 41, at around 4.30pm on Saturday in Playa Del Rey on suspicion of murder.

It is not known how Pursehouse allegedly knew where Amie was now living, but the pair had shared a home together ten years ago. Harwick first got a temporary restraining order against Pursehouse in 2011 and a second a year later.

Now friends say it was the former couple's chance meeting last month at an event he was photographing that 'reignited his obsessive preoccupation with her'.

Beverly Hills sex therapist Hernando Chaves told The LA Times: 'It was the absolute worst possible luck.' Friend Vera Duffy added: 'She said that when he saw her, he just went ballistic. He lost it. He made a scene.'

Chaves added: 'She was very scared. She said, ""What am I going to do? I let my roommate know, I have home security"". '

Harwick first got a temporary restraining order against Pursehouse in 2011. After she did not attend a follow-up hearing the order was reportedly dismissed 'for lack of prosecution'.

Then in April 2012 a judge granted her request for protection after she got another temporary restraining order. That order expired two weeks ago.

Harwick had previously told friends she feared he would hurt her.

Friend Eric Breslow told KTLA: 'This was a constant thing that she talked about, that she was afraid of this particular guy and it was always something that kind of followed her. It scared her enough to tell friends that, gee, I think I should get some mace or pepper spray.'

The doctor's roommate told police that after Pursehouse broke in, they ran out of the apartment to get help for her.

By the time officers arrived at the property, she had been thrown from the balcony.

Amie's ex-fiance Drew Carey paid tribute to Harwick Monday. The Price Is Right host said: 'I would like to thank you in advance for giving myself and everyone who loved Amie privacy while we try to work through this tragic situation.'

His statement came after it was announced that the show has cancelled this week's tapings.

In a statement Drew Carey, picture with Amie, said: 'Amie and I had a love that people are lucky to have once in a lifetime. She was a positive force in the world, a tireless and unapologetic champion for women, and passionate about her work as a therapist'

Amie was found unconscious on the ground at around 1.15am on Saturday after officers responded to a report of a 'woman screaming' in a Hollywood Hills neighborhood

According to his LinkedIn profile, Pursehouse has worked as a photographer as well as a software engineer and developer. His most recent job was as lead architect at Internet Brands.

Hours after Harwick died and before his arrest, Pursehouse, who is active on Twitter, posted messages on the site.

'You can’t get fit without that new gym clothing,' he wrote at 9.07am on Saturday. 'But they won’t give you that gear until you’re fit. Soo … Tough t***ies bucko.'

Hours before the alleged murder, Pursehouse tweeted about politics. 'I can’t figure out why gerrymandering isn’t a federal crime,' he wrote.

His Twitter page is full of tweets critical of President Donald Trump.

'Reminder... Once Trump is not president, the FBI can prosecute him for all the Mueller report findings…,' he wrote on Wednesday.

Carey and Harwick first made their relationship public in June 2017. They were engaged in January 2018.

Wendy Williams, 55, has come under fire for making a tasteless joke about her death, telling viewers: 'She was killed... not by Drew, but by the ex... come on down,' using Carey's catch-phrase from The Price Is Right.

Harwick, the author of The New Sex Bible for Women, and Carey split in November 2018 after dating for more than a year.

Harwick is a well known sex and family therapist in the Hollywood area.

She received her degree in psychology from California Polytechnic University in Pomona, California.

Designer: The WAG, 33, exuded style as she donned a £340 fawn Bella Freud jumper paired with a black and cream fluffy cardigan as she battled the elements

While the couple have taken to Instagram in recent months to mark birthdays and anniversaries, they haven't been seen out together since last August.

Back in August, Wayne and Coleen were pictured together in Washington, before they moved back to the UK.

Before that, they were seen holidaying together in Barbados, a month after his 'barmaid bender.'

Their holiday has marked a 'fresh start' in their relationship following Wayne's 10-hour booze bender in Florida in February, where he downed shots with bar girl Vickie Rosiek until 2.30am.

A source told The Sun at the time: 'Coleen is adamant Wayne can change his ways and she is helping him get out of the hole he’d fallen into. This holiday marks a fresh start and things are going well.

Sighting; Coleen was spotted on a rare outing with husband Wayne on Monday as they headed out to pick up some breakfast (pictured on Instagram earlier this week)

'She is desperate for Wayne to end his childish antics and start growing up.'

Meanwhile, Coleen's outing on Monday marked the first time she had been seen since responding to Rebekah Vardy's emotional Loose Women appearance amid their public feud.

The full statement: In October last year, Rebekah was explosively accused by Coleen of leaking stories about her to The Sun newspaper

Last week, a representative for Coleen tweeted that she is 'confident in the legal process' and feels no need to comment further after Rebekah told how the WAG war 'was the worst thing she had been through since being abused by her stepdad'.

Royal chef Darren McGrady has revealed how Princess Diana (seen in London in 1989) changed his cooking style from heavy sauces to healthy eating, and would ask him to cook her stuffed bell peppers several times a week - sometimes casually eating in the kitchen with him

Speaking about the first time he met the late royal, he said: 'I remember the first time I met Princess Diana, I was at Balmoral Castle working in the pastry kitchen making apple pies.

'The pastry chef was across one side of the table and we were just chatting. I looked up and right behind him was Princess Diana just stood there.

'My face was a picture - I was beetroot red and just staring at the Princess. ""Hello"" and ""Goodbye"" is all I remember saying.'

Darren then moved onto cooking for Diana and William and Harry, revealing: 'When I joined Princess Diana, she was patron of 119 different charities, working out at the gym three times a week, looking the best she ever did.

'She had conquered and confronted the bulimia and she said to me, ""Darren, you take care of all the fat, and I'll take care of the carbs at the gym.

Sharing her diet habits, he said: 'The princess didn't eat beef at all, occasionally she'd have lamb if she was entertaining, but for the most part it was vegetarian dishes - like peppers and stuffed eggplant.

'She'd love eating fish as well, like rainbow trout and all of her food contained very little fat - certainly no creams or butters.

'If there was any misconception it was that she didn't like food, she really did. She was into juicing before it was even invented. She was always ahead of the trend and kept me on my toes.'

And Diana made the kitchen a more relaxed place to work, with the chef recalling: 'If she was eating alone she'd often come and eat in the kitchen and come in while I was still cooking. It was so relaxed when she was in the kitchen, once she made me a coffee. It was so much more relaxed at Kensington Palace.

'She'd share a lot of stories with us. We did a menu book for Diana but she never stuck to it while the Queen was religious - whatever you stuck on the menu three days ahead she'd have.

'Princess Diana however no way! She'd say she wasn't in the mood for a dish on the same day - the menu book was a waste of time really.

'William and Harry, even though they were princes still had royal palettes so I had to fool them when I was cooking healthy food.'

'Connie, get over yourself. You forced him to write a stupid letter to you, but you can’t even draw a picture with him. Learn to enjoy yourself or just keep being a prude,' a third added.

Emma Corrin has been spotted filming scenes with Josh O'Connor and the young actor playing Prince William as The Crown continues shooting for its fourth series.

The actress donned a fake belly to transform into a pregnant Princess of Wales at a Buckingham Palace Easter Egg hunt set in the Spring of 1984.

Running around a field in a bright blue smock dress, the actress cradled a blonde-haired child playing a toddler Prince William, and was seen laughing with Josh, who reprises his role as Prince Charles and Tobias Menzies who plays Prince Philip.

Family fun: Emma Corrin has been spotted filming scenes with Josh O'Connor and the young actor playing Prince William as The Crown continues shooting for its fourth series

Emma captured Diana's mannerisms and style as the cameras rolled. She was dressed for the eighties time period in a bright blue midi dress with gold buttons and her blonde hair was styled into Diana's signature short crop.

Josh meanwhile was the spitting image of a young Prince Charles in a brown tweed jacket and maroon tie.

The young actor playing a toddler Prince William looked adorable in a green cardigan and white shirt as he held an Easter basket.

The character of Prince William has previously been spotted on set, when Emma and Josh filmed scenes last year for the family's 1983 tour of Australia when William was nine months old.

Style: She was dressed for the eighties time period in a bright blue midi dress with gold buttons and her blonde hair was styled into Diana's signature short crop

The long-awaited fourth series of the Netflix show will document Diana's meeting and eventual marriage to Prince Charles along with the births and early years of the two Princes.

Diana married Charles in 1981, and the couple welcomed sons William in 1982 and Harry in 1984. After separating in 1991, the couple divorced in 1997.

Emma's casting was announced in April 2019, with The Crown's creator Peter Morgan calling her 'a brilliant talent who immediately captivated us when she came in for the part of Diana Spencer.'

'As well as having the innocence and beauty of a young Diana, she also has, in abundance, the range and complexity to portray an extraordinary woman who went from anonymous teenager to becoming the most iconic woman of her generation.'

Young family: The scene was set when Diana was pregnant with her and Charles' second child, Prince Harry, who was born in September 1984. Pictured right, Diana, Charles and William in June 1984

Mother: Emma cradled the young actor playing a toddler Prince William who gave a cheeky grin at Tobias Menzies, who reprises his role as Diana's father-in-law Prince Philip

All star: Marion Bailey (left), who plays the Queen Mother, was also spotted on set for the family Easter egg hunt

Feeling it: Emma looked out of breath as she chased around a cheeky Prince William and his Easter egg basket

Speaking to The Wrap in November, Josh praised his new onscreen love interest Emma, gushing: 'I obviously won't go into exactly what we're doing, but we're shooting Season 4 at the moment and Emma's doing an extraordinary job.'

Returning alongside Josh for another series of the Netflix hit are Olivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth, Tobias Menzie as the Duke of Edinburgh, Helena Bonham Carter as Princess Margaret and Erin Doherty as Princess Anne.

The next series will be released later this year, but it was recently revealed that the show will conclude after its fifth season, with Imelda Staunton taking the throne as its final Queen Elizabeth II.

Show creator Peter Morgan confirmed the Netflix drama - currently airing its third season with Olivia Colman in the regal role - would not include a sixth season while revealing Imelda, 64, will take the role 'into the 21st century'.

This means that current Royal scandals including the allegations made against Prince Andrew as well as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's 'Megxit' drama won't be featured on the Netflix hit.

Family of three: The cast were filming in parkland to replicate the grounds of Buckingham Palace

Doting father: Josh was seen grabbing the mischievous actor who plays his son William by the arm

Off we go! Josh beamed as he had fun with the young actor in the sunny setting, while Emma looked on

Animated: The up and coming actress looked right at ease on set, animatedly chatting with cast members in between takes

Harry Potter star Imelda said: 'I have loved watching The Crown from the very start. As an actor it was a joy to see how both Claire Foy and Olivia Colman brought something special and unique to Peter Morgan's scripts.

'I am genuinely honoured to be joining such an exceptional creative team and to be taking The Crown to its conclusion.'

Series three of The Crown hit Netflix in November 2019, with Oscar-winner Olivia taking the throne from Claire Foy, who portrayed the monarch in the first two seasons.

Peter said: 'I'm absolutely thrilled to confirm Imelda Staunton as Her Majesty The Queen for the fifth and final season, taking The Crown into the 21st century.

'Imelda is an astonishing talent and will be a fantastic successor to Claire Foy and Olivia Colman.'

Retro style: Actors were dressed in eighties style to replicate to the time period

We are family: Marion, who has played the Queen Mother in series three and four of the Netflix drama, looked in high spirits

Sit! Erin Doherty was also see on set, in her role as a young Princess Anne. She got to grips with some dog training while dressed in a checked waistcoat and matching skirt

Family fun: Cast members milled around the picturesque setting with filming equipment in the background

Peter has also now revealed he decided against making a sixth season of The Crown because there 'has to be distance' between real life and the show.

The writer and producer admitted he had initially sketched out storylines for further episodes beyond series five.

But he explained to the Daily Mail's Baz Bamigboye: 'You can't fully examine incidents that happened yesterday. There has to be ten to 20 years' distance. And in some instances much longer.'

Peter promised the final series, which won't be filmed until 2021 or 2022 will be 'explosive' and will culminate with Britain entering the new millennium.

However, the showrunner admitted he would like to visit the royal family again in five to 10 years’ time, but to examine a different period.

He said: 'I don't know yet, but I might go further backwards in time, perhaps before this Queen.'

The fourth series is currently in production at Elstree Studios and locations across the UK and will see the introduction of Diana as well as Margaret Thatcher, played by Gillian Anderson.

Rising star: Erin played with an actress playing a younger member of the royal family in between takes

Huge shoot: The scale of the production could be glimpsed by the large amount of extras on set

Spring time fun: Josh was dressed in a smart brown tweed jacket and tie for his return as Prince Charles

Getting on well: Emma seemed to have struck up a close bond with the young actor playing William who beamed in her arms

It was initially thought the series would run for six series, spanning six decades.

Cindy Holland, vice president of original content at Netflix, said: 'The first three seasons of The Crown defined an era, and I know the upcoming fourth season will build further on that success.

'It's a stunning example of award-winning entertainment, created in the UK and loved by millions of fans around the world.

'I fully support Peter Morgan's creative decision and am excited to see how he, Imelda Staunton and the cast and crew of season five, bring this landmark series to a fitting and spectacular end.'

Key moments in the Royal Family's history the show will not cover includes Meghan and Harry's decision to step back as senior Royals.

Monarch: Olivia Colman resumes her role as Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in the fourth series

Old face: Helena Bonham Carter plays Princess Margaret for the third and fourth series, taking over the role from Vanessa Kirby

Transformed: Tobias Menzies plays Prince Philip, taking over playing the character from Doctor Who star Matt Smith

Meghan and Harry rocked the foundations of the Royal Family when they announced their shock decision as they 'work to become financially independent'.

Executive producer Suzanne Mackie shared earlier this month: 'To be honest, whatever the life of 'The Crown' is after where we are now, I doubt we'll ever go as far into the present day.'

Whilst Peter added back in 2018: 'I feel uncomfortable writing about events within a certain time period. Let's wait twenty years and see what there is to say about Meghan Markle.

'I don't know what there is to say about Meghan Markle at the moment. I wouldn't know and I wouldn't presume. She'll only become interesting once we've had twenty years to digest who she is and what her impact has been.

'If I were to write about Meghan Markle I would automatically be writing journalistically. I've got nothing to say about Meghan Markle.'

695,Russell Brand writes impassioned tribute to Caroline Flack,"['Ciara Farmer', 'Ciara Farmer For Mailonline']","'The line then that separates people who kill themselves and people that don't is vague and uncertain, it is a line within each of us, not between us.'

I recently performed a monologue, a 'verbatim piece' made up of extracts of the last written words of people who had taken their own lives. I was grateful to the surviving family members for allowing me such intimate access to such a painful and personal artefact.

There is so much shame around suicide, so much shame and so much pain. The writing itself; some in the form of emails, some blogs, some old-fashioned notes, provided a blurred portal into the mind of the person that would go on to take their own life.

I sensed a familiar resonance throughout these varied pieces, a common tune in the expression of these distinct people; it was 'ordinariness'. The ordinariness of the thoughts, feelings and events that led them to make the ultimate act of self sacrifice.

'I don't feel good enough', 'I'm lonely', 'I'm worthless', 'I'm scared I'm in too much debt', 'I'm scared I've hurt too many people', 'I am unlovable'. Normal feelings that I've felt many times, that I suspect we all feel at times.

The line then that separates people who kill themselves and people that don't is vague and uncertain, it is a line within each of us, not between us.

We just don't know who will or who won't be pushed to a point of such inward pain and desperation that the dreadful certainty of suicide and the despair it inflicts on those left behind are insufficient deterrents.

I am angry and sad that Caroline Flack found herself in that place. I am sad because she was a lovely little person, a real laugh, a dynamo and the idea that she had been so drained of hope by her circumstances chokes me.

I am angry because I have watched this play out before with vulnerable people in the public eye and I would like to slay with some righteous sword the salacious, foaming, incessant poking, trolling judgment that chased her to the grave. The way it did with Jade Goodie [sic], the way it did with Amy Winehouse.

I know there is no single 'media' or 'social media' I know they are complex machines that comprise, by their nature, millions of participants. But our systems operate in accordance with values and the way these values are set and the consequences of these values are obviously in serious need of reevaluation.

I have resigned from fame because it brought out the worst in me, vanity, insecurity, jealousy, competitiveness. Most people I've spoken to have comparable experiences, it's hard to endure what celebrity does to your mental health without a robust constitution or strong counter measures to ground and protect you.

There is little to be gained from allocating blame now that Caroline is dead. Her vulnerability was obvious when the CPS pursued her case and when she took another turn in the barrel with the media and social media.

I've seen that there are petitions to regulate the press and I admire the optimism of the enterprise. But the media is made up of people, the world of celebrity is made up of people, social media is made up of people.

All culture, all values pass through the consciousness of individuals and collectives. If we want the world to change, for less people to die in pain and shame then we should pause before we next vent a pleasurable stab of vindictive judgment or jeering condemnation.

Social media is a network of connections. We can use those connections to convey love and support and kindness, all ideas that can be rationally understood as expressions of our unity.

While we are unique and different, beautiful in our vast and distinct identities – and all identities can be honoured, we are all capable of kindness, we are all capable of redemption, we are all worthy of love.

Whenever we speak and act and relate we emanate intent through the invisible threads that connect us. Communication is the creation of community, what kind of communities are we creating?

Caroline was surrounded by friends and families that loved her, that love her still through a shattered lens of anguish, and that love could not incubate her or protect her from the pain and shame that ended her life.

We have the power to hurt one another and the power to heal one another, perhaps that's the only power we have. We can never see the positive impact of our actions, the times when our kindness and compassion may have saved a life but we can see what happens in its absence.

As long as our public values continue to be an expression of lower human instincts none of us are exempt from the pain and shame that closed in on the bright and playful light that used to shine from Caroline.

Our best hope is to build relationships and communities based on kindness, forgiveness and compassion, not easy values to maintain given the complexity within us and without us but Caroline's death shows us that the alternative is just too sad to bear.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8015623/Russell-Brand-pens-impassioned-tribute-Caroline-Flack.html

Bond: Billie Eilish will perform her Bond theme at Tuesday's BRIT Awards. And ahead of the performance the singer has revealed all about the creative process behind the track

Finneas explained that Bond star Daniel Craig is involved in every aspect of their movie franchise, including the theme song.

'He had to like it. If Daniel doesn't like it then you don't get the job,' he said while Billie added: 'He has a big say in it. We learned that from this. He's really involved. We haven't met him but he's got to like it before they move on.'

The duo wrote the song for the 25th Bond movie on a tour bus in Texas over just three days, after failing to get the creative juices flowing in the studio.

'We've been wanting to make a Bond song for years. I remember at the beginning of last year we told our whole team that if any Bond things come up we want to be involved if we can possibly be,' Billie revealed of her long-held ambition.

Taking charge: Finneas explained that Bond star Daniel Craig is involved in every aspect of their movie franchise, including the theme song

Finneas agreed, explaining: 'There are few things as desirable as doing a Bond song and we didn't take the opportunity lightly. We really just tried to work as hard as we could to prove ourselves worthy of that.'

Billie will perform the track live at Tuesday night's star-studded BRIT Awards at London's O2, and the seasoned performer admitted: 'I'm so scared. We've never performed it ever, so it feels so weird that it's in the public, especially now that I'm performing it and I'm hitting a note I've never hit before. I'm scared.'

The interview also saw Billie discuss her recent decision to take a step back from social media, and specifically stop reading the comments on her Instagram posts.

'I stopped like two days ago. I've stopped reading comments fully. It was ruining my life. It's weird. The cooler the things you get to do, the more people hate you,' she said.

'Cancel culture is insane. The internet is a bunch of trolls and the problem is a lot of it is really funny. It's anything for a joke. People say anything to make people laugh.'

'It's insane that I have ever been reading comments. I should've stopped long ago but the problem is I've always wanted to stay in touch with my fans and people have ruined that for me and for them. That sucks.'

'I still try to like fan posts. If I see fans anywhere I just want to talk to them. They're people, they're me. They're like friends of mine, but the internet is ruining my life, so I turned it off.'
